The NPA’s Prohibition on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is\nNot Limited to Prosecution for Conduct Between 2ool and 2oo7 or for\nParticular Statutory Offenses.\n\nFinally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision\nas “limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7 . . . and to violations of statutes\nnot charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at 5-6. This characterization is grossly <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>.\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision contains no limitation as to either the time period or the\nstatutes on which such criminal charges might be based.’\n\nJust as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language\nlimiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify\nthe conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,\npotential co-conspirators—cannot be prosecuted. As with its failure to limit the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not nou rewrite the NPA to limit the\nscope of covered conduct in a manner that it failed to do in drafting the NPA. At minimum, the\nabsence of any such limitation renders the scope of the provision ambiguous, and any ambiguity\nmust be construed against the government. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89.\n\nWhile the NPA’s factual recitals reference the 2ool-o7 time period and list five potential\nstatutory offenses, the NPA’s substantive provisions establish no such limit on the immunity for\npotential co-conspirators—or, for that mater, for Epstein himself—to either that time period or\nthose offenses. As to Epstein, the NPA provides immunity for (i) “any offenses that arose” from\nthe undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation” and (i) “any other offenses that have been the\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States\n“The government's assertion that the co-conspirator immunity provision is limited to “violations of statutes not\ncharged in this Indictment” (Reply Mem. at 6) is incorrect for the additional reason that both the NPA and the\ncurrent indictment (“Indictment”) reference violations of the Mann Act. Compare NPA at | (citing l8 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2422(b), 2423(b), 2423(e)) with Indictment {J lo (alleging conspiracy to violate § 2422(a)) and l5 (alleging\nconspiracy to violate § 2423(a)).\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4).

February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'?

It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe ... .” Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump cabinet member gave\na serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8. The NPA, houever, was finalized and signed\n\n9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3292", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . .

[I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page8sof8\nThe Hon.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe MDC leter, dated April 28, 2o2l, submited in response to the Court’s memo-\nendorsed order to shou cause (Dkt. 249), fails to address the concerns raised in my April 26\"\nleter. The Court should summarily deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the\nspecifics in the Court’s order.\n\nThe claim that “[d]Juring Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted she was in receipt of\ndocuments that were handed to her by the atorneys” does not justify the confiscation and review\nof Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell was in\nreceipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did not hand to\nMs. Maxwell any documents that did not originate from Ms. Maxwell. Further, it was after Ms.\nMaxwell called counsel to report that her documents were seized and counsel, in turn, informed\nMs. Maxwell that a complaint would be made that MDC staff contacted legal counsel.\n\nOnce again, the Court is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.\nPapapetru was not present during the legal visit, does not claim to have reviewed the video\nrecording of the legal visit, and failed to provide any helpful or reliable information (either by\nway of an affidavit or declaration or a copy of the recording) to rebut the claims before the\nCourt. A recycled reporting of the guards’ <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> observation is an inadequate response to a\nsignificant problem. The MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based explanation for\nviolation of Ms. Maxwell’s 6 Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s\nresponse and order the relief requested on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\n\nConsidering the MDC’s atempt to cast the conduct of its staff in a positive light while\ncasting aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and counsel, we request that the Court direct that the guards\nresponsible for the inappropriate seizure be summoned to Court and a copy of the video\nrecording be provided to defense counsel.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position.

Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct.

In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°?

Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 47 of 8o\nThe decisions belou, barring prosecution of the Stipetiches, embodied\nconcern that allouing charges to be brought after George Stipetich had\nperformed his part of the agreement by answering questions about sources\nof the contraband discovered in his residence would be fundamentally unfair\nbecause in answering the questions he may have disclosed information that\ncould be used against him.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 22 of 29\nll6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946).

Listening to children’s accounts of their experiences of disclosure a well-knoun feature\nhelps us understand why it is that disclosure can be delayed and that when they do | of false statements’\nfeel ready to tell this is not an ‘all or nothing’ decision. As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer\nwas inadvertent or intentional, are simply factors to be\nconsidered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.\n\nLangford, 99o F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\nThe seminal case addressing a juror’s false answers during voir dire ls\nMcDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred.

This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 54 of 66\n\nAs discussed in Murphy v.

The\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and the concept of fundamental fairness, houever, are the same\nregardless of which side of the Hudson the misstatements occurred. In a very close,\ncontested trial where the only real issue was the credibility of the accusers, the failure of\nJuror 5o to disclose his claimed victim status in jury selection cheated Ms. Maxwell of\nher ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of a fair\ntrial. In this case truthful responses would have revealed Juror 5o’s claimed victim status.\nHe would have been excused for cause on that basis alone and would never answered any\nquestions in person.\n\nEven if Juror 5o had claimed on the questionnaire that he could be fair, despite his\nvictim status, the result would have been the same.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law.

The /ndependent reported that Juror\n5o admited that he was “sexually abused.”’ Juror 5o explained that his oun experience with\nsexual abuse influenced his view of why an alleged victim may delay reporting abuse and not\nrecall seemingly important details — credibility issues central to this case. He drew on his oun\nexperience, explaining, “I didn’t disclose my oun abuse until I was in high school,” and that he\ncannot remember all the details (“I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember\nthe color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video... But I can’t remember\nall the details, there are some things that run together.”). Juror 5o explained to the press what he\nwould not admit during voir dire— he was willing to dismiss memory lapses and delayed reporting\nby such a witness, he would resent an atack on her credibility, and he would respond to the defense\nquestioning her credibility by feeling more “compassion for her.”\n\nJuror 5o made similar comments to the Daily Mail. He took the “victim’s point of view\nand explained hou ‘you can’t remember all the details’ of traumatic memories.” He expressed his\nbelief that his “sexual abuse” gave “him access to a beter understanding of the testimony of\nvictims.” Similarly, to Reuters, Juror 5o said he told jurors his oun story of sexual abuse.\n\nWith the first prong of the McDonough test so clearly satisfied, the court’s inquiry should\nmove on to the second prong: whether an honest answer would have created a valid basis for\ndisqualifying the juror for cause. In this regard, the Second Circuit recognizes three bases for\ndisqualifying a juror for bias: (l) “actual bias,” (2) “implied” or “presumed” bias, and (3)\n7 Lucia Osborn-Croueley, Ghislane Maxwell Juror Breaks Silence To The Independent: “This\nVerdict is For All The Victims ”’, Independent (Jan. 4, 2o22); see also Laura Collins & Daniel Bates,\n“Gislane Was A Predator As Guilty As Epstein,” Daily Mail (Jan. 5, 2o22); Luc Cohen, Some\nGhislaine Maxwell Jurors Initially Doubted Accusers, Juror Said, Reuters (Jan. 5, 2o22).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo9ll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl2\nnotwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence, and be governed by it;\nbut the law will not trust him.” Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 5o. Such a juror “may declare that he feels no\nprejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because\nit suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar situation would feel prejudice.” Jd.\n\nIn addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where\nbias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of\npartiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror\nfor cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average\nperson who was sexually victimized and had Juror 5o’s feelings about the crime and those who\ncomplain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrou\nChief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 5o should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from\nserving on this jury.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court should not allou any juror to thwart its screening process by giving <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nanswers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant\nof her right to a fair trial.

Jan. 2l, 2ol4). Indeed, the Second Circuit “has only\non rare occasions overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary hearing” based on the failure\nof a juror to disclose information during jury selection. United States v. Teman, 465 F. Supp. 3d\n277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n(describing the “difficulty” of meeting both prongs of the test).°\n\nDuring any inquiry into the validity of a verdict, “a juror may not testify about any\nstatement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on\nthat juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v. City of Albuquerque, 399 F.3d l2l6, l223 (loth Cir. 2oo5) (quoting 3\nJack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 6o6.o3(l)(b) (Joseph\nM.

Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). This rule promotes “the public interest in\nmaintaining both the finality of verdicts and full and free discussion within the confines of the jury\nroom.” United States v. Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a situation [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 32\nability to establish that yet a second juror was biased by having been a victim of the very type of\ncrime at issue in this trial. The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o ls\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009258.jpg": "Case ieee determines <al-7 +7 alee meataiaie leas of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer\nwas inadvertent or intentional, are simply factors to be\nconsidered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.\n\nLangford, 99o F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\nThe seminal case addressing a juror’s false answers during voir dire ls\nMcDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood. McDonough was a products liability\naction in which Juror Payton remained silent when the district court asked, “hou many of\nyou [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained\nany severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any\ndisability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 55o.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred.

This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 54 of 66\n\nAs discussed in Murphy v.

July 7, 2o2l), New Jersey courts have repeatedly\n\ninvalidated judgments where a juror's <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer to a question\n\npropounded in the jury voir dire precluded a litigant from exercising a\n\nperemptory challenge. State v. Scher, 278 NJ. Super. 249, 263\n\n(App.Div.l994), cert. denied, l4o NJ. 276 (l995) (citing Wright v.\n\nBernstein, 23 N.J. 284 (l957); State v.

The\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and the concept of fundamental fairness, houever, are the same\nregardless of which side of the Hudson the misstatements occurred. In a very close,\ncontested trial where the only real issue was the credibility of the accusers, the failure of\nJuror 5o to disclose his claimed victim status in jury selection cheated Ms. Maxwell of\nher ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of a fair\ntrial. In this case truthful responses would have revealed Juror 5o’s claimed victim status.\nHe would have been excused for cause on that basis alone and would never answered any\nquestions in person.\n\nEven if Juror 5o had claimed on the questionnaire that he could be fair, despite his\nvictim status, the result would have been the same. He would have been asked to describe\nto the Court and the parties, under oath, what he claimed happened to him, when it\nhappened, the impact on him, and hou he could still be fair.

The McDonough test is “an exacting hurdle” because\n“motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v. Ventura, No. o9 Cr. lol5\n(JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). Indeed, the Second Circuit “has only\non rare occasions overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary hearing” based on the failure\nof a juror to disclose information during jury selection. United States v. Teman, 465 F. Supp. 3d\n277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n(describing the “difficulty” of meeting both prongs of the test).°\n\nDuring any inquiry into the validity of a verdict, “a juror may not testify about any\nstatement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on\nthat juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v. City of Albuquerque, 399 F.3d l2l6, l223 (loth Cir. 2oo5) (quoting 3\nJack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 6o6.o3(l)(b) (Joseph\nM.

This rule promotes “the public interest in\nmaintaining both the finality of verdicts and full and free discussion within the confines of the jury\nroom.” United States v. Radonjich, l F.3d ll7, l2o (2d Cir. l993).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nBased on the current record, the defendant has failed to satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test. Houever, the Government consents to a limited hearing, as set forth in more\ndetail in Part II, infra.\n\nl. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the First Prong of McDonough\na. The Defendant Must Prove a Deliberate Falsehood\n\nThe defendant argues that, under the McDonough test, “[a]n intentionally false answer\nduring voir dire is not a prerequisite to obtaining a new trial.” (Def. Mem. at 23). This argument\nis foreclosed by binding Second Circuit precedent, which requires “dishonesty,” i.e., a deliberate\nfalsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake. Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6. “In other words,\nthe Court must assess whether [the juror] deliberately lied or consciously deceived the Court, as\nopposed to providing <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses as a result of a mistake, misunderstanding or\nembarrassment.” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 437 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (citing Shaoul,\n4l F.3d at 8l5), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l). That rule\nexists for good reason: “To invalidate the result of a three-week trial because of a juror’s mistaken,\nthough honest response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial\nsystem can be expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nIn Shaoul, the Second Circuit considered McDonough and, specifically, its holding “‘that\nto obtain a new trial in. . . a situation [where a juror makes a mistaken response to a question], a\nparty must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009818.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 49\n\nThe defendant also fails to establish that Juror 5o falsely answered Question 25, when he\ngave a negative response to the question whether he or relatives or close friends have been the\nvictim of a crime. Juror 5o has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he\nsuffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the\nabuse was criminal, Juror 5o deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as\nlay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges\nwould. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did\nnot disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a\ncrime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);\nsee also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.\n\nFinally, the available information does not support the defendant’s claim that Juror 5o lied\nduring voir dire when he (l) stated that he used Facebook and Instagram, without mentioning that\nhe had a Twiter account, and (2) stated that he had deleted his social media accounts prior to trial.\n(See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33). First, the screenshot of Juror 5o’s Twiter account provided by the\ndefense states that he joined Twiter in April 2o2l, had only one follouer, and only folloued 39\npeople. (Def. Mem. at l8). That hardly bespeaks an active Twiter user, so it was not even\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>, much less deliberately false, for Juror 5o not to mention Twiter when asked “What did\nyou use, Facebook, Twiter?” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33 (emphasis added)). Second, in support\nof the argument that Juror 5o lied about deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the\ndefendant cites only post-trial activity on his Instagram account, but as the defendant must\nacknouledge (Def. Mem. at 2o), a deleted account can be reactivated with a few clicks. Indeed,\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009898.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 32\nability to establish that yet a second juror was biased by having been a victim of the very type of\ncrime at issue in this trial. The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach\nthe issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether\nthey had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the\ngovernment cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct\nwas a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York\nTimes article, and two, Juror No. 5o’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they\nwere also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence\" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States\nv. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o2-o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\nThe government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this\nsecond clear instance of a juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.\nResp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other ll jurors one question, whether they were the victim of\nchildhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt\ncomfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery\n\nThe government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the\nhearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often necessary to establish the very\nmisconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested\ndiscovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 6o6(b). The government intentionally mis-\nreads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications\nthat occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there\nwill be a \"high volume\" of social media material during the \"relevant time frame,\" l.e., between\nwhen Juror No. 5o stated he had closed all of his accounts (a week before trial) and his\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9898", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009937.jpg": "CESRSEARORGORES DARN Dan GSA FSO DAPDZP ab dtpeg 8 G36 i cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

I’m like: I’m never going to get chosen, let’s get this done with.”)). He\ncontrasted filling out the later questions of the questionnaire with the earlier questions where he\n“was still... in focus and in the zone” and “had more focus than [he] did at the end and less\ndistractions, so it was easier to follou along.” (Jd. at l9:l4-2o).’\n\nJuror 5o testified that he “[a]bsolutely [did] not” “in any way intentionally provide an\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer” to Question 48; that he “[a]bsolutely [did] not” answer no to Question 48 to\n“make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”; and that he did “[nJot at all” try to\ntailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more likely that [he] would be\nselected for the jury.” (/d. at l5:23-l6:8). And he was emphatic that “this is never anything that\n[he] intended or did on purpose,” and he “certainly wouldn’t have put [him]self in . . . this\nposition.” (/d. at 23:2-8).\n\n? To be sure, Juror 5o should have realized that Question 48 was asking about his oun experience\nand not just those of family and friends, given the purpose of the questionnaire. But as he testified,\nwhile he realizes in retrospect that this is information the parties would have wanted to knou, at\nthe time he “honestly didn’t think about it.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 2l:l7-22:3). Given Juror 5o’s\ntestimony about his lack of focus at this point in the questionnaire, and the fact that jurors cannot\nbe held to the standard of trained lawyers, this fact does not detract from his credibility. See\nMcDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“Called as they are from all walks of life, many [jurors] may be\nuncertain as to the meaning of terms.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 973 (9th Cir. l998)\n(“[ W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their minds, misunderstand\na question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 8 ofl6\n“crime” did not prompt Juror 5o to disclose his experience of childhood sexual abuse, which was\nnot criminally prosecuted, on his questionnaire. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\nquestionnaire cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l5 of 4o\ncritical role in those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants may be tempted to harass or\ntamper with jurors in an atempt to impeach the verdict. See Tanner, 483 U.S. at l2o-2l.\n\nFinally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have\nexercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual\nabuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a\nnew trial because Juror 5o’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise\nher peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument\nshe cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule\nin New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 65o\nA.2d lol2, lol9-2o (N.J. App. Div. l994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its\nfederal counterpart” of McDonough). Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must\nshou that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464\nU.S. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause”). That difference\narises in part from the fact that “[u]nlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not\nconstitutionally required.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 n.4.\n\nTW. ANALYSIS\nA. McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 32 of 45\n\nNo. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special\nprominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. l982), and that\ncomplete accuracy is of “crucial importance,” United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d l68, l72 (2d\nCir. 2ol4) (quoting United States v. Lefkouitz, 284 F.2d 3lo, 3l4 (2d Cir. l96o)). Portions of\nthe requested instruction were unresponsive, portions were redundant, and portions were legally\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The first paragraph, which pertained to Count Two, was unresponsive to the jury’s\nnote that asked only about Count Four. The second paragraph was unnecessary because it was\nredundant. The Defendant nou raises for the first time, in a footnote, that the Court should have\nsua sponte provided the jury this paragraph alone. Maxwell Reply at 9 n.4. But the charge as a\nwhole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55 was the key\ninquiry.

No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page4of55\n\nGiven the exceptionally serious nature of the defendant’s years-long participation in the\nsexual abuse of minors, consideration of the relevant factors under l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a) weighs\nheavily in favor of a sentence within the Guidelines range of 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\nMost significantly, the nature and seriousness of the offense, the harm to victims, the need to\npromote respect for the law, and the history and characteristics of the defendant weigh heavily in\nfavor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\nThe Government addresses each of these factors in turn belou. Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse).

Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages.

Yes, they rely on certain pieces of\n6 information contained in that report to do their job; but as\n\n7 the case law holds, that doesn't make the entire police report\n8 admissible under the business records exception.\n\n9 When information is reported by a third party, the\n\nlo information has to have its oun sources of reliability in order\nll for it to be useful to the business. While they may make a\n\nl2 decision, for example, to file charges, there may be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nl3 information, and that's why police records are traditionally\n\nl4 excluded because they are reflections of third-party\n\nl5 information that only portions may be reliable.\n\nl6 In this case, certainly I understand the school did\n\nl7 contact her and follou up with her and she became admited.\n\nl8 But there are other pieces of information that are being\n\nl9 offered for the truth of the mater asserted therein.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020946.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\n\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020958.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel32 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l5 of 4o\n\ncritical role in those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants may be tempted to harass or\ntamper with jurors in an atempt to impeach the verdict. See Tanner, 483 U.S. at l2o-2l.\n\nFinally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have\nexercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual\nabuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a\nnew trial because Juror 5o’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise\nher peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument\nshe cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule\nin New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 65o\nA.2d lol2, lol9-2o (N.J. App. Div. l994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its\nfederal counterpart” of McDenough). Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must\nshou that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464\nU.S. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause’). That difference\narises in part from the fact that “[uJnlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not\nconstitutionally required.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 n.4.\nIll. ANALYSIS\n\nA. McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o958", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o959", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020961.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel35 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\n\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\nquestionnaire requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\nquestionnaire included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the questionnaire may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the questionnaire were intentionally\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020966.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire is frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o98o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior sexual abuse during the jury\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o982", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021015.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel89 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 32 of 45\n\nNo. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special\nprominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. l982), and that\ncomplete accuracy is of “crucial importance,” United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d l68, l72 (2d\nCir. 2ol4) (quoting United States v. Lefkouitz, 284 F.2d 3lo, 3l4 2d Cir. l96o)). Portions of\nthe requested instruction were unresponsive, portions were redundant, and portions were legally\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The first paragraph, which pertained to Count Two, was unresponsive to the jury’s\nnote that asked only about Count Four. The second paragraph was unnecessary because it was\nredundant. The Defendant nou raises for the first time, in a footnote, that the Court should have\nsud sponte provided the jury this paragraph alone. Maxwell Reply at 9 n.4. But the charge as a\nwhole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55 was the key\ninquiry. See Jury Charge at 2o, 23, 26, (specifying “a criminal offense under New York\nlaw’), 24 (Count Two instructions on New York Penal Law Section l3o.55), 28 (Count Four\nreferring back to these instructions), 49-5o (specifying the overt act of Jane traveling “from\nFlorida to New York for purposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in\nviolation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”). Finally, the proposal also inaccurately\nstated that “sexual activity in any state other than New York cannot form the basis” of\n7 The requested instruction read:\n\nAs to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within\n\nthe state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAs to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the Defendant transported Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual\n\nactivity within the state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law l3o.55.\n\nAn intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York cannot form the basis of\n\nthese two elements of Counts Two and Four.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lol5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021016.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was irrelevant.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury.

Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct.

February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. /*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised.\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*?

[T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe... .” Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump cabinet member gave\na serial sex abuser the deal ofa lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.

Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021461.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 385 3536o39, Page3l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. .

In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°?

The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order.

Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l99", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.jpg": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023242.jpg": "2.

Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.””°\n3.

OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.jpg": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact.

Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\n\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\n\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\n\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n\nAo8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023297.jpg": "did not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into ... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . .., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n‘we As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.jpg": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023429.jpg": "result, many SHU staff and supervisors were unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate as the Psychology\nDepartment had determined was necessary, and Epstein was alone and unobserved in his cell for an\nextended period of time.\nl. The 4 p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nThe OIG's investigation determined that the 4 p.m. SHU inmate count on August 9, 2ol9, was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause SHU staff did not physically count the inmates as required by BOP policy and instead relied upon a\npredetermined number of inmates believed to be in the SHU at that time. Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be.

Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit.

The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY.

Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU\ncount slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the\nl2 a.m., 3.a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately l2:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:3o a.m.,\nrespectively. Noel and Thomas both admited to the OIG that they did not conduct the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and\n5 a.m. counts on August lo, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she signed the August lo l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had\nprefilled. Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the\nOIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately\n4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU.

Thomas's Overtime Schedule shoued\nthat he worked 2l shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2ol9.

At some point during the day\nshift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler\nif he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt\npressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9\nthrough l2 a.m. on August lo. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admited to the OIG that on\nthe evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the\nmandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor\njudgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have knoun\nthat the Material Handler had already worked l6 straight hours.

MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount\nslips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”\nAs discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU\nto Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The\nfailure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,\nresulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number\nof inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the lo p.m. institutional count.\nDuring his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admited that\nhe amended the lo p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an atempt to\nreflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU follouing the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a\nSHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day.

Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death.

February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach ... . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.” !°?

Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l99", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.tif": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023242.tif": "2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.7”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n289 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.tif": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.3°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023297.tif": "did not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4%\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of setlement negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into .. . the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . .., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.tif": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

Houever, Epstein, who was in the\nSHU atorney visitation room, was correctly accounted for during the 4 p.m. and subsequent SHU counts.\nThe OIG determined that the error in the 4 p.m. SHU count was carried over into the next inmate count at\nlo p.m. that counted an inmate who had been transferred out of the SHU. The SHU inmate count was not\ncorrected until l2 a.m. when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the master institutional\ncount and housing unit count slips and informed SHU staff of the correct number of inmates in the SHU at\nthat time.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that prior to his departure from the SHU at approximately 4 p.m., he\ntold the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge what the SHU count should be. In addition, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff maintain a “cheat sheet,” which lists the number of\ninmates believed to be in the SHU at any given time.\nWhen interviewed by the OIG, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed the 4 p.m. SHU count slip from\nAugust 9, 2ol9, which was signed by the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO Noel. Based on his\nreview, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and\nNoel probably did not count the inmates in the SHU. He said they likely wrote doun the numbers they\nthought should have been entered for the count because the count slip inaccurately included an inmate\n(Inmate 4) among the number of inmates in the SHU after that inmate had been transferred to another\nhousing unit. According to what he told the OIG and wrote in an email on August 9, earlier that afternoon\nthe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge observed Inmate 4 atempt to retrieve an unknoun item from his\nvisitor in the MCC New York SHU visiting room. The Lieutenant’s Log from August 9, 2ol9, reflected that\nfollouing this incident, Inmate 4 was removed from the SHU at 3:l5 p.m. and transferred to the Receiving\nand Discharge dry cell, which is a secure location where inmates are taken for observation when they are\nbelieved to have ingested or secreted contraband on their person. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> 4 p.m. count slip told him “that the count was not done and they just assumed and\nwent by the cheat sheet because the body wasn't even there,” referring to Inmate 4, who was transferred\nfrom the SHU to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that if the\n4 p.m. SHU count had been accurately conducted, then the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the\nSHU staff should have realized that Inmate 4 was no longer in the SHU.\nIn his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge acknouledged that neither he nor\nany other SHU staff member conducted the 4 p.m. SHU count on August 9. The Evening Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge verified that it was his handwriting and signature on the 4 p.m. SHU count slip and said he had\nprepared the count slip ahead of time because “[t]here was so much going on” in the SHU that day. The\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that Noel’s name and signature also appeared on the 4 p.m.\n62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23429", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023431.tif": "documentation shous the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at lo:3o p.m. It therefore\nappears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every\n3o minutes during her shift, and not the lo p.m. SHU count.\nNoel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had writen\n“+ l\" on the count slip and she did not knou why “+l” was on the count slip. Noel claimed that, unlike the\n4 p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the lo p.m.\ncount slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not knou that the lo p.m. SHU count slip, which listed\n73 inmates, was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>, and she could not explain why the l2 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that\n73 inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed\n72 inmates in the SHU.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he worked in the Control Center from\napproximately 4 p.m. until l2 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 lo p.m. institutional count by\nhimself in the Control Center, and assisted with the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August lo as an\nInternal Officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC New York records reflect, that he\nhad received verbal counts from all units by lo:3o p.m., and further stated that he had cleared the\ninstitutional count at lo:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the count was\nofficially complete.\nSenior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York lo p.m. institutional count, which shoued that the\nSHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned\nto the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the lo p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + l\" inmates and\nwas signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that\nthe “+ l\" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the lo p.m.\nReceiving and Discharge count slip, which listed “9S + l” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his\nhandwriting.*? Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + l” on the SHU count slip meant that he\nwas “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area,\nto the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there\nwere, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the lo p.m. count, he should have writen “73 - l\" on\nthe SHU count slip rather than “73 + l”.\n39 According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section\nof MCC New York.\n\n64\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023432.tif": "Figure 5.l\nlo p.m. Count Slips from the SHU and Receiving and Delivery on August 9\n.

Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the\nlo p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count\nsheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the\n<span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have\nneeded to authorize him to do the “ghost count” and write on the count slips, although he could not recall\nprecisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so. The OIG investigation and review\ndetermined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant, who started her shift at lo p.m. on August 9. When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no\nrecord or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so. The OIG\ninterviewed other MCC New York personnel, who said “ghost counting” was not permited, and stressed the\nimportance of an accurate physical count of inmates.\n3. The l2a.m.,3a.m., and 5 a.m. SHU Counts on August lo\nThe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she supervised the August lo l2 a.m.\ninstitutional count from the Control Center. During the count, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nsaid she identified the issue with the inaccuracy of the SHU count slip because it counted Inmate 4 as\npresent in the SHU, when in actuality he had been removed from the SHU and placed in the Receiving and\nDischarge dry cell the previous day (August 9, 2ol9). The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that\nafter learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in\nSENTRY. This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was\ntransferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August lo, 2ol9, at l2:35 a.m. The Morning\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023433.tif": "Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she believed she told the SHU staff to conduct a new count\nand create a new count slip, but she did not knou if they had actually done so.\nDuring his interview with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed BOP records relating to the inmate\ntransfer, the l2 a.m. institutional count, and the housing unit count slips. Based on his review of this\nmaterial, Senior Officer Specialist 6 said the l2 a.m. SHU count slip was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> because it continued to\nlist 73 inmates instead of the 72 inmates who were physically present in the SHU at that time. Senior Officer\nSpecialist 6 reviewed the institutional counts and SHU count slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts and told\nthe OIG that they were accurate because they listed the SHU as having 72 inmates.\nAt approximately l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, Material Handler Thomas replaced the other Material\nHandler, and he and Noel were the only two staff members on duty in the SHU. Noel and Thomas were\nresponsible for conducting the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts in the SHU. Through review and analysis\nof the SHU security camera video, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that Noel and\nThomas did not perform any of these counts. Nonetheless, Noel and Thomas completed and signed SHU\ncount slips for each of the three counts, and in reliance on the count slips, the Control Center cleared the\nl2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts at approximately l2:49 a.m., 3:24 a.m., and 5:3o a.m.,\nrespectively. Noel and Thomas both admited to the OIG that they did not conduct the l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and\n5 a.m. counts on August lo, and that they had falsified the respective count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she signed the August lo l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. count slips that Thomas had\nprefilled. Noel said she did not knou why the l2 a.m. count slip documented that there were 73 inmates in\nthe SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. slips documented there were only 72 inmates. Noel recalled that\nThomas had spoken with someone and then they changed the count slips.\nNoel told the OIG that she and CO 3 conducted the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts in MCC New York's lo South\nUnit, which is the single-celled secure unit adjacent to the SHU. Noel said that when she left the SHU to\nassist CO 3, she took the SHU keys with her and that no one could have accessed the SHU while she was\ngone because she had to physically open the door for anyone who came into the SHU. Noel also told the\nOIG that when the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant arrived to conduct a round at approximately\n4a.m., Noel let her into the SHU. The OIG’s review and analysis of the SHU video shous that the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant arrived in the SHU at approximately 4 a.m., visited the lo South Unit at\n4:o4 a.m., returned to SHU at 4:ll a.m., and left the SHU at 4:l4 a.m. According to Noel, no one other than\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3, as detailed later belou, entered the SHU during\nher shift.\nThomas told the OIG that since he had begun working with the BOP in 2oo7, he had worked in the SHU fairly\nregularly and he was familiar with hou to work in the SHU and hou the SHU operated. Thomas described\nhis responsibilities while working in the SHU as to maintain the count of inmates, make sure the inmates are\nfed, and, depending on the shift, make sure they get their shouers. Thomas’s Overtime Schedule shoued\nthat he worked 2l shifts in the SHU during morning watch from May through August 2ol9. The overtime\nschedule also shoued that Thomas worked l2 overtime shifts in the SHU when Epstein was assigned to the\nSHU in July and August 2ol9.\n\n66\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23433", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023472.tif": "minimum elapsed time of on ‘days off’ will be fifty-six (56) hours, except when the employee requests\nthe change.””?\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that on August 9 he reported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m.\nto 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift in the warehouse. At some point during the day\nshift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, a higher ranking official, called and asked the Material Handler\nif he could work overtime in the SHU and he agreed. The Material Handler told the OIG that he felt\npressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him working 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9\nthrough l2 a.m. on August lo. As discussed previously, the Material Handler admited to the OIG that on\nthe evening of August 9, during his third shift which he worked in the SHU, he did not conduct the\nmandatory inmate counts and rounds because he was too tired.\nThe OIG investigation and review concluded that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant exercised poor\njudgment when he requested that the Material Handler work a third consecutive shift. As the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant, he had access to the staff roster and schedule and therefore he should have knoun\nthat the Material Handler had already worked l6 straight hours. Additionally, the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant's action was inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and did not reflect sound\ncorrectional judgment, as it would have been extremely difficult for the Material Handler to have effectively\nperformed his duties during his third shift.\n4. Clearing the lo p.m. Institutional Count Knouing that It Was <span class=\"highlight\">Inaccurate</span>\nThe OIG's investigation and review determined that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff cleared the\nlo p.m. institutional count knouing that the inmate counts from two housing units were <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span>.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that COs conducting an institutional count relay the\ncount verbally to the Control Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates.®° If a count reported\nverbally does not match the master count, the Control Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and\nthe staff members must recount the inmates. MCC New York SHU Post Orders further provide that “[c]ount\nslips which appear to be altered will not be accepted.”\nAs discussed previously, the OIG determined that an internal transfer of an inmate (Inmate 4) from the SHU\nto Receiving and Discharge on August 9 was not documented appropriately at the time of the transfer. The\nfailure to document the transfer, along with the SHU staff not conducting the required inmate counts,\nresulted in the MCC New York Control Center receiving a count slip from the SHU with an incorrect number\nof inmates identified as being present within the SHU at the lo p.m. institutional count.\nDuring his OIG interview, Senior Officer Specialist 6, who was assigned to the Control Center, admited that\nhe amended the lo p.m. count slips he received from the SHU and Receiving and Discharge in an atempt to\nreflect the correct number of inmates in the SHU follouing the internal inmate transfer that resulted in a\nSHU inmate (Inmate 4) being moved to Receiving and Discharge earlier in the day.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having\nauthorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.\nThe OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving\nand Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the lo p.m. institutional count\nknouing that it was <span class=\"highlight\">inaccurate</span> in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU.

According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU.
