Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 239\ndefendant, in 2oo3, Congress wanted to ensure that every perpetrator who abused a minor in the\nfuture was subject to prosecution for the lifetime of the minor, but Congress simultaneously was\ncontent to let all previous perpetrators avoid prosecution whenever their victims turned twenty-\nfive. No such intent is manifest in either the text or in Senator Leahy’s statement.\n\nThe reach of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute\nof limitations to pre-enactment conduct, the Court should resolve its analysis at Landgraf step one\nand apply the statute as Congress intended. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—at worst—\nambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that view, it should proceed to Landgraf step two.\n\n2s The 2oo3 Amendment Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf\n\nIf the Court were to determine that the legislative intent behind Section 3283 is ambiguous,\nthe inquiry then extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which examines the\nretroactive effects of the statute. As the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute does\nnot operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating\nthe statute’s enactment, or upsets <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span> based in prior law.” 5ll U.S. at 269. Instead, the\nquestion is whether the statute “would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a\nparty’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already\ncompleted.” Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995)\n(quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o). Applying Section 3283 here would have none of those\neffects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were governed by the substantive criminal statutes\ngoverning her conduct. Until the statute of limitations expired, Maxwell had the same legal\nliability, the same rights, and the same incentives to retain evidence. A statute extending that\nperiod ataches no new legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the\nstatute does not operate “retrospectively” within the meaning of Landgraf.

We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law.

Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case.

Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case.

The privacy concerns that favor limiting access to the\nJury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript by others do not apply to Juror 5o himself, given his\nunique involvement and personal role in the inquiry directed by the order of this Court. As such,\nthe balancing of the relevant factors strongly supports granting Juror 5o access to his oun Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of his voir dire testimony, under seal, especially in light of the\nunique facts and circumstance presented by this mater.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above stated reasons, Juror 5o respectfully requests the Court release a copy of\nthe Jury Questionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire testimony to the Prosecution,\ndefense counsel, and the atorney for Juror 5o, under seal, and that the Court grant his motion to\nintervene.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo899o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009461.jpg": "Case D2oen8oB38R PAscUNBoc manent tel6622 o lRildd) 82l24) 2P agPidgef4B of ll7\nA-5857\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page l5 of 29\n- .

(/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span> about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span> are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span> that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document696- Filed o6/29/22 Page5of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3A — Supervised Release\nJudgment—Page a a of oO.\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSTANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\n\nAs part of your supervised release, you must comply with the follouing standard conditions of supervision.

Feldman, announced that the Program has awarded nearly $l25 million\nto approximately l5o eligible claimants and has concluded its claimant-facing operations, roughly one year\nafter the Program launched on June 25, 2o2o. Ninety-two percent (92%) of eligible claimants accepted their\ncompensation offers, and the Program paid over $l2l million to those claimants.\nThe number of claims submited to the Program — approximately 225 — far exceeded original <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span>\nthat loo claims would be filed. Claims were generally processed and paid within 6o to 9o days, which\nincluded the review of the claim, a meeting with the Administrator, and issuance of the determination, and\nalloued for a 6o-day response period for claimants to fully consider the offer.\n“This important, independent Program alloued victims/survivors who were sexually abused by Jeffrey\nEpstein to resolve their claims outside of court through a voluntary, confidential, fair, empathetic and\nexpeditious process — beyond the glare of public proceedings and without the costs and confrontation of\nlitigation. Every claimant had an opportunity to be heard in a safe space, to share the intimate, personal,\noften harrouing accounts of what they endured and hou it has affected them,” Ms. Feldman said. “I was\ncontinually struck by the resilience and courage of the victims who put their faith and trust in this process.”\nConsistent with the governing Protocol, Ms. Feldman administered the Program independently of and\nentirely free from any interference or control by the Epstein Estate. Ms. Feldman had complete autonomy\nand decision-making authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation, and evaluated\neach claim on its merits without reference to any individual or aggregate cap on compensation amounts.\nPreserving claimant privacy and treating victims with compassion and sensitivity was critical to the success\nof the Program. “Confidentiality served as a cornerstone of the Program, allouing victims who otherwise\nmay have been reluctant to come forward to participate without fear of public exposure,” Ms. Feldman said.\n“Given the history of the Epstein case, we were also particularly mindful of the importance of providing\nclaimants transparency into the claims process and offering them an opportunity to tell their stories. Every\ndecision made and every action taken was rooted in these guiding principles,” Ms. Feldman added.\n“T am proud of what we were able to accomplish with this Program, but also recognize that no amount of\nmoney will erase the years of pain these victims have endured because of Jeffrey Epstein. My hope is that\nthe Program provided his victims a meaningful measure of justice and a step on the path touard healing.”\nFor information about the Program, visit htps://www.epsteinvcp.com.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012178.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l58 of 264 569\nLClVMAX5 Jane -— cross\n\nl the question is, Are you aware that your atorney made a\n\n2 statement to the government about his conversation with you\n\n3 about your expected outcome in the case.\n\n4 THE COURT: Well, okay.

See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n498 (l998).

In Vernon v.\nCassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist. 49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), a civil case, the\nCourt concluded that an amendment to a statute of limitations applied retroactively\nbecause it was procedural. id. at 89l, But in Enterprise, Judge Cabranes—writing\nfor a unanimous Court—retreated altogether from Vernon’s prior characterization\nof statutes of limitations as purely “procedural.” As Judge Cabranes wrote, Vernon\n“did not create a categorical exception [for statutes of limitations] from Landgraf’s\npresumption against retroactive application of legislation.” 39l F.3d at 4o9.

Because Congress has expressly extended the\nstatute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, Judge\nNathan correctly resolved this analysis at Landgraf\nstep one. In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets <span class=\"highlight\">expectations</span>\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023832.jpg": "Re: Media inquiry - NYl - re: Epstein hearing tomorrou\n\nFrom Lee Plourde\n\nTo PELE\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/3o l5:36\n\nSubject: Re: Media inquiry - NYl - re: Epstein hearing\n\ntomorrou\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nThank you.\nSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: SEES bop.gov>\nDate: 7/3o/l9 3:2o PM (GMT-o5:oo)\nTo: PEO @ bop.gov>, Lee Plourde {9GQ@bop.gov>\nSubject: Re: Media inquiry - NYl - re: Epstein hearing tomorrou\n> > >| O OIG o7/3o/2ol9 l5:2o >>>\nFYI - Nancy Ayers is having me send this response to this reporter (in case you get similar inquiries):\nReporter:\nQuestion:\nI hope this email finds you well.
