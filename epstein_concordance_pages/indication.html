Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell\nprovides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of what many of these potential\nwitnesses might have testified to. The testimony she\nsuggests the detective might have offered—that\nwitnesses in the Palm Beach investigation did not\nidentify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence\nthat does nothing to establish her innocence of the\ncharged offenses. There are also serious doubts under\nall of the relevant circumstances that a jury would\nhave found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and\ntestified on her behalf. See United States v.

That contention is incorrect,\nand petitioner does not shou that it would succeed in\nany court of appeals.

This Court has previously\ndenied certiorari in a case raising a similar claim. See\nPrisco v. United States, 562 U.S. l29o (2oll) (No. lo-\n7895). It should follou the same course here.\n\nl. The court of appeals correctly held that Epstein’s\nNPA did not bar petitioner’s prosecution. Pet. App. 8a-\nl2a.\n\na. Petitioner asserts (Pet. l) that prosecution for one\nof her three counts of conviction was barred by a provision\nof Epstein’s NPA stating, in relevant part, that “the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo23o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000233.jpg": "lo\ndid not take on some unique broader meaning in the co-\nconspirators’ clause. Cf. Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gar-\nner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\nl7o-l73 (2ol2) (presumption of consistent usage).\n\nMoreover, even if the meaning of the coconspirators\nclause were not clear in context, extrinsic evidence\nwould resolve the ambiguity against petitioner. See\nUnited States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 55l (3d Cir. 2oo2).\nAt the time the NPA was negotiated, DOJ policy barred\nUSAOs from entering into NPAs that bound other dis-\ntricts unless they obtained the approval of those dis-\ntricts or the Criminal Division. Pet. App. loa. That pol-\nicy reflects the longstanding general rule that a U.S. At-\ntorney’s area of responsibility is limited to “his district.”\n28 U.S.C. 547; see Pet. App. lla-l2a. While petitioner\nsuggests (Pet. l8) that USAOs are instructed to be ex-\nplicit on that point, they are also instructed to consult\nwith other DOJ components if they intend to altogether\nforeclose any prosecution by other USAOs. See Justice\nManual § 9-27.63o. And there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> here that\nanyone involved in negotiating Epstein’s NPA obtained\nthe necessary approval for binding other USAOs or\nthought it was necessary. Pet. App. loa.\n\nb. Petitioner’s contrary arguments (Pet. l2-l8) lack\nmerit. She invokes general principles that prosecutors\nshould be held to the promises they make, see Pet. l3-\nl4 (discussing Santobello, supra, and Giglio v. United\nStates, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972)), and that “ambiguities in a\nplea agreement are to be resolved against the govern-\nment,” Pet. l6. But those arguments merely beg the\nquestions of what promises the NPA did make and\nwhether the NPA is ambiguous. As explained above,\nthe NPA’s coconspirators clause, read in context, is not\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000235.jpg": "l2\n(the USAO) and the corresponding geographic limita-\ntions of that agreement, as reflected in its promises re-\ngarding the prosecution of Epstein himself.\n\nPetitioner’s remaining arguments are likewise mis-\nplaced. Her effort (Pet. l5-l6) to link the coconspira-\ntors clause with other NPA provisions addressing\npotential civil suits under l8 U.S.C. 2255 (2oo6) is self-\ndefeating, since the later provisions reinforce the\nNPA’s limitation to the Southern District of Florida.\nSee Pet. App. 28a (providing that “Epstein will not con-\ntest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Florida” in such suits). Sim-\nilarly unavailing is petitioner’s emphasis (Pet. l7) on\nlanguage in one draft of the NPA that would have ex-\npressly limited the coconspirators’ protection to the\nSouthern District of Florida. See Pet. App. ll7a. There\nis no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that anyone involved in drafting the\nNPA understood the different versions of the cocon-\nspirators clause to have different geographic scopes.\nSee id. at l22a-l23a; see also id. at l25a n.l25 (former\nFirst Assistant U.S. Atorney telling DOJ investigators\nthat “the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other\nco-conspirators could have been prosecuted ‘by any\nother U.S. Atorney’s office in the country’”) (brackets\nomited). As the district court explained, an NPA “need\nnot painstakingly spell out ‘the Office of the United\nStates Atorney for Such-and-Such District’ in every in-\nstance to make clear that it applies only in the district\nwhere signed.” Jd. at 56a-57a.\n\nAt all events, the case-specific interpretation of a\nparticular NPA is not a mater that warrants this\nCourt’s review. See Sup. Ct. R. lo. And that is especially\ntrue where “district court and court of appeals are in\nagreement as to what conclusion the record requires.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F.

The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.?

What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l).

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Indeed, it appears\nfrom the FBI Florida Office’s file that the FBI Florida Office contacted numerous other FBI\noffices, including offices in New Mexico, Australia, and Colombia, to seek similar assistance.\nThose other FBI offices similarly had no apparent involvement in the case beyond assisting in\ncontacting and interviewing witnesses in their regions. Providing such ancillary assistance does\nnot convert an FBI field office into a member of a prosecution team. See, e.g., United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (no joint investigation between U.S.\nAtorney’s Office and SEC where the two entities conducted a small number of joint interviews\nand engaged in limited sharing of information with each other).\n\nRegardless, the Government has identified and produced additional materials to the defense\nreflecting interactions between the FBI New York Office and the FBI Florida Office during the\nFlorida Investigation. Although the Government does not believe that these materials are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l97 Filed o4/o7/2l Page 4of5\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Even a Federal Express envelope from the government\nwas not given to Ms. Maxwell until two weeks after it was sent, containing a discovery disc that\nwas unreadable. In mid-March, she received a copy of the New York Times issued in October.\nAny claim that Ms. Maxwell deletes CorrLinks emails, which is disputed, does litle to erase the\nfact that the MDC violated its oun policy by prematurely deleting Ms. Maxwell’s legal emails.\nThat her food is not heated in a thermal oven does litle to explain why she was given a salad\ncontaining mold earlier this week.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not have an eye mask; she’s not even provided a suitable face mask.\nShe covers her eyes with a touel to shield them from glaring overhead lighting that she cannot\nturn off and from flashlights pointed into her cell every l5 minutes during the night. That Ms.\nMaxwell chooses not to respond to guards during the nightime is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that she is\nengaged in restful sleep; rather, it’s a respite from having to engage with them.\n\nNo amount of gloss put on Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement can erase the fact\nthat she remains in de facto solitary confinement, over-managed by multiple guards, and\nsurveilled by multiple cameras 24 hours per day. The computer equipment provided remains\ninadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery under circumstances that are not\nconducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to believe that not being able to search, mark,\nsave, and print is sufficient to prepare this document-laden case for trial. The Court need only\nimagine hou the government would respond if this was a 25-year-old document-driven fraud\ncase.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002965.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 239\noffer any evidence to support her claim that the NPA applies to this District, to the defendant, or\nto the crimes in the Indictment, the Court should deny the defendant’s request for discovery and\nan evidentiary hearing.\n\nA. The NPA Does Not Bind the Southern District of New York\n\nAs an initial mater, the NPA is not enforceable in this District. To the contrary, it is black-\nleter law in this Circuit that a plea agreement in one district does not apply elsewhere, in the\nabsence of express indications not present here. Indeed, the Second Circuit has considered and\nrejected the exact arguments the defendant advances in her motion. The defendant’s motion is\nwithout any basis in the law and should be denied.\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A\nplea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea\nis entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”’));\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998). This Circuit “presumes a narrou\nreading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a\nmore expansive interpretation was contemplated.” United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 854\n(E.D.N.Y. l988) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672), aff'd, 867 F.2d l425 (2d Cir. l988)(tbl.). To\nmeet this burden, a defendant must establish that either the text of the agreement or the\n“negotiations between defendant and prosecutor” indicate a promise to bind other districts. United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant\nhas failed to establish that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the NPA would bind other\ndistricts.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2965", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 239\nnot parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes\na narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively\nestablish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”’) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at\n672). To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002970.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 36 of 239\nprosecutions by those two offices, and only those two offices.4 The defendant therefore cannot\nargue that the word “global” in this provision means that the NPA binds the entire federal\ngovernment.\n\nIn sum, the defendant points to nothing in the text of the NPA that could possibly be\nconstrued to bind other districts. To the contrary, there are affirmative indications in the text that\nthe NPA applies only to the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under Annabi, the NPA is only binding\non the USAO-SDFL, and the defendant’s motion fails as a mater of law.\n\nZ. The Defendant Has Offered No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other\nDistricts\n\nAlthough a defendant may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosecutor and\ndefendant contained a promise to bind other districts, Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626, the defendant has\nfailed to do so here. The defendant’s motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory\nallegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.\n\nThe lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by\nthe USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein’s victims. (Def. Mot. | at 22). The\nlog reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other\nstates—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since\nfederal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any\nway establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investigation, let alone\nthat the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the U.S. Atorney’s offices in those states would be\nbound by the NPA.\n\n* Interpreting the term “federal liability” in this provision could not be read to encompass all U.S.\nAtorney’s offices without also interpreting its neighboring term, “state . . . liability,” to refer to\nevery state prosecutor’s office in all fifty states. The USAO-SDFL clearly did not—and could\nnot—make such a broad promise.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo297o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002971.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 239\n\nThe privilege log also does not establish that the USAO-SDFL involved other U.S.\nAtorney’s Offices in plea negotiations with Epstein. Grasping at straws, the defendant points to\na notation in the privilege log, which contains an entry for handwriten notes, reflecting that the\nprosecutor in the USAO-SDFL spoke with an Assistant U.S. Atorney in New York. (Def. Mot. l\nat 22). The notes referenced in the privilege log are atached hereto as Exhibit l. As the notes\nreflect, the prosecutor at the USAO-SDFL reached out to an Assistant U.S. Atorney at the USAO-\nSDNY to ask about a civil lawsuit relating to Epstein that was handled by the Civil Division of\nthis Office in the l99os. The Government is producing to defense counsel today emails that\nconfirm that this was the nature of the contact.*> One of those emails is atached hereto as Exhibit\n2 for the Court’s reference. Put simply, those communications provide no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the\nUSAO-SDNY was involved in plea negotiations with Epstein. Rather, the USAO-SDFL asked\nabout an old civil case involving Epstein that an AUSA at the USAO-SDNY happened to handle\nyears earlier. In sum, the privilege log in no way establishes that other districts were involved in\nnegotiating the NPA, much less that Epstein was promised that the NPA would bind other districts.\n\nThe defendant proffers no other documentary evidence beyond the privilege log. Instead,\nwithout any citation, she broadly alleges that “senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved\nin the negotiation and approval of the NPA.” (Def. Mot. l. at 22). This vague and unsworn\nallegation is not evidence. Moreover, any contacts between the USAO-SDFL and Main Justice\n> In response to the allegations raised by the defense’s motion, the Government identified the\nunderlying notes referenced in the privilege log. The Government is producing those underlying\nnotes, as well as the relevant emails, to defense counsel today. The Government has also been\ninformed by a human resources representative that payroll records reflect that the Assistant U.S.\nAtorney referenced in the privilege log left the USAO-SDNY on or about April 29, 2oo7, months\nbefore the NPA was executed. Although the Government has been informed that Human\nResources records do not contain information regarding a division transfer, the Government\nunderstands from colleagues that the Assistant U.S. Atorney worked in the Civil Division in the\nl99os and worked in the Criminal Division in the 2ooos.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo297l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 239\nbroad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a\nsexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2ol4 WL l838255, at *ll, but\ninstead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.\nSee Sensi, 2olo WL 235l484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to\nencompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse\neven when found in chapters llo (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and ll7\n(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title l8”); Schneider, 8ol F.3d\nat l96-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose\nof engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2ol4 WL\nl838255, at *ll-l2 (holding that violations of l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual\nabuse under Section 3283).\n\nThe defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4). But Bridges is inapposite,\nsince it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its\nconservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations\nonly as to” certain narrouly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive\nlanguage or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to\nlimit its application to a specific subset of circumstances. Congress,\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2999", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v.

Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. A question is “fundamentally ambiguous” when “it is not a phrase with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual\nunderstanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and\noffered as testimony.” /d. at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). In such a case, the “answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Lighte, 782\nF.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v. Sarwari, 669 F.3d 4ol, 4o7 (4th Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.\nFarmer, l37 F.3d l265, l269 (loth Cir. l998)). A defendant cannot demonstrate fundamental\nambiguity simply by shouing that words used in a question are amenable to multiple meanings,\nor that an answer “might generate a number of different interpretations.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375;\nUnited States v. Strohm, 67l F.3d ll73, ll78 (loth Cir. 2oll) (“Simply plumbing a question for\npost hoc ambiguity will not defeat a perjury conviction where the evidence demonstrates the\ndefendant understood the question in context and gave a knouingly false answer.”). “If, in the\n“” The Second Circuit analyzes general principles of perjury similarly under l8 U.S.C. § l623 and\nanother perjury statute, l8 U.S.C. § l62l, see Lighte, 782 F.3d at 372, and it has assumed without\ndeciding that those standards also apply to offenses under l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(2), see United States\nv.

Similarly, “where an indictment charges a\ncrime that depends in turn on violation of another statute, the indictment must identify the\nunderlying offense.” United States v. Pirro, 2l2 F.3d 86, 93 (2d Cir. 2ooo). When delineating the\ncontours of this narrou category of crimes requiring additional specificity in an indictment, the\nSecond Circuit has previously found that the failure to name a specific victim of fraud does not\nrender an indictment inadequate under this standard. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l27. In other words,\nabsent some affirmative <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that additional specificity is required when charging a particular\nstatute, there is no basis to conclude that an indictment need contain more than the elements of the\noffense and the approximate time and place of the alleged violation.

Discussion\n\nBecause each of the four counts at issue—Counts One, Two, Three, and Four—clearly lays\nout each element of the charged offense and adequately informs the defendant of the accusations\nagainst her, the Indictment easily satisfies the standard for sufficiency. Tellingly, the defendant\ndoes not claim that any of these counts fails to allege an essential element or to track the language\nof the relevant statute.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct.

Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3472", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*” Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43 l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3692", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel3 of 23\nNew York Mellon Trust Co., 82l F.3d at 3o9; Collins, 929 F.3d at 84l; Penncro Assocs., 499\nF.3d at ll56-57.

One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 297 of 349\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 298 of 349\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v.

Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document375 Filed lo/27/2l Pagelof2\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 * Fax besternheim@mac.com\n\nOctober 27, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

STERNHEIAA\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of\ncognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with\ndynamic atentional control.” 4\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 23 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations IT\nfocused and suggestive questions may elicit both agreement with inter-\nviewer assumptions and confabulations, thereby decreasing the accuracy\nof responses (Cederborg & Lamb, 2oo8; Clare & Gudjonsson, l993; Joyce,\n2oo3; Kebbel & Haton, l999; Kebbel, Haton, & Johnson, 2oo4). Partly\nbecause of these vulnerabilities, there is a disproportionately high rate\nof false confessions in ID populations compared to the average popula-\ntion, and this is believed to be associated with (a) misunderstanding the\npotential consequences of a false confession and (b) the use of interrogative\ntechniques that elicit compliance with the interrogator (Kassin et al., 2olo).\nIt is, therefore, a concern that individuals with ID may be prone to provid-\ning positive response sets, changing their account of events in response to\nleading questions, and having misunderstandings about the legal process.\n\nTherefore, a heightened potential for suggestibility and acquiescence in\nindividuals with ID may be relevant in cases of false allegations of sexual\nassault in which (a) the alleged victim did not initiate the complaint and\nis consequently questioned in a manner that elicits positive responses and\nconfabulation or (b) suspicion of sexual abuse was conveyed to the vic-\ntim in a suggestive way by an individual or group that would potentially\nbenefit from an allegation by proxy. In the first case, the individual who\ninitiates the false complaint may have suspicions about sexual abuse related\nto perceived indications that a sexual assault occurred (e.g., a change in the\ndisabled person’s sexual behavior, signs that a sexual relationship may be\noccurring). In the second case, care providers who serve to benefit from fil-\ning a false allegation—perhaps traceable to another psychological pathway\nfor filing a false allegation—might take advantage of the suggestible and\nacquiescent nature of an individual with ID. In either case, the individual\nwith ID is at a higher risk of submiting a false allegation in these situations\nthan individuals without ID because of this population’s greater tendency\ntouard suggestibility and acquiescence.\n\nIn a false allegation of sexual assault, shifts in the reporting of core\nfeatures of the sexual assault (e.g., the general location, features of the\nassault) may indicate that the methods of questioning were suggestive or\nthat the alleged victim is confabulating. Furthermore, the involvement of\na litigation-minded advocate of the alleged victim who has the potential\nto gain from his or her association with the case might warrant a further\ninvestigation into the motives and actions of this individual. If evidence sug-\ngests that the origin of the false allegation is related to high suggestibility\nor acquiescence and thus a false belief that a sexual assault occurred, sug-\ngestibility may be assessed by examining the alleged victim’s response sets\nfor significantly high levels of agreement with the interviewer and paterns of\ninconsistent responses emerging after suggestive questioning. Additionally,\nthe Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS; Gudjonsson, l984) has shoun to\nbe a reliable and valid (Merckelbach et al., l998) measure of suggestibil-\nity and may be employed as an adjunctive measure of susceptibility to\nsuggestive questioning.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo629l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006306.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9Qof:\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

Nathan\nJanuary 5, 2o22\nPage 2\nC(iS\n\nRespectfully, it is not the proper function of the Court to contact the Juror and suggest\nthat he retain an atorney or to secure the appointment of an atorney on his behalf. There is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> this Juror either needs a lawyer or is indigent and qualifies for court-appointed\ncounsel. Moreover, any such action would undermine the search for the truth and thus potentially\ncompromise Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell intends to request a new trial under Rule 33 because the “interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). Any submission will include all knoun undisputed remarks\nof the Juror, including recorded statements, the relevant questionnaire, and other non-\ncontroverted facts. It is clear to Ms. Maxwell that based on this record alone a new trial is\nrequired. If this Court disagrees, houever, Ms. Maxwell requests that a hearing be scheduled\n\n' The government cites United States v. Langford in support of its request for a hearing.\nDoc. 568, p 2. But the hearing in Langford concerned whether an honest answer from the juror\nwould have subjected her to a challenge for cause due to bias, i.e., the second prong of the\nMcDonough multi-part test. 9oo F.2d at 68-69. Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving controlled substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains discretion to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the discretion of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary. In that case,\nthe district court struck a juror for cause where she had engaged in the structuring of cash deposits,\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009183.jpg": "l/26/22, 3:3oPM Case l:2o-cr-Oo@MakihtexwellD @ceays evitefich Deminced kad she WAd A2predatdr ADpay Ma fOntihe\nSEMENT Maxwell faced six counts relating to sex trafficking signed an earlier £37o,ooo ($5oo,ooo) legal setlement\nwhich centered on the stories of four victims. with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the duke's friend.\nA fifth victim, Kate, was called only to shou a patern of Pale Raberts, a6, ene af the bllkernsatn Sex alfensier .\ning behavi d di ly imoli dj most high-profile victims, claims she was trafficked by\nOreeming Denaviet ana WEE-NS!

To merit dismissal a\ndefendant must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.” United\n’ The defendant also reasserts that the witnesses “already mentioned in [her] previous filings”—\nnamely, Jeffrey Epstein, Epstein’s mother, Michael Casey (the alleged agent of Minor Victim-l),\nand Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarey—‘could have provided evidence\ncontradicting the government’s proof.” (Def. Mot. at 29). The Court already rejected the\ndefendant’s claims of actual prejudice as to these witnesses, finding that the defendant “provide[d]\nno <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to” and noting “serious\ndoubts under all of the relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein\ncredible even if he had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf.”\n(Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8). The defendant offers no new arguments as to these witnesses, and her claims\ncertainly fare no beter after the trial in this mater.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors.

Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3l of 49\ni. Inferred Bias\n\nWhile the category of cases in which bias must be implied or presumed is limited to\n“exceptional” or “extreme situations,” the district court retains discretion to dismiss a juror for\ncause when “a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to\nwarrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is\n“closely linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of inferred\nbias is permited “‘only after having received responses from the juror that permit an inference that\nthe juror in question would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Jd. at 47. “[A] finding\nof inferred bias is, by definition, within the discretion of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\nAnd, as with actual bias, “a district court’s evaluation of the juror’s impartiality is accorded\ndeference.” /d.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined\nto disturb a trial judge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for\ncause in the empanelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v. Ploof, 464 F.2d ll6, ll8-l9 n.4 (2d\nCir. l972))).\n\nHere, the record refutes any suggestion that, had Juror 5o disclosed a history of sexual\nabuse, the Court would have struck him based on a finding of inferred bias. As set forth above,\nthe record is clear that the Court would have in fact conducted targeted follou-up questioning and,\nabsent some <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in such questioning that would have permited an inference of bias, the\nCourt would not have struck him. See Torres, l28 F.3d at 47 (finding of inferable bias “must be\ngrounded in facts developed at voir dire’).\n\nTorres, upon which the defendant exclusively relies, is not to the contrary.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll—l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” /d. at 4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial.

In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of two distinct conspiracies. Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial.

See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o. Accordingly, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span>\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l6 (quoting\nUnited States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 75l (2d Cir. l999)).

Discussion\n\nA. The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n? See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny.

Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case.

The Government has received five submissions, which\nare enclosed.

Leter dated August 5, 2o25, and signed by Neil S. Binder, Esq.: Counsel provided two\nversions of the leter—one for filing under seal and the other with redactions for public\n\n’ filing.\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 23 of 3l\n\nFirst, as the Second Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly relevant\nbecause it reflects whether there is an ongoing need for grand jury secrecy. See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for disclosure, that should serve as a\npreliminary <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial. See note l6,\nsupra,\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 26 of 3l\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v.

Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v.

Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020815.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel97 of 2o8\nno <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v.

Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020833.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page? of 22l\n3l26\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl mind of their oun.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o959", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised.

The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\nquestionnaire is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll-l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\nquestionnaire session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the questionnaire because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” Jd. at4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial.

The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28.

Cf’ Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l.

This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial.

Accordingly, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span>\nin the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”\nbecause it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.\nMaxwell Br. at l8. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the\nCourt’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury\nimproperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the\nDefendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction\nfollouing the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting\ninstructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been\ninstructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially\nconfusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear\nto the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act\ncounts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shoun that she suffered\n“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.\n\nIV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.\n\nLast, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions\nshould be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in\nprosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of\nlimitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the\nDefendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test.

The “potential co-\nconspirators” provision binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the\ncanon of construction enunciated in United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985), that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney\nfor the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is inapplicable here. Jd. at 672.\nBut even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should\nnot apply here because (l) the NPA originated in a district outside this circuit with\ndifferent rules that should control; (2) Annabi applies only if the new charges are\nsufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where there is no\naffirmative <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the agreement was intended to bind other districts and\nthere were affirmative indications here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for\nambiguous agreements which should be used only after an evidentiary hearing\ndetermines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery or a\nhearing on this issue.\n\n2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute of\nlimitations for violations of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because the\n“sexual or physical abuse...of a child” is not a necessary element of those offenses.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021086.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page39 of ll3\nprecedent may have been doctrinally flawed, expanding it into “new...context[s]”\nwould be “a disfavored judicial activity’) (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, l37 S. Ct.\nl843, l857, l859 (2ol7)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\nterritory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges\nare “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.\nId. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct\nfrom 2ool through 2oo4 that falls entirely within the 2ool-2oo7 offense period\ncontemplated by the NPA. Therefore, Annabi is inapplicable at least as to Count\nSix.\n\nThird, Annabi and its predecessors involved situations where there was no\n“affirmative” <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021095.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page48 of ll3\nother offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury\ninvestigation.” Al44. Consequently, the charge is not “sufficiently distinct,”\nAnnabi does not apply, and the USAO-SDNY was bound by the NPA not to bring\nthis charge. Count Six should be dismissed.\n\n4. There is affirmative <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY\n\nThe Annabi rule’s presumption is unavailing by its oun terms where “it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\nAnnabi at 672.\n\nHere, the “affirmative appearance” that a broader restriction was intended\nfor co-conspirators is evident within the four corners of the NPA, when the NPA is\nviewed as a whole. Unlike the agreement in Annabi and Abbamonte, the NPA is in\nwriten form and was carefully negotiated by sophisticated counsel. The absence of\nany limiting language in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp\ncontrast to the NPA’s provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is\nexpressly limited to prosecution “in this District.” Al75. It is difficult to envision a\nclearer “affirmative appearance” than the express inclusion elsewhere in the\nagreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here. Basic principles of\ncontract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered the inclusion\nof the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021121.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/4 of ll3\n3656o27, at *l & n.l (E.D.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said... what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021472.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document “EN 396 3536o39, Page42 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\n\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.47* OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l472", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021473.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3597 | 3536o39, Page43 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\n\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes.*?”\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\nae5 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n426 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\nseh Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F.

During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day\nadjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence.

On\nappeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule l6,\ntended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule\nl6(a)(l)(C} as requiring the production of items that are material to the preparation of the\ndefendant’s case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government’s argument, that the items\nmust be ‘materially exculpatory,’ Jd. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: “In United\nStates v.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023193.jpg": "accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023205.jpg": "Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24 Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023206.jpg": "Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]. . . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 7”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.jpg": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.74? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.jpg": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023308.jpg": "the PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.**4 OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.jpg": "investigation.

The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *”7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds are two\nmeans by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and\nMCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility\nat designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9. Houever, in documentation\ncompleted by the SHU staff on duty during that period, staff members falsely certified in the count slips that\nthey had conducted the required counts. Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that the staff assigned\nto the MCC New York SHU did not conduct any required 3o-minute rounds of inmates after approximately\nlo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9. Again, houever, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in\nthe round sheet that the required rounds were conducted. The combination of these and other failures led\nto Epstein being unmonitored and locked alone in his cell, which the OIG found contained an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his cell\nat approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records related to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said\nthey did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than\nsuicide. Additionally, none of the l5 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this\ninvestigation, lo of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and lo, had any credible information\nsuggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the\nthree interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that\nno one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of\nAugust 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU. SHU staff\ntold the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the\nevening and that there was no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that any of the other inmates could have goten out of their cells.\nAdditionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common\narea of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's\nrecording issues that we detail in this report. The OIG's analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCorrectional Officers (CO) or other individuals approaching any of the SHU tiers, including the L Tier where\n2 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute\nCheck Sheet.”\n3 For reasons we describe belou, while the camera inside the L Tier was working and transmiting live video, the video\nwas not being recorded.\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.jpg": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

These requests should be made as far in\nadvance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the\nresponsible Assistant United States Atorney cannot be contacted.\nFor co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from\nMCC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the\nresponsibility of the defense atorney to contact the responsible\nAssistant United States Atorney, who will, in turn, contact the\nUSMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of\nPrisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23752", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.jpg": "3 Emergency Telephone Calls\nInmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to 4a death\nor serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a\nrequest to the Religious Services Department. Likewise, if an\nindividual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they\nshould call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious\nServices Department.\nC. Legal Mail\nAll legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail\naddressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to\nsender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.\n\nl. Legal Mail Envelopes:\nThe Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may\nreceive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8; and\nBureau of Prisons Program Statement 58oo.lo, Mail Management\nManual (“PS 58oo.lo\"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides\nthat special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of\nthe inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately\nidentified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is\nmarked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\ninmate.’\" 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8(a). Houever, the presence of a\nreturn address with a firm name does not suffacientiy adentify\nthe sender of the material as an atorney.\n\nSpecifically, the atorney must be adequately\n\nidentified on the envelope as an atorney . . . The\n\nuse of the titie \"Esquire\" without additional\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of the sender's occupation does not\n\nestablish the bearer as an atorney or legal aid\n\nsupervisor. Mail from individuals using the title\n\n\"Esquire\" as the exclusive identification of their\n\nstatus shall not be handled as special mail, even if\n\nthe envelope contains some special mail markings.\nP.S. 58oo.l6, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handing of\nlegal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wil be\nenforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify\nlegai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's\nname) and their legal status (i.e., atorney), in the return\naddress portion of the envelope. This information, in addition\nto writing elsewhere on the envelope “Special Mail —- Open oniy\nin presence of inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated\nas confidential atorney-client communication.\n\nPage l2 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023763.jpg": "This can be accomplished by placing the empty botle on the daily\npill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least\nonce a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not he\nin possession of certain medications they need (certain\npsychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the\nmedication by pharmacy during daily pill line.\n4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)\nIf an atorney seeks a court order for an IME, the follouing\ninformation must be included:\n{l) Inmate’s name and register number;\n(2) A court order or similar court signea document for the\nexamination;\n(3) A provision for time and date to be determined by all\naffected parties;\n(4) Expected length of examination;\n{5) Name, title, and organization of each person atending\n(all-non atorneys and non-legal representatives will\nhave to fill out an application so MCC can complete a\nbackground check (See Atachment B);\n(6) List of all equipment to be used; and\n(7) An <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of whether the inmate’s consent has been\nobtained.\nAll of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will\nmake arrangements with the medical department for a convenient\ntime and date. The physician entering will be subject to using\nthe equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also\nhave to complete Atachment B.\n2 Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital\nAll USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will\nbe referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.\nI. Special Housing Unit (SHU)\nMCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general\npopulation. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:\nadministrative detention and disciplinary segregation.\nDisciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary\nsegregation upon determining that no other available disposition\nwill adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence\nnecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable\nlimits.\nPage 2o of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23763", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024095.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M_ Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/3o/2ol9 l5:58 Provider: Prema |p Unit:  Zol\nExam:\nCranial Nerves (CN)\nYes: Within Normal Limits\nMotor System-General\nYes: Normal Exam\nMotor System-Strength\nYes: Normal Muscular Strength\nASSESSMENT:\nBody mass index (BMI) 27.o-27.9, adult, 26827 -

Courts have generally\nfound that vague assertions that a deceased witness\nmight have provided favorable testimony do not justify\ndismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-4oo (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo5). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell\nprovides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> of what many of these potential\nwitnesses might have testified to. The testimony she\nsuggests the detective might have offered—that\nwitnesses in the Palm Beach investigation did not\nidentify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence\nthat does nothing to establish her innocence of the\ncharged offenses. There are also serious doubts under\nall of the relevant circumstances that a jury would\nhave found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and\ntestified on her behalf. See United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be\ndismissed because of the possibility of missing witnesses,\nfailing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons.\nThese are difficulties that arise in any case where\nthere is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United\nStates v. Marion, 4o4 US. 3o7, 325-26 (l97l); see United\nStates v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice\nfrom the pretrial publicity this case has garnered.\nMaxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this\ncase has transformed her reputation from that of\nEpstein’s friend to a co-conspirator.

Acosta replied, “I\ndon’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather\nleave it to you if that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that\n“absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed\nit was important for him “to not get involved” in\nnegotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and]\nback your AUSA, but ultimately, I think your trial\nlawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafana told\nOPR, houever, that she did not understand Acosta to\nbe giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as\nshe saw fit; rather, she believed Acosta did not want to\nengage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted\nto have an appearance of having sort of an arm’s\nlength from the deal.”!” Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\n\n9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s interpretation\nof her supervisors’ motivations for their actions often differed\nfrom the supervisors’ explanations for their actions.

Pet. App. loa; see zd. at 9a-loa\n& n.l3 (quoting language in the NPA protecting Epstein\nfrom charges “in this District”). The court also found no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that either the Southern District of New\nYork or the Criminal Division had reviewed and ap-\nproved the NPA, as DOJ policy would have required if\nthe NPA applied to other districts. See 7d. at loa. And\nthe court recognized that, from the inception of the of-\nfice in the Judiciary Act of l789, ch. 2o, § 35, l Stat. 92-\n93, a U.S. Atorney’s authority had always been “cab-\nined to their specific district unless otherwise directed.”\nPet. App. l2a; see zd. at lla-l2a & n.l8.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nPetitioner renews her contention (Pet. l2-l8) that\nEpstein’s nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. At-\ntorney for the Southern District of Florida barred peti-\ntioner’s prosecution by the U.S. Atorney for the South-\nern District of New York. That contention is incorrect,\nand petitioner does not shou that it would succeed in\nany court of appeals. This case would also be an unsuit-\nable vehicle for addressing the maters raised in the pe-\ntition for a writ of certiorari. This Court has previously\ndenied certiorari in a case raising a similar claim. See\nPrisco v. United States, 562 U.S. l29o (2oll) (No. lo-\n7895). It should follou the same course here.\n\nl. The court of appeals correctly held that Epstein’s\nNPA did not bar petitioner’s prosecution. Pet. App. 8a-\nl2a.\n\na. Petitioner asserts (Pet. l) that prosecution for one\nof her three counts of conviction was barred by a provision\nof Epstein’s NPA stating, in relevant part, that “the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo23o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000233.tif": "lo\ndid not take on some unique broader meaning in the co-\nconspirators’ clause. Cf. Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Gar-\nner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\nl7o-l73 (2ol2) (presumption of consistent usage).\n\nMoreover, even if the meaning of the coconspirators\nclause were not clear in context, extrinsic evidence\nwould resolve the ambiguity against petitioner. See\nUnited States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 54o, 55l (3d Cir. 2oo2).\nAt the time the NPA was negotiated, DOJ policy barred\nUSAOs from entering into NPAs that bound other dis-\ntricts unless they obtained the approval of those dis-\ntricts or the Criminal Division. Pet. App. loa. That pol-\nicy reflects the longstanding general rule that a U.S. At-\ntorney’s area of responsibility is limited to “his district.”\n28 U.S.C. 547; see Pet. App. lla-l2a. While petitioner\nsuggests (Pet. l8) that USAOs are instructed to be ex-\nplicit on that point, they are also instructed to consult\nwith other DOJ components if they intend to altogether\nforeclose any prosecution by other USAOs. See Justice\nManual § 9-27.63o. And there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> here that\nanyone involved in negotiating Epstein’s NPA obtained\nthe necessary approval for binding other USAOs or\nthought it was necessary. Pet. App. loa.\n\nb. Petitioner’s contrary arguments (Pet. l2-l8) lack\nmerit. She invokes general principles that prosecutors\nshould be held to the promises they make, see Pet. l3-\nl4 (discussing Santobello, supra, and Giglio v. United\nStates, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972)), and that “ambiguities in a\nplea agreement are to be resolved against the govern-\nment,” Pet. l6. But those arguments merely beg the\nquestions of what promises the NPA did make and\nwhether the NPA is ambiguous. As explained above,\nthe NPA’s coconspirators clause, read in context, is not\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000235.tif": "l2\n(the USAO) and the corresponding geographic limita-\ntions of that agreement, as reflected in its promises re-\ngarding the prosecution of Epstein himself.\n\nPetitioner’s remaining arguments are likewise mis-\nplaced. Her effort (Pet. l5-l6) to link the coconspira-\ntors clause with other NPA provisions addressing\npotential civil suits under l8 U.S.C. 2255 (2oo6) is self-\ndefeating, since the later provisions reinforce the\nNPA’s limitation to the Southern District of Florida.\nSee Pet. App. 28a (providing that “Epstein will not con-\ntest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Florida” in such suits). Sim-\nilarly unavailing is petitioner’s emphasis (Pet. l7) on\nlanguage in one draft of the NPA that would have ex-\npressly limited the coconspirators’ protection to the\nSouthern District of Florida. See Pet. App. ll7a. There\nis no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that anyone involved in drafting the\nNPA understood the different versions of the cocon-\nspirators clause to have different geographic scopes.\nSee id. at l22a-l23a; see also id. at l25a n.l25 (former\nFirst Assistant U.S. Atorney telling DOJ investigators\nthat “the NPA was not a ‘global resolution’ and other\nco-conspirators could have been prosecuted ‘by any\nother U.S. Atorney’s office in the country’”) (brackets\nomited). As the district court explained, an NPA “need\nnot painstakingly spell out ‘the Office of the United\nStates Atorney for Such-and-Such District’ in every in-\nstance to make clear that it applies only in the district\nwhere signed.” Jd. at 56a-57a.\n\nAt all events, the case-specific interpretation of a\nparticular NPA is not a mater that warrants this\nCourt’s review. See Sup. Ct. R. lo. And that is especially\ntrue where “district court and court of appeals are in\nagreement as to what conclusion the record requires.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo235", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022773.tif": "Page 23o\nl your father's company had with --\n2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.\n3 TODD BLANCHE: -- embezzlement or\n4 allegations of --\n5 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.

Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!?

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.tif": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span>.””? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration.

In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023193.tif": "accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023205.tif": "Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.7°° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\n24o The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023206.tif": "Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 7”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.tif": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.4? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it .. . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.tif": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023308.tif": "the PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims identified during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those identified during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims identified during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*’4 OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the identified victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims identified in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 identified federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.tif": "investigation.

Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\n<span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.

Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9. Houever, in documentation\ncompleted by the SHU staff on duty during that period, staff members falsely certified in the count slips that\nthey had conducted the required counts. Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that the staff assigned\nto the MCC New York SHU did not conduct any required 3o-minute rounds of inmates after approximately\nlo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9. Again, houever, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in\nthe round sheet that the required rounds were conducted. The combination of these and other failures led\nto Epstein being unmonitored and locked alone in his cell, which the OIG found contained an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his cell\nat approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records related to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said\nthey did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than\nsuicide. Additionally, none of the l5 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this\ninvestigation, lo of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and lo, had any credible information\nsuggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the\nthree interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that\nno one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of\nAugust 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU. SHU staff\ntold the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the\nevening and that there was no <span class=\"highlight\">indication</span> that any of the other inmates could have goten out of their cells.\nAdditionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common\narea of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's\nrecording issues that we detail in this report. The OIG's analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCorrectional Officers (CO) or other individuals approaching any of the SHU tiers, including the L Tier where\n2 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute\nCheck Sheet.”\n3 For reasons we describe belou, while the camera inside the L Tier was working and transmiting live video, the video\nwas not being recorded.\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.tif": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

Noel also told the Lieutenant,\n“We didn’t do rounds at 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.” Thomas stated, “We didn’t do the rounds.

The physician entering will be subject to using\nthe equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also\nhave to complete Atachment B.\n5, Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital\nAll USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will\nbe referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.\nI. Special Housing Unit (SHU)\nMCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general\npopulation. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:\nadministrative detention and disciplinary segregation.\nDisciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the\ngeneral population in which inmates who commit serious violations\nof Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nfor specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general\npopulation. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary\nsegregation upon determining that no other available disposition\nwill adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence\nnecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable\nlimits.\nPage 2o of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23763"};
