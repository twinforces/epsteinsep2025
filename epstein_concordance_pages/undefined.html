As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about <span class=\"highlight\">undefined</span> “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported connection between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate corruption\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in connection with defendant’s bail application, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB. The Perjury Counts Should Be Severed Under Rule l4(a) Because Their\n\nInclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial\n\nEven if the Court finds that joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court should nevertheless\nexercise its discretion to sever Counts Five and Six under Rule l4(a) because of the substantial\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and these proceedings. A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will require\na full-bloun re-litigation of the defamation action, which will result in a collateral mater taking\nover the trial. Substantial amounts of evidence that would be inadmissible and irrelevant as to\nthe Mann Act Counts will, necessarily, be presented in order to prove the Perjury Counts.

The NPA’s Prohibition on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is\nNot Limited to Prosecution for Conduct Between 2ool and 2oo7 or for\nParticular Statutory Offenses.\n\nFinally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity provision\nas “limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7 . . . and to violations of statutes\nnot charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at 5-6. This characterization is grossly inaccurate.\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision contains no limitation as to either the time period or the\nstatutes on which such criminal charges might be based.’\n\nJust as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language\nlimiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify\nthe conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,\npotential co-conspirators—cannot be prosecuted. As with its failure to limit the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not nou rewrite the NPA to limit the\nscope of covered conduct in a manner that it failed to do in drafting the NPA. At minimum, the\nabsence of any such limitation renders the scope of the provision ambiguous, and any ambiguity\nmust be construed against the government. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89.\n\nWhile the NPA’s factual recitals reference the 2ool-o7 time period and list five potential\nstatutory offenses, the NPA’s substantive provisions establish no such limit on the immunity for\npotential co-conspirators—or, for that mater, for Epstein himself—to either that time period or\nthose offenses.

The questions posed to Ms. Maxwell were\npoorly phrased without regard to the rules of evidence. Accordingly, counsel for Ms. Maxwell\nwas required to object many times. As this court knous, civil litigants are limited to three types\nof objections: form, foundation, and privilege. When those objections are posed, the examiner\nhas the opportunity to ask for the basis of the objection. It is not incumbent, indeed it is not\npermited, for the objecting lawyer to expound on the basis for the objection unless asked.\nVirtually all of the questions that form the basis of Counts Five and Six were the subject\nof valid objections. A prerequisite to use of deposition testimony at trial is that the testimony\nmust be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence as if the deponent were present and\ntestifying. Fed. R. Civ.

It is unlikely that any\nof the answers would have been admited at any trial.\nII. The Questions Were Fundamentally, and Fatally, Ambiguous\nIn addition to being poorly phrased, the questions were unquestionably ambiguous.\n“TW |hen a line of questioning is so vague as to be “fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support\n[a] perjury conviction.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. l986); see also United\nStates v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). “Precise questioning is imperative as a\npredicate for the offense of perjury.” Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). “A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of\nordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a\nquestioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as\ntestimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up). Here, the questions were “fundamentally\nambiguous,” containing particular <span class=\"highlight\">undefined</span> terms, “scheme” and “recruit” for example.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel3 of l6\ncourt held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a mater of\nlaw to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about <span class=\"highlight\">undefined</span> terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352 (l973), makes clear that an individual cannot be\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo372l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page7of8\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell should not be required to expend considerable time\nand resources obtaining relevant exculpatory evidence that could have been seized or\nsubpoenaed by the government. Premature disclosure of the evidence would impinge on Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and reveal defense strategy and work\nproduct.\n\nRule l6, not Rule l7, governs the timing of any reciprocal discovery request, and it\nprovides that if a defendant requests disclosure from the government under Rule l6(a)(l)(E),\nthen upon compliance with a similar request by the government, the defendant is required to\npermit the government to inspect and copy or photograph documents and tangible objects\nwhich are within the possession, custody or control of the defendant and which the defendant\nintends to introduce at trial. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A); United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp.\n2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nVv. Any Protective Order Regarding the Rule l7 Material Should Be Separate\nfrom the Protective Order Entered at the Insistence of the Government and Over Ms.\nMaxwell’s Objection\n\nThe government has repeatedly objected to any modification of the Protective Order\nentered in this case.?

Much of the information\n(emma vor hate, Aaeesmel, seven te to negotiate reciprocal protective order protections in\nJuly 2o2o, but the government steadfastly then insisted that a separate negotiation would\noccur at an <span class=\"highlight\">undefined</span> later time to any materials to be produced by defense counsel.

Such an interpretation, rather than an insertion\ninto the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the\ngovernment’s interests here, is the “common-sense way to read the NPA” that the Court should\nadopt. See Opp. l6.\n\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Conduct Discovery and an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach\nof the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars\nMs. Maxwell’s prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must\nhave meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These\narguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected.\n\nShould the Court have any doubt about the parties’ intent, houever, discovery and an\nevidentiary hearing regarding the parties’ intent are warranted. The government’s arguments\nregarding the parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For\nexample, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is\ndeemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated\nwithout determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the\nFBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into “Epstein’s background”), as well as\nwhich offenses arose out of the <span class=\"highlight\">undefined</span> “Federal Grand Jury investigation.” Similarly, the\ngovernment’s claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms.\nMaxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the\nSDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL’s awareness\nof Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District.
