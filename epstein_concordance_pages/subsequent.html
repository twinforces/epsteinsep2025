Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is\nunable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct\nan inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the\nCourt to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l),\nthe Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,\nand accorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\ninternational travel” in the last three years (Gov.

Ms. Maxwell made efforts to\nremove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into\nher personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, hy from third parties\nwho threatened violence.

Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def.

The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001269.jpg": "Casesb:2o-cr/oo8BQlAU At DOMED l/2o 2 Filedees/2G/PIagPage 45l65l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited).

Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,\nwhich has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the\nUnited States. Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\ninternational travel” in the last three years (Gov.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

This Opinion is provided pursuant to instructions from Peters and Peters Solicitors LLP’ dated l2\nAugust 2o2o in the context of bail proceedings relating to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell before the United\nStates District Court, Southern District of New York. <span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> instructions have confirmed that Ms\nMaxwell will execute a waiver of her right to extradition that could be exhibited to a future extradition\nrequest made by the United States and relied upon in any extradition proceedings. The specific\nquestions asked by Peters and Peters are atached at Annex A. A summary of counsel’s relevant\nexperience is atached at Annex B. The waiver is atached at Annex C.\n\n2. Insummary:\n\n(a) Extradition proceedings in the United Kingdom are governed by the Extradition Act 2oo3\n(‘the 2oo3 Act’) and, in general, comprise; (i) a hearing before a designated ‘appropriate\nJudge’ (the extradition hearing); and (i) an appeal, subject to a leave requirement.\n\n(b) In proceedings under the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may consent to their extradition\nwhich has the effect of removing the need for an extradition hearing and waiving the\nperson’s statutory appeal rights.\n\n(c) In the majority of cases, proceedings in England and Wales in relation to US extradition\nrequests are concluded in under two years’. The process is significantly shorter if the\nrequested person consents to their extradition and in those cases the timescales are\napproximately between one and three months.\n\n(d) It is extremely unlikely that bail would be granted in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United States\nprior to trial and in breach of bail.\n\n' The follouing documents were annexed to the instructions: (a) Superseding Indictment, United States v Ghislaine\nMaxwell, dated 8 July 2o2o; (b) a transcript of the arraignment and bail hearing that took place on l4 July 2o2o; (c) the\nMotion to Detain the Defendant dated 2 July 2o2o; (d) the Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion for Detention dated\nlo July 2o2o; (e) and the Government Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention dated l3 July 2o2o.\n° There is no data as to the duration of extradition proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland but it may be inferred\nthat the timescales are similar.\nl922623.l\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-2l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 9 of 29\n\nIn three of the five cases the applicant was either a British citizen or had significant community and\n\nfamily ties to the UK”! but these were outweighed by the risk of flight, and in the other case, the lack of\n\nsubstantial community ties was cited as a factor in refusing bail”.\n\n23. As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to\n\nthe US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n24. The offences in the superseding indictment are extradition offences within the meaning of section l37\n\nof the Extradition Act 2oo3”.\n\n25.

The Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not specify which internal\nprocedures must be folloued in each contracting State follouing the transmission of the\nextradition request through the diplomatic channel pursuant to Article lo. We must\ntherefore refer to provisions of the French Code of Criminal Procedure to outline the\nprocedure folloued by French institutions upon receipt of an extradition request made\nby the USA.\n\nl3.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 22\nAmendment rights); see also People v.

The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 26 of 38\nprovision as to Epstein. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424\nF.3d l95, 2o6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“In interpreting a contract under New York law, ‘words and\nphrases ... should be given their plain meaning,’ and the contract ‘should be construed so as to\ngive full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.’”) (citations omited); Port Consol., Inc. v.\nInt’l Ins. Co. of Hannover, PLC, 826 F. App’x 822, 827 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (same under Florida\nlaw). The Justice Manual supports this view, admonishing prosecutors who do not wish to bind\nUSAOs in other districts to “explicitly limit the scope” of the NPA to their districts. Justice\nManual, Comment to § 9-27.63o (emphasis added). The absence of the phrase “in this District”\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision therefore compels the opposite inference: that the\nparties did not intend to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the SDFL.\n\nMoreover, “a promise to bind other districts can be inferred from the negotiations\nbetween defendant and prosecutor.” Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626. One relevant factor in this analysis\nis the extent to which the USAO negotiating the plea agreement acted on its oun, as opposed to\ninvolving other USAOs or other offices within the Department of Justice. Cf, e.g., United States\nv. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 32l, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (finding that defendant “offers no\nmeaningful support for his claim that he ‘reasonably understood’ the Agreement to bar\n<span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> prosecutions in this District... . He does not claim, for example, that the SDNY\nUSAO was in any way consulted or involved in the plea negotiations.”); United States v.\nLaskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y.) (“defendants concede [] that the Central District had\nno knouledge of the investigation that was taking place in the Eastern District at the time the\nCentral District plea was being negotiated. .. . The Central District, unaware of defendants’\npotential criminal liability in the Eastern District, could not have intended to insulate defendants\nfrom prosecution which they had no reason to foresee.”), aff'd, 867 F.2d l425 (2d Cir. l988).\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 27 of 38\n\nHere, we understand that senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved in the\nnegotiation and approval of the NPA, and the NPA itself reflects the involvement of the FBI.\nNPA at l. Moreover, the USAO-SDFL’s involvement of the USAO for this District in its\ninvestigation of Epstein, as well its contact with witnesses in New York, reflect a coordinated\neffort that transcended the USAO-SDFL. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. From these facts, it\naffirmatively appears that the government had every reason to foresee a potential prosecution of\nEpstein’s co-conspirators in this District and, after multiple layers of review within the\nDepartment of Justice, intended to agree to preclude it.\n\nb. The Second Circuit’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> application of Annabi supports\nMs. Maxwell’s position.\n\nIn nearly all of the cases in which the Second Circuit has reiterated its statement in\nAnnabi in the context of writen plea agreements, those agreements, unlike the NPA here,\ncontained language expressly limiting the enforceability of the NPA to the district in which it\nwas made. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“agreement\nis limited to the United States Atorney's Office for the District of New Jersey and cannot bind\nother federal, state, or local authorities”); United States v.

The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 25\ntypically give it great weight in interpreting federal statutes.

In the Alternative, the Government Should Be Required to Demonstrate the\n\nAdmissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nAt a minimum, the government should not be permited to use the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 to perform an end-run around Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). Rather, the government should be\nrequired to demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) of any evidence regarding\nAccuser-3.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> ‘bad\nacts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United\nStates v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed.

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002758.jpg": "¥& ; l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65-l Filed o3/o9/2l Page 2 of 2\nMINISTRY OF JUSTICE\nLiberty Directorate of Criminal Affairs & Pardons\nEquality\nFraternity\nSpecialized Criminal Justice Sub-Directorate\nInternational Criminal Assistance Bureau\nParis, March 9, 2o2l\nHis Honor the Keeper of Seals, Minister of Justice\nTo the\nDepartment of Justice (D.O.J)\nThrough Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate on behalf of the\nEmbassy of the United States of America located in Paris, France\n\nThereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are\ngoverned by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nArticle 696-2 of said Code provides that: “The French government is able to remit to\n\nforeign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a\nlawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said\nrequesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic.”\n\nArticle 694-4 expressly specifies as follous:\n\n“Removal is not granted:\n\nl- When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been\n\nassessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being\n\nrequested.”\n\nWHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an\ninsuperable obstacle to his/her removal.

Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Here, it is unclear whether interlocutory appeal of a\ndistrict court’s decision regarding bail “divests the court of its control over aspects of the case\ninvolved in the appeal.” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996). Were it so, a\ndistrict court would have no authority to remand or modify bail conditions of a defendant\nreleased while the government appeals the grant of bail. Such a rule would detract from, rather\nthan promote, judicial economy and would be unworkable in practice.\n\nShould the Court believe it does not have jurisdiction to decide the present bail\nmotion, Ms. Maxwell will move the Circuit to withdraw her notice of appeal without\nprejudice and thereby remove any theoretical bar to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\npresent bail motion. Should the Court summarily deny the present motion on the merits,\n\nMs. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal and request consolidation of both appeals.\nRenunciation of Foreign Citizenship is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release\n\nRelying on a leter from the French Ministry of Justice, the government urges the\nCourt to give no weight to Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renounce her foreign citizenship.\nBut the leter is wrong on the law and should be disregarded. The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.

Indeed, and as noted\nabove in a related context, it would be exceedingly strange to interpret the “co-conspirator”\nprovision to extend broader immunity than Epstein negotiated for himself.\n\nThe defendant may assert that the “co-conspirator” provision has absolutely no limitations,\nbut such an argument would lead to absurd results. In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations whatsoever, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical interpretation\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has interpreted a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “background,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “background.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation. As discussed in greater detail belou, Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-3\nwere never interviewed by the USAO-SDFL, and they did not agree to speak with law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S.\n665, 688 (l972) (“Although the pouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 239\nchoices reflected in the criminal discovery rules.” Jd. Second, doing so “risks invading ‘the\ninviolable function of the jury’ in our criminal justice system.’” /d. at 28l (citation omited).\nAccordingly, if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is inextricably intertwined with a\ndefendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that dispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” Jd.\n\nThe exception to this rule is “extraordinarily narrou” because, in the normal course, the\n“government must make a detailed presentation of the entirety of the evidence before a district\ncourt can dismiss an indictment on sufficiency grounds,” which the Government is not required to\ndo at the motion-to-dismiss stage. /d. at 282 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). That\npoint is underscored by United States v. Nitsche, 843 F. Supp. 2d 4 (D.D.C. 2oll), on which the\ndefendant relies. There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence. First, houever, the court explained that the question was ripe\nbecause “(l) Defendant has stipulated to the entire record that is relevant to Count I; (2) the\nGovernment has had several opportunities to make a proffer of any additional facts, to conduct\nany <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> investigation, and to ask the Court for further delay to seek more evidence; and (3)\nbecause the record is limited to the chat.” Jd. at 9. Accordingly, “[t]he transcripts themselves\nprovide the Court with all of the relevant undisputed facts to decide the motion.” /d. Here, of\ncourse, that is simply not the case and, in particular, there is no stipulation as to the entire relevant\nrecord.\n\nUnder the relevant legal standard, the defendant’s statements were material if they could\nhave led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the factfinder in the defendant’s\ncivil case. Evaluating that standard necessarily implicates facts beyond the deposition testimony\nitself and Judge Preska’s unsealing order,*’ such as identification of the allegedly defamatory\n°° The defendant observes that Judge Preska redacted some of the statements that form the basis\nof Count Six, stating that the “testimony is . . . far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l4 of 239\nGovernment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained\ntherein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not\nentitled to its immediate disclosure. The Government will produce an unredacted version of this\ndocument together with all other witness statements in advance of trial.®”\n\nFourth, the defense requests production of pages from a personal diary that is in the custody\nof a civilian third party and is not in the custody or control of the Government. (Def. Mot. lo at\nlo). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the\nGovernment has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“The Government’s ‘Brady obligations extend\nonly to materials within prosecutors’ possession, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that\nof the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state\nauthority involved in the federal prosecution.’” (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp.\n3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third\nparty at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist.\nIn particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entries from the\nspring of l996, the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant’s second bail\nmotion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. loo at ll n. 2 (“Because this victim stopped writing\nin her journal about a month after that first meeting with Epstein, there are no entries regarding the\n<span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> trip she took months later to visit Epstein, during which she met the defendant.

Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\nidentified by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the construction\nof the qualified wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “qualified wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the qualified wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the qualified\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the qualified jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the construction of the qualified wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit identified the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). Even if this argument\ndescribed a function of the jury selection process — though it does not — it would be directed at the\n\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 348\ncarefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed\nappropriate; OPR did not, houever, alter its findings and conclusions.\n\nFinally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and\natorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case\nand to determine whether the subjects commited professional misconduct.\n\nAs part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the\nfederal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state\nofficials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state\ninvestigation.’ Because OPR’s mission is to ensure that Department atorneys adhere to the\nstandards of professional conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the subject\natorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his assistants’ criminal\nbehavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nl. OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°* During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.”. Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo326o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!\"°\n\nHouever, a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003306.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 348\na i? ys Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division sie\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie * John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior Associate\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA. February — May l5, 2oo8: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division\nOn February 2l, 2oo8, soon after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with victims, Oosterban\nspoke with Lefkouitz about CEOS’s role.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates. See\nllo\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4o of 348\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWI.

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 <span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?!

Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\noe?

As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> legislation, passed by a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page/7ofl7\n\nThe government also asserts, without explanation, that the Perjury Counts are of “similar\ncharacter” to the Mann Act Counts.

Here, the co-conspirator provision of the NPA provides that if Epstein\nabides by the terms of the agreement, “the United States” will not institute any criminal charges\n“against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” which immunizes Ms. Maxwell for the\noffenses covered by the NPA. (Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a conspiracy charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was abandoned as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six\nfor the identical charges that were resolved by the NPA.

As noted in\nour previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity\nprovision of the NPA stands in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is\nexpressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt. 223 at 9-lo). The broad language of the co-conspirator\nprovision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his atorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFL, that\nhe would be “the only one who takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR Report at l67\n(internal quotations omited)). Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal “to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability,” which is set forth in the factual recitals of the\nNPA. (Ex. B at 2 of 7; see also Ex. D § 5 (declaration of AUSA A. Marie Villafafia noting that\nEpstein “sought a global resolution of the mater”). Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware\nthat the investigation had extended beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.\nIndeed, we nou knou from discovery recently produced by the government that the government\ninterviewed at least three New York-based witnesses in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation, two of whom implicated other potential co-conspirators of Epstein.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 38 of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 64 of 349\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.*’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“i]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°® During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.”°’ Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\na Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\nm8 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\n9 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8o of 349\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\n| Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalin Beach County State Atomey’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a cluld, in violation of Fl.

The\n\ncontemporaneous emails shou that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered\nmultiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the\nstate plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear\nthat as the negotiations intensified in September 2oo7, the prosecutors became increasingly\nfrustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and\nprovisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> communications.\nIt is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 85 of 349\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAuGust 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7, I have conferred\nwith U.S. Atorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of\nincarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,\nhe is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.\nSincerely,\nR.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 94 of 349\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3l of 349\nrene eae Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division z ole\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie * John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior Associate\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ... I would like to have .. . some\nclosure with you on this mater so that in the years to come, neither of us will harbor any ill will\nover the mater.”\n\nX. JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4l of 349\nuntil after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is\nin the agreement.”!”? On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l44 of 349\nthe Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, ‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case. After that encounter, Dershouitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with hou the Palm Beach sheriff administers”\nEpstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:\n\nRegarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Atorney’s Office will not\ninterfere with hou the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the\nsentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean\nthat the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the\nterms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean\nthat, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or\nin-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted\nwe will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram. Florida Statute § 948.ool(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the\ncommunity.”\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004534.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 237 of 349\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 <span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 27l of 349\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies. Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°? The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9). Among other things, the court rejected the petitioners’ contention\nthat it did not address whether the government had violated the victims’ CVRA right to be treated with fairness and\nto receive fair notice of the proceedings, noting that “[t]hese rights all flou from the right to confer and were\nencompassed in the Court’s ruling finding a violation of the CVRA.”\noe?

As previously noted, at this point, the litigation was being handled by the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia.\n392 The government also noted that although the CVRA was amended in 2ol5 to include a victim’s right to be\nnotified in a timely manner of plea bargains and deferred prosecution agreements, “the amendment did not extend to\nnon-prosecution agreements” which, unlike plea agreements and deferred prosecution agreements, do not require court\ninvolvement.\n\n244\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004790.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page6of2l\n\nA.

Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v.

A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses. See In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987); Dkt. No. l34-l 4 l3. A court may (as here)\nunseal documents covered by a civil protective order in the public interest. See Broun, 929 F.3d\nat 47; Giuffre v. Maxwell, 827 F. App’x l44, l45 (2d Cir. 2o2o); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Civil litigants have neither a reasonable basis nor\nlegal entitlement to rely on a civil protective order against the use of their testimony in a\n<span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal proceeding.\n\nMaxwell thus has failed to establish the first and most fundamental element of a violation\nof her right against compelled self-incrimination: compulsion. Because the protection typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page 8of2l\ninculpatory. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 4lo-ll. This is no such case. The existence of deposition\ntranscripts in Maxwell’s civil case is not inculpatory. It is the content of those transcripts that is\nat issue.\n\nIn the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relies primarily on a single\ndistrict court case decided the year before the Second Circuit’s decision in Andover that quashed\na subpoena for deposition testimony covered by a civil protective order. See Dkt. No. l4o, at\nl6-l7 (citing United States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988)); Dkt. No. 2l2, at l2-\nl3 (same). Oshatz does not suggest that the use of civil deposition testimony in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncriminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against compelled self-incrimination—and if it\ndid, that view would be plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential\nopinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a court should modify a\nprotective order to allou a government subpoena. Maxwell cites no case in which a court has\nsuppressed evidence because another court erred in modifying a protective order. Even if\nMaxwell were right that the protective order should not have been modified, it would not\ntransform her earlier deposition testimony into the product of coercion.\n\nThe Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against\nher in her perjury trial notwithstanding any violation of her right against compelled self-\nincrimination. The Supreme Court has held that a defendant may be prosecuted for false\nstatements in unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l79\n(l977); United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 82 (l969). As in Knox, Maxwell seeks to suppress\nher deposition transcripts not because they are inculpatory “for a prior or <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal\nact” but because her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal. Knox,\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Pageloof2l\nSupreme Court has held that people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in geographical\ninformation obtained from their cell phones, because that information provides a comprehensive\naccount of a person’s movements akin to invasive physical surveillance. See Carpenter, l38 S.\nCt. at 22l9-2o.\n\nUnder this standard, Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents\nproduced during the civil litigation. Those documents may not have been public, but they were\nhardly private. The protective order alloued them to be shared freely with each of the follouing\ncategories of people:\n\ne The parties to the case.\n\ne Atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne People employed by or associated with atorneys involved in the case.\n\ne Expert witnesses.\n\ne Fact witnesses.\n\ne Potential witnesses.\n\ne Court personnel and stenographers.\nIt also alloued any documents to be publicly used at trial.

The Second Circuit has cautioned civil litigants that a civil protective order is no\nguarantee against the use of evidence in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal prosecution. See Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83.

As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application. Because the Government’s\nalleged misrepresentation was not necessary to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot support\nsuppression under Franks.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3 of 8o\nevidence upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident\ncould be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”'\n\nSeeking “some measure of justice” for Constand, D.A.

Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A.

Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies.

Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings.

Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it.

Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him.

The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v.

Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo498o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 69\nae once mentioned Ms. Maxwell.”> See 35o5-oo5.

(Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the interaction of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 32\nanother.” (quoting Texaco Inc. v.

McGohey, l87 F.2d l4, l5 (2d Cir. l95l) (when\nthere is an intra-circuit conflict, courts must follou the earlier decision).\n\nOf course, this Court need not conclude that Shaoul is inconsistent with McDonough and\nLangford in order to reject the government’s argument. As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial.

Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v. Greer, which reads McDonough and Langford just as Ms.\nMaxwell reads them, even while citing Shaoul. United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l-72 (2d\nCir. 2oo2). As the Court explained in Greer, “McDonough establishes a multi-part test in which\na juror’s dishonesty is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias.\n...” Id. at l73 (citing Langford, 99o F.2d at 68-7o (emphasis added)).

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ). In her cross motion respondent seeks to convert the current suspension to a medical suspension\nnunc pro tunc, but further seeks an order vacating the suspension and reinstating her to the practice of law, due to\nher year-long sobriety.\n\nThe Commitee's motion, and the first branch of respondent's cross motion, are granted to the extent that the\nprior finding of non-cooperation is vacated and an order **l89 of suspension based upon the atorney's medical dis-\nability is granted nunc pro tune (see Mater of Kaplan, 65 A.D.3d 287, 883 N.Y.S.2d l82 [2oo9]: Mater of Fusco,\nl8 A.D.3d 8l, 798 N.Y.S.2d 364 [2oo5] ).\n\n[l][2] Houever, that branch of respondent's cross motion seeking immediate reinstatement is denied at this\ntime. The cross motion itself concedes the existence of the alcohol dependence rendering her unfit to practice law;\nadditionally, she acknouledged during her deposition that her failure to cooperate and *l7o her underlying conduct\nwas related to alcoho! dependency. To support her cross motion, respondent implies that the examining psychiatrist\nfailed to satisfy an obligation to establish that she continues to be unfit to resume her practice, Houever, to be enti-\ntled to reinstatement, since the initial infirmity has been conceded, it is respondent who must prove her fitness to be\nreinstated (see 22 NYCRR 6o3.l6[f] ), and that burden is not satisfied here by her oun self-assessment (see Mater\nof Stewart, 47 A.D.3d 43, 846 N.Y.S.2d l3 [2oo7] ). The branch of respondent's cross motion seeking reinstatement\nto the practice of law therefore must be denied at this time, without prejudice to a further application, supported by\nan evaluation by a mental health provider atesting to her current fitness to re-commence the practice of law (see\nMater of Supino, 23 A.D.3d ll, l4, 8o6 N.Y.S.2d l78 [2oo5] ).\n\nAccordingly, the Commitee's motion and respondent's cross motion should be granted to the extent that the pri-\nor order's finding of non-cooperation is vacated, and respondent is suspended from the practice of law for an indefi-\n© 2ol] Thomson Reuters.

In fact,\nl9 we knou that prior to voir dire, they discussed the suspension\n2o opinion, they chose not to bring it to the Court's atention.\n2l Instead relying simply on the voir dire answers; even though as\n22 this Court pointed out, far more trivial issues were aired by\n23 all of the parties, by the government and indeed by the Court,\n24 in terms of trying to figure out who would be good jurors.\n25 They chose not to bring that to the Court's atention then\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications.

Mot. at l3). The Court was right to reject these arguments during trial.\n\nFirst, the meaning of the jury note is entirely ambiguous. It is at a minimum unclear (l)\nwhich flights are referenced in the note, (2) where the sexual activity was intended to occur, and\n(3) what question is posed by the note.\n\nThe defendant argues that the note’s mention of a flight to New Mexico is a specific\nreference to a l997 flight from New York to New Mexico captured in the flight logs that lists both\nthe defendant and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX 662-R at 48)). The jury\nmay have considered that flight, or some other flight. (See, e.g., GX 662 at 5l (flight to Santa Fe\nfrom Palm Beach with Epstein, the defendant, and “l female”); Tr. 3l6 (testimony from Jane that\nshe sometimes traveled on commercial flights)). If it was that flight, the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> flight record\ndeparting Santa Fe did not include the defendant or Jane (see GX 662 at 48), providing no\ninformation about the flight that the defendant thinks was the focus of the jury’s atention. And to\nthe extent it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to New Mexico was New York, so the jury\ncould easily have inferred that the “return” trip was also to New York. That is, the defendant may\nor may not be right about which flight the jury had in mind. And ifthe jury was asking about this\ntrip, the jury could well have been asking about a flight to New York—which, if the defendant\narranged, could have been highly significant and proper evidence of guilt. The defendant’s\npresumption that the jury was focused on this particular trip and specifically on a return flight to\nFlorida with no relevance to the case is mere conjecture.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009887.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l8 of 32\nanother.” (quoting Texaco Inc. v.

As described above, Shaoul does not\naddress the reading of McDonough that Ms. Maxwell advocates for here, since it did not discuss\nor even cite the McDonough concurring opinions.\n\nMoreover, Second Circuit cases follouing Lanford and Shaoul have reaffirmed that a\ndeliberate falsehood is not a prerequisite to a new trial.

Jn Stewart, for example, decided in 2oo6, the Court cited and quoted McDonough\nand yet did not require a deliberately false answer, stating instead that “a party alleging\nunfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire\nresponse was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3 (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nThen there’s United States v.

Conrad was admited to the practice of law in the State of New York by the Se-\ncond Judicial Department on January 26, 2ooo, and, at all times relevant to this proceeding, has maintained an office\nfor the practice of law within the First Judicial Department.\n\nIn a previous order dated December l8, 2oo7, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for fail-\nure to respond to requests made by the Departmental Disciplinary Commitee pursuant to its investigation of two\ncomplaints made against her (22 NYCRR 6o3.4[e][l][i] ). After receiving a response by respondent six months later\nseeking an opportunity to respond to the complaints, the Commitee conducted an investigation. Based upon re-\nspondent's admited problem with alcohol dependency, which she acknouledged was connected to her failure to\ncooperate and the underlying conduct, the Commitee obtained a psychiatric evaluation of respondent in November\n2oo9, and a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> re-evaluation in May 2olo. The psychiatrist determined that respondent's prognosis is good,\nbut did not go as far as to assert that she is nou fit to re-commence the practice of law.\n\nThe Departmental Disciplinary Commitee nou moves for an order suspending respondent from the practice of\nlaw on the ground that she suffers from a “disability by reason of physical or mental infirmity or illness” (22 NY-\nCRR 6o3.l6{c][l] ).

The defendant reaches this lou number by disputing four aspects of\nthe Probation Office’s calculation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s Guidelines objections in their entirety. It would be both strange and anomalous for\nthe Sentencing Guidelines to recommend such a short sentence for a defendant who spent years\nsexually exploiting teenage girls. The Sentencing Guidelines do not provide for a such an\noutcome.\n\nA. The 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to use the Guidelines\nManual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced, which here would result in applying\nthe 2o2l Guidelines Manual (the “2o2l Manual”). U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(a). Where, as here, the\ncurrent Guidelines Manual provides a higher range than the Manual in effect at the time of the\noffense conduct, using the current manual would violate the Ex Post Facto clause. U.S.S.G.\n§ lBl.ll(b)(l); Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 544 (2ol3). Here, the 2o2l Manual calls\nfor a substantially higher guidelines calculation than the Government seeks. For example, under\nthe 2o2l Manual, the base offense level would be 3o before any enhancements are applied,\nwhereas the 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the “2oo4 Manual’) provides for a base offense\nlevel of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2o2l Manual, the offense level is at\nleast six levels higher. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4) with U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a)(2) (2o2l).\nAs a result, the Court may not apply the 2o2l Manual, but the Supreme Court has made clear that\n<span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> increases in the Guidelines may be a reason the sentencing court may deviate upwards\nfrom the applicable Guidelines, and sentencing courts are “free to give careful consideration to the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 25of55\n\nWhat the record makes clear is that the defendant remained a close associate of Jeffrey\nEpstein and continued to profit from their criminal relationship, long past 2oo4. There is nothing\npunitive about applying the 2oo4 Guidelines, which apply here as a mater of law. If anything, the\nfact that the defendant will be sentenced under the 2oo4 Guidelines, and not the higher range under\nthe 2o2l Guidelines, should be a factor that warrants a higher sentence. Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas expressly noted that sentencing courts may consider <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> increases in offense levels for\nprecisely that purpose. See Peugh, 569 U.S. at 549.\n\nB. The Four-Point Leadership Enhancement Applies\n\nThe Government agrees with the Probation Office that the enhancement in U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l applies because the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was\n“otherwise extensive.” The defendant’s conspiracy spanned at least five victims in three states,\nthe United Kingdom, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including at Epstein’s various properties, which\nthe defendant ran, over the course of a decade. It involved the participation of numerous members\nof the defendant and Epstein’s staff, whether knouing or unknouing, and the use of minor victims\nto recruit other minor victims. See U.S.S.G. § 3Bl.l app. n.3 (“In assessing whether an\norganization is ‘otherwise extensive,’ all persons involved during the course of the entire offense\nare to be considered,” and use of “the unknouing services of many outsiders could be considered\nextensive.”). For instance, Carolyn testified that she was recruited by Virginia and that Carolyn\nrecruited other minor victims. Juan Alessi testified that he was driving when the defendant stopped\nto recruit Virginia. Two pilots testified about transporting minor victims on Epstein’s planes. That\nalone is five individuals involved in the criminal activity, without even counting the defendant\nherself, Epstein, and Sarah Kellen. See United States v.

The government should be instructed that it cannot\ndiscuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.\n\nSimilarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-l to\n“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear\nto be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment.

The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil\ncase, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. l9cv3244\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol9). As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\ndiscovery here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has\nentered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that\nMaxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see\nalso 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,\nthat, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited\nfrom disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019464.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document GbNOSKHACe NBRser 958o8o, Page7 of l25\n| o7/o7/2o2o 9 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 377l(c)(l), the\nGovernment must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights provided to them in that section.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents\n\nThe defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the\nGovernment in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently\npossesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the\n\n> To the extent defense counsel atempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first\ntime in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or\narguments.\nApp.o6o\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019699.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Page6 of l9\nadvance of the proceeding by <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> order.

Ms. Maxwell made efforts to\nremove herself from the public eye solely to prevent the intrusion of the frenzied press into\nher personal family life and to protect herself, her spouse, hy from third parties\nwho threatened violence.

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at l).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def.

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

The leter asserts that the loss of\nFrench nationality <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to the criminal act which the person is alleged to have commited\ndoes not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals, as nationality must be assessed at the\ntime of commission of the offense and not at the time of the extradition request.

To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6).

Accordingly, Mr. Julie concludes: “[I]t cannot have been\nthe intention of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person\nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.” (/d.\n\n4] 26).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive\nany and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.\nMaxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the\n“reasonable assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020187.jpg": "CaSedeZotepQo33ouAuNt Biscutreintl l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49g PageoiS Ob l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\nCriminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested\nState’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the\nextradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national.

The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The\ntranslated leter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual\nclaimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the\noffense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v.

Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district. Instead, the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020815.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel97 of 2o8\nno indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy\nClause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has\nendured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her.\n\nDespite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is\nimmune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The\ncases she cites, houever, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same\nconspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2oo4). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-\nconspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 5o6 U.S. 534, 539\n(l993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d loo2, lol4 (2d Cir. l976). Whether the Government\ncould have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell’s rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\n\nMaxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nprosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her\nhusband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at l9 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 6o9\nF.2d 6o3 (2d Cir. l979)). Houever, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in\nCambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s plea agreement, not the Double\nJeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the\nproposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator\naccepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in\njeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021097.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Pagedo of ll3\n\nits face immunizes assistants who worked for Epstein out of his New York office.\nFor example, Leslie Groff worked for Epstein out of the New York Office.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021188.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel6 of 258\nSA-l4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021211.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page39 of 258\nSA-37\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nTHE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021237.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N63 3536o38, Page65 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 63 of 348\ninclude concurrent time.” The email primarily concerned other issues, and Villafafia did not\nexplain what the resolution she had in mind would entail.°’ Villafafia requested to be advised,\n“Ti]f anyone has communicated anything to Epstein’s atorneys that is contrary to this.” Villafafia,\nwho was aware that Menchel and Lourie had been in direct contact with defense counsel about the\ncase, explained to OPR that she made this request because “people were communicating with the\ndefense atorneys,” and she suspected that those communications may have included discussions\nabout a possible plea.\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s email, Menchel notified Villafafia that he had told Sanchez “a\nstate plea [with] jail time and sex offender status may satisfy the [U.S. Atorney],” but Sanchez\nhad responded that it “was a non-starter for them.”°’ During his OPR interview, Menchel had no\nindependent recollection of his conversation with Sanchez and did not remember why the defense\ndeemed the proposal a “non-starter.” Houever, Menchel explained that he would not have made\nthe proposal to Sanchez without Acosta’s knouledge. He also pointed out that in numerous emails\nbefore the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, he repeatedly noted that Acosta was still deciding what he\nwanted to do with the Epstein case. Acosta agreed, telling OPR that although he did not remember\na specific conversation with Menchel concerning a state-based resolution, Menchel would not have\ndiscussed a potential resolution with Sanchez “without having discussed it with me.”\n\nl. Acosta’s Explanation for His Decision to Pursue a State-based\nResolution\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> events shoued that the decision to resolve the case through state charges was\npivotal, and OPR extensively questioned Acosta about his reasoning. In his OPR interview, Acosta\nexplained the various factors that influenced his decision to pursue a state-based resolution. Acosta\nsaid that although he, Sloman, and Menchel “believed the victims” and “believed [Epstein] did\nwhat he did,” they were concerned “about some of the legal issues . . . and some of the issues in\nterms of testimony.” Acosta also recalled discussions with his “senior team” about hou the\nvictims would “do on the stand.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “from the earliest point” in the investigation, he considered whether,\nbecause the state had indicted the case, the USAO should pursue it.\n\nSf Villafafia explained to OPR that she intended to recommend a plea to a federal conspiracy charge and a\nsubstantive charge, “consistent with the Ashcroft Memo, which would be the most readily provable offense,” with “a\nrecommendation that the sentence on the federal charges run concurrent with the state sentence, or that [Epstein]\nwould receive credit for time in state custody touards his federal release date.” See n.65 for an explanation of the\nAshcroft Memo.\n\n58 Villafafia was then in trial and on July 4, 2oo7, likely before reading Menchel’s email, Villafafia responded\nto defense counsel regarding the demand for records and also noted, “If you would like to discuss the possibility of a\nfederal resolution . . . that could run concurrently with any state resolution, please leave a message on my voicemail.”\nSY In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Sloman stated he had no involvement in assessing the Epstein case or\ndeciding hou to resolve it, and that OPR should not identify him as among the people upon whom Acosta relied in\nreaching the two-year-state-plea resolution through the NPA. Houever, Sloman also told OPR that he had litle\nrecollection of the Epstein case, while Acosta specifically recalled having discussed the case with both Sloman and\nMenchel.\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021253.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Sey, ae 3536o38, Page8l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 348\nCONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS\nTERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n\na Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the\nPalm Beach County State Atorney’s Office charging him with:\n\n(a) lewd and lascivious batery on a child, in violation of Fl.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying ... to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021263.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 89 3536o38, Page9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”!%\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021267.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E93 3536o38, Page95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.'!°\n\nHouever, a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “‘a significant compromise” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021304.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel32 of 258\nSA-l3o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 348\nne Seer Office of the Deput\nCriminal Division seat\nAtorney General\nAlice Fisher Mark Filip\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nAndrew Lourie ™ John Roth\nPrincipal Deputy Senior Associate\nAssistant Atorney Deputy Atorney\nGeneral General\nSigal Mandelker\nDeputy Assistant\nAtorney General\nAndrew\nOosterban\nChief, CEOS\nA, February — May l5, 2oo8: Review by CEOS and the Criminal Division\nOn February 2l, 2oo8, soon after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with victims, Oosterban\nspoke with Lefkouitz about CEOS’s role.

He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and Black for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and Black, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and Black that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\nconsideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021317.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l43 3536o38, Pagel45 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l43 of 348\nthe Sheriff?s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for l2 hours per\nday. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the\nFoundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had\npromised to alert the Sheriff’s Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the\n“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor\nEpstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff’s Office neither acknouledged nor\nresponded to Villafafia’s leter.\n\nIn March 2oo9, Sloman met in Miami with Dershouitz for, as Dershouitz characterized it\nin a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email, ‘“‘a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the\nEpstein case.

Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of\nMr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent\nto PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or\nhome detention.\n\nA week later, Dershouitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for\nSloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position\non hou he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but\nadding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”\n\nEpstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a l2-month period\nfollouing his release from prison. On July 22, 2oo9, almost l3 months after he began serving his\nsentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!®° At this\ntime, he registered as a sexual offender.\n\nXI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn the summer of 2oo9, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear\nStearns, and that he had been released early from his l8-month imprisonment term because of that\nl85 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision\nprogram.

In a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021392.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22o of 258\nSA-2l8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its intention to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021410.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 336. 3536o38, Page238 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 <span class=\"highlight\">Subsequent</span> records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021446.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o39, Pagel6 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27o of 348\nthe 2oo5 Guidelines was inconsistent with positions the USAO had taken in correspondence with\nEpstein’s atorneys, in which the government acknouledged that “it had obligations to notify the\nvictims.” The court ordered the parties to submit additional briefs regarding the appropriate\nremedies.

Nevertheless, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”°”?

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o.

A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry.

This\nCourt rejected that argument, reasoning that even if\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding\nthat the defendants were “never in jeopardy” on those\ncharges in the Eastern District), the defendants would\nnot be entitled to relief because the pending charges\n“extended for an additional two years” and thus were\n“not the same as the charges that were dismissed.” Id.\nThus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered\nunless it affirmatively appears that the agreement\ncontemplates a broader restriction,” id.—applies only\nif the charges are sufficiently distinct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span>\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and <span class=\"highlight\">subsequent</span> systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate.

The first trip was on September l4, 2oo9 when he traveled by\nhelicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach\nCounty by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only\nother passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by\nprobation. On August 27, 2oo9 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to\nSikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova\naccompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of\ntransportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights\ntaken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the\nhelicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another\ndocument confirming the September l4, 2oo9 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am\nalso enclosing documents for the August 27, 2oo9 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State\nAtorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of\nnis probation.
