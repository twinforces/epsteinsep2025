That money wasn't free,\n\n6 and part of the cause was geting Jane on the plane with them\n\n7 to go to New York where she was sexually abused.

We've already discussed hou you knou that Jane\n\nll traveled from New York from out of state. You knou that from\nl2 Jane's testimony, from Juan Alessi's testimony, and from the\n\nl3 flight records.\n\nl4 The third element is that the defendant intended that\nl5 Jane would engage in sexual activity for which any person can\nl6 be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, and\n\nl7 you're going to learn that it's a crime to engage in sexual\n\nl8 contact with a kid under l7 who is too young to consent. And\nl9 the evidence shous you that Maxwell absolutely intended that\n2o Jane would be abused in New York. That was the whole point of\nal bringing her there, so that Epstein could have access to Jane.\n22 They weren't traveling for mentorship or scholarships, they\n23 weren't traveling with an underage girl because they were\n24 friends, they were geting her to travel so that she could be\n25 molested and that's exactly what happened.
