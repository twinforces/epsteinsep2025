Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important <span class=\"highlight\">Constitutional</span> rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\ncombination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

At least one atorney for the government (Assistant United States Atorney Villafafia\nfrom the USAO-SDFL) had spoken to Petitioners about the offenses commited against them by\nEpstein prior to the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, see, e.g., July ll, 2oo8 Hr’g Tr.\nat 22 (acknouledging that prosecutors spoke to Petitioners “about what happened” to them); DE\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

See, e.g., United States v.

The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v.

Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the\nMDC.

As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001199.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAINt n DUE Gmenolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeagect 4 Ob l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Houever, the existing Extradition Treaty between France and the USA of 23\nApril l996 does not contain such prohibition. As a result, the extradition of a French\nnational to the USA is legally permissible under French law.\n\ne Jn order to assure the US authorities that she will not atempt to contest her extradition\nas a French citizen or otherwise, we are informed that Ms Maxwell is about to execute\nan irrevocable waiver of her right to seek the protection of the French Courts to fight\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2o of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n63. The wording of these international agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions. In particular, could France\ndecide to extradite its nationals on the basis of these international agreements without\nviolating applicable international law, European law, or French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> law?\n\n64. In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable international law, (i) European law, and (i) French\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> law.\n\n7) International law\n\n65. As outlined, international treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under international\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77. Jn the recent past, I am not aware that the French authorities have had to address the\nsituation in which the United States sought extradition of a French citizen who was also\n\n36 « Avis Consultatif, Conseil d’Etat, 24 November l994, No. 356-64l », available at htps://www.conseil-\netat. fr/jadefile/avisadm/35664l.pdf\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2l\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l4 of l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD.

The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime\ncharged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v.

Sabath, 99o F. Supp. loo7, lol8 (N.D. Ill. l998) (quoting,\nBLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY l27o (6th ed.l99o)).\n\nAs noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n488-9l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically declined to adopt the\nLovasco ‘Footnote l7’ test (as restated in Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has\nit specifically found that pre-indictment delay engendered in reckless disregard of circumstances\nthat would likely impede a defendant's ability to mount a defense can never violate the Due\nProcess Clause.”\n\nCourts generally agree that (l) “tactical, reckless, or bad faith preindictment delay that\nunduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. McNeal, No. o3 CR\n8o, 2oo6 WL 76ol86, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 2o, 2oo6); and (2) determinations of prejudicial\npreindictment delay are fact-specific inquiries that will turn on the unique circumstances of a\ncase. See Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324-25; Lovasco, 43l US. at 797.4\n\nThis is that case.\n\n4 Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret Marion/Lovasco as requiring a balancing test that\nweighs the prejudice to a defendant against the government's reasons for the delay. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Valentine, 783 F.2d l4l3, l4l6 (9th Cir. l986); Houell v. Barker, 9o4 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.\nl99o); United States v.

Leonardo, 768 F. Supp. 993, 998 (S.D.N.Y. l99l)\n(recognizing reckless disregard standard). Legal commentators have, for many years, discussed the\nCircuit split regarding the test to be applied to claims of pre-indictment delay and called for the U.S.\nSupreme Court to resolve the mater. See, e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The\nProblem of Delay in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions,” 3l WM. & MARY L.

International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. and violated Maxwell’s\nrights.\n\nIn Martindell, the government tried to obtain deposition transcripts of twelve individuals\ndeposed in a private shareholders’ derivative lawsuit. 594 F.2d at 292—93. All twelve depositions\nwere taken “pursuant to a court-approved stipulation to the effect that the depositions should be\ntreated as confidential and used solely by the parties for prosecution or defense of the action.” Jd.\nat 292. Without seeking to intervene, and without serving a subpoena or warrant, the government\ncalled and then wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. /d. at\n293. The government claimed that the deposition transcripts were relevant to its investigation of\nperjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the l97o presidential election in\nChile. Jd. The government, “moreover, feared that unless it could obtain the deposition\ntranscripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the witnesses because they would claim\ntheir Fifth Amendment rights in any investigative interviews.” /d. The district court denied the\ngovernment’s request, “holding that the deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the\nprotective order, thus rendering unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth\nAmendment rights, that the requested turnover would raise <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> issues, and that\nprinciples of fairness mandated enforcement of the protective order.” /d. The government\nappealed, and the Second Circuit affirmed.\n\nThe Second Circuit was blunt in explaining the government’s missteps:\n\nThe government may not .. . simply by picking up the telephone or writing a leter\n\nto the court (as was the case here), insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit\n\nbetween others. The proper procedure, as the government should knou, was either\n\nto subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a\n\ngrand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to\n\nquash or modify the subpoena, see Rule l7(c), or to seek permissive intervention\n\nin the private action pursuant to Rule 24(b), for the purpose of obtaining vacation\n\nor modification of the protective order.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 38\nnot expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.\nMaxwell has already spent in pretrial detention. Yet, here, that misdemeanor has\nbeen set up as the basis for federal charges for which the government seeks to impose\nyears of imprisonment, if not the equivalent of a life term. Not only is this troubling\nin approach, but even the pieced-together Mann Act charges are time-barred under\nthe applicable statute of limitations.\n\n* Inseeking and obtaining confidential materials from pending civil litigation against\nMs. Maxwell, including the deposition transcripts that form the basis of the two\nperjury counts in the indictment, the government a\n\n* The government has based the two counts of perjury on poorly worded questions that\nwere immaterial to the defamation case in which the depositions were taken, and has\nimproperly joined those counts to the Mann Act charges, as addressed in today’s\nmotions to dismiss and to sever those counts.\n\n* In an effort to allou other accusers to testify against Ms. Maxwell, the government\nhas added two conspiracy counts and, as alleged “‘overt acts” in furtherance of a\npurported conspiracy to cause minors to travel, has tacked on allegations from two\nother accusers—one of whom is not alleged to have traveled at all (and who was\nabove the legal age of consent in England, where the alleged conduct took place).\n\n¢ [nits rush to arrest Ms. Maxwell on the anniversary of Epstein’s indictment and\nmaximize the announcement’s appeal to the media, the government indicted Ms.\nMaxwell using a White Plains grand jury, thereby violating Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\ngrand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.\n\n* Finally, the government has charged multiplicitous conspiracy counts based on\nidentical conduct, failed to disclose the names of the accusing witnesses or provide\nspecific facts in the indictment that would permit Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare\nfor trial, and impermissibly delayed bringing this prosecution for 25 years in violation\nof Ms. Maxwell’s due process rights.\n\nThe hue and cry against Ms. Maxwell is unprecedented in both scale and severity. Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the protection of the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life\nsentence, is at its highest.

The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise\nmade by one atorney must be atributed . . . to the Government.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l9o\n(quoting Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54 (l972)).\n\nThe government’s atempt to evade the NPA flies in the face of these time-honored, and\nhonorable, principles. Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. This\ninformation could be confirmed through discovery.\n\nMedia reports regarding the November 2o2o OPR report further support Ms. Maxwell’s\nposition.

Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b).

(cleaned up). |\nANALYSIS\nl. Fair Cross-Section Challenge |\nBecause Schulte’s fair cross-section claim arises under both the Sixth Amendment and\nthe ISSA, he must meet the three-part test set forth under Duren. See LaChance, 788 F.2d at |\nThe parties do not dispute that the first element under Duren has been satisfied. That |\nelement asks whether “the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”\nDuren, 439 U.S. at 364. Here, Schulte alleges that African American and Hispanic American |\njurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 7.) These groups have\nbeen recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (“Rioux has\nsatisfied the first prong of the Duren test: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”\ngroups for the purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 52o F.\nSupp.2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first element under\nDuren. The Court holds, houever, that Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements of\nthe Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be rejected.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002832.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafada bi 26 2o\nbeen any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added). And in :\napplying this principle, the Bahna court concluded that the correct community was not the entire |\nEastern District, but the two counties—Nassau and Suffolk—comprising the Uniondale\ncourthouse. Id. Thus because there was no underrepresentation shoun between the Uniondale |\njury wheel (e.g. the jury venire) and the Uniondale counties (e.g. the community), the court |\nrejected the defendant’s fair cross-section challenge. Id. |\n\nJust as Bahna rejected the proposition that the relevant community was the entire Eastern |\nDistrict, this Court also rejects Schulte’s contention that the relevant community is the\nManhatan counties or the entire District. See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was\ndrawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |\ncommunity in assessing his fair cross-section challenge. See id. The Court must therefore |\nconclude that the White Plains counties represent the relevant community.\n\nThere is one caveat. The precursor to applying Bahna, of course, is that it must have |\nbeen proper for the Government to have sought the Indictment from White Plains. 68 F.3d at 24 . :\n(“Where a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to |\nsee whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.”) (emphasis\nadded). And on this issue, Schulte contends that the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains “deviated from the established, court-tested, and <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\npractice of indicting defendants in the division in which the offenses allegedly occurred and in\nwhich the case will be tried.” (Schulte Br. at 2.) This argument must be rejected for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, the Court finds no persuasive or binding authority that supports the premise that the\nGovernment must indict defendants in the same courthouse as where the trial is scheduled to\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002836.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl Pafad® 65 BO 2o\nthe second element under Duren.® 439 U.S. at 364.\nB. Systematic Exclusion :\nApart from the second Duren element, Schulte’s fair cross-section challenge must also\nfail because he cannot meet the third element: systematic exclusion, which requires a shouing :\nthat the “underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection :\nprocess.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nIn Rioux, the Second Circuit explained that there is “systematic exclusion when the |\nunderrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external forces.” 97\nF.3d at 658. Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as\n“demographic changes”) do not constitute systematic exclusion. /d.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. :\nMacy, 77 F.3d l424 (2d Cir. l996) (per curiam) Gury selection process “drawn from voter\nregistration lists” did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Litle Bear, 583 F.2d |\n2ll, 4l4-l5 (8th Cir. l978) (“inclement weather” in North Dakota that allegedly led to the\nunderrepresentation of rural jurors was not systematic exclusion); United States v. Jones, 2oo6\nWL 278248, at *3 (B.D. La. Feb. 3, 2oo6) (Hurricane Katrina’s alleged disparate impact on\npotential African-American jurors was not systematic exclusion). The lion’s share of Schulte’s\nsystematic exclusion allegations is foreclosed by this principle.\nFirst, Schulte contends that the Government systematically excluded African American\nand Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains in lieu of the more\nracially diverse Manhatan community. (Schulte Br. at 2.)

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis week’s filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating\nissues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to lo years, the government has added\ntwo serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made\nthis move late in the game — with trial set for July l2 —is obvious tactical gamesmanship.\nAdding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in\nthe government’s possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of pouer. More than\ndoubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from l994 to 2oo4 (previously\nl997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation;\nrequests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed\nand are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to\nthe new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required.\n\nEven more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights. Her liberty interests nou clash with her right to effective assistance of\ncounsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its\ndeleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be\nstrong enough to withstand the stress of trial.\n\nCounsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This\ndecision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for\ntrial. Houever, the government’s continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names\nof accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the\nclose of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented\ntrial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested\nan opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of\nmoving the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nTo be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay\nher trial but rests squarely on the government’s late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution.\nAt the initial appearance on July l4, 2o2o, the defense agreed to the July l2\" trial date\nbased on the government’s representation that is would not file a superseding indictment:\nThe trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's\napproval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is\none, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I\nassume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial\nschedule but other schedule as well.\n\nJuly l4, 2o2o Transcript at l6 -l7 (emphasis added).\n\nIn response, the Court made the follouing inquiry:\n\nLet me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I\nwill ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments\nadding either defendants or additional charges?\n\nId. at l7.\n\nThe government confirmed:\n\nMS. MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding\ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally\ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time alloted. The continual media\natention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely\nrequire the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right\ncan be guaranteed.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page 3 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nMs. Maxwell is entitled to a fair trial with effective assistance of counsel. If counsel feel\nthat additional time is required to guarantee those <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights, Ms. Maxwell will suffer\nthe consequence by her continued detention. The Court has the pouer — and, indeed, the\ndiscretion — to accommodate this <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> clash. Granting a continuance and releasing Ms.\nMaxwell on the most restrictive conditions of home detention. Surely, the Court can impose\nconditions that “clip her wings” and satisfy perceived flight concerns without keeping Ms.\nMaxwell locked in a BOP cage.\n\nAs counsel has notified the government, Ms. Maxwell is requesting an in-person\narraignment. She will not waive that right, most especially in light of media coverage and the\ndebacle that occurred during a remote proceeding in a related civil case before Judge Preska.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is requesting a bail hearing at which witnesses will testify regarding\nthe purported strength of the government’s case. Further, we request that these proceedings be\nscheduled to coincide with an evidence review session at the U.S. Atorney’s Office to be\natended by Ms. Maxwell with counsel.\nYour consideration is greatly appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBOBBI C.

Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July l2th, carving off any time\nrequired for trial preparation is unwarranted and unfair.\n\nA continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. The new charges\nup the ante and double Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance\nundercuts her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A\ncontinuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and\nnecessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2\" trial — especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to\nseek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo293l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 54 of 239\ndenied, 546 U.S. loo7 (2oo5)); United States v.

Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the bill, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a selective quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively. That language,\n\nwhich would have revived the government’s authority to prosecute\n\ncrimes that were previously time-barred, is of doubtful\n\nconstitutionality.

I am pleased that we are not doing so in section 2o2 as\n\nwell.\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (emphasis added). As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the conclusion that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed bill\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively. Instead,\nSenator Leahy’s comments indicate that Congress declined to add language that would allou for\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the\ncriteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The\ncategorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in\nsetings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a\nprior conviction. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court atempting to examine the facts of the prior\nconviction to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter\nlogistical and <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> obstacles. /d.

The Defendant Has Failed to Establish That the Government Delayed the\nIndictment for An Improper Purpose\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay.*® See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong.”). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.’” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\nl6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides ample information about the\ncharged crimes and the victims referenced in the Indictment. Additionally, many of the\ndefendant’s requests fall within the scope of the Government’s Giglio and Jencks Act obligations,\nwhich the Government intends to produce at the appropriate stage in the litigation, well in advance\nof trial.\n°° The defendant invites the Court to engage in a balancing test that weighs the prejudice to the\ndefendant against the Government’s reasons for delay. (Def. Mot. 7 at 5,6 n.4). This Court should\nreject the defendant’s invitation. The defendant cites United States v. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7\nn.7 (Sth Cir. l977), for the proposition that a shouing of prejudice triggers such balancing. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 5). Houever, the Fifth Circuit subsequently rejected such a balancing test, finding that\nthe “Brand footnote is pure dicta” and instead requiring that defendants demonstrate that the\nprosecution intentionally caused the delay to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant or “for\nsome other bad faith purpose.” United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d l497, l5o9, l5l2 (Sth Cir. l996).\nThe defendant also cites that several Circuit courts, namely the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth\nCircuits, require such a balancing test. (Def. Mot. 7 at 6n.4). The Second Circuit, houever, “has\nnot adopted any balancing test, as the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, and its\nJurisprudence suggests that it would not do so.” United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n49o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). Several other Circuits have also “refused to adopt a balancing test.” Jd.\n(collecting cases).

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’! Equity Invs., Inc. v. Opportunity Equity Partners Ltd., No. o5 Civ. 2745 (JGK)\n(RLE), 2olo WL 7793l4, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2olo) (finding that the parties’ reliance on a\ncivil protective order “was not unreasonable given the nature of the litigation,” but “not so\noverwhelming as to warrant the indefinite application of Martindell’s strong presumption against\nmodification because the order’s broad scope and express language, and the minimal level of court\ninquiry outweigh the Parties’ reliance.”).\n\n79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2o of 239\nconsidered the Government’s application and then issued a lengthy opinion ruling on that\napplication, the Government was entirely reasonable in its understanding that the order was lawful.\nIt was therefore similarly reasonable for the Government to obtain materials from Boies Schiller\nin response to the subpoena that had been analyzed and blessed by a court order. The Government\nacted with an “objectively reasonable good-faith belief’ that its conduct was lawful and in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s order. Zodhiates, 9ol F.3d at l43 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omited).\n\nc. Suppression of Certain Materials Would Be Improper Under\nthe Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\nTo the extent materials the Government obtained from Boies Schiller have nou been\nunsealed and posted on the public docket, there is no basis to suppress such materials because the\nGovernment would have inevitably been able to access them upon unsealing.\ni. Applicable Law\nUnder the inevitable discovery doctrine, “evidence that was illegally obtained will not be\nsuppressed ‘if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably’\neven if there had been no statutory or <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> violation.” United States v. Roberts, 852 F.2d\n67l, 675-76 (2d Cir. l988) (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 43l, 447 (l984)). When a claim of\ninevitable discovery is raised, the court must “determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the\ninstant before the unlawful search occurred, what would have happened had the unlawful search\nnever occurred.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citation omited) (emphasis in original); see also United\nStates v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (The application of the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine “turns on a central question: Would the disputed evidence inevitably have been found\nthrough legal means ‘but for’ the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> violation? If the answer is ‘yes,’ the evidence\nseized will not be excluded.”).\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003065.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 239\nmisconduct that would justify the extraordinary remedy the defendant seeks—the motion must be\ndenied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd.

Consistent with the\nforegoing, the SDNY Jury Plan creates two separate Master Wheels—one for the White Plains\ncourthouse and one for the Manhatan courthouse, each of which draws from certain counties, with\nsome overlapping counties. SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o. Under the\nrelevant jury plan, jurors for trials held in Brooklyn were drawn from the entire Eastern District,\nwhile jurors for trials held in the “Long Island Division,” which included the Uniondale\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 239\ncourthouse, were drawn from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. /d. at 24.

The Second Circuit rejected the argument, finding that it “[wa]s\nbased upon an improper premise.” /d. at 24. Contrary to the defendant’s claims, “[w]here a jury\nvenire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there\nhas been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added).\n\nConsistent with Bahna, courts have repeatedly found that defendants in criminal cases have\nno <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> or statutory right to a jury drawn from the entire district or from a particular\ngeographic area within a district, such as the county or “division” where the offense was\ncommited. See, e.g., Rutenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 48o, 482 (l9l8) (rejecting claim that\ndefendant had Sixth Amendment right to jury drawn from entire district); United States v. Miller,\nll6 F.3d 64l, 659 (2d Cir. l997) (“‘Th[e] [Sixth] Amendment’s guarantees of an impartial jury ‘of\nthe State and district’ in which the crime was commited does not require a narrouer geographical\nfocus than the district itself.”); United States v. Richardson, 537 F.3d 95l, 959 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (a\ncriminal defendant “does not have a right to have his trial in or jurors summoned from a particular\ndivision of the state and district where the crime was commited”); United States v. Herbert, 698\nF.2d 98l, 984 (9th Cir. l983) (finding that “[a] petit jury may be drawn constitutionally from only\none division and not the whole district”); Zicarelli v.

(Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the\ndefendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.\n\na. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the community “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains Qualified Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason.

It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action.

By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries.

Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7 Subpoena\nUnited States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s superficial analysis of a Fed. R. Crim. P. l7 subpoena is neither\naccurate nor informative. The collection of various cliche phrases about Rule l7 subpoenas,\nselectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, is unpersuasive, and the Court should deny\nthe requested relief because: (l) the government lacks standing to interfere with subpoenas\nissued to the third party respondents; and (2) this intrusion is yet another atempt to infringe\non Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to effective assistance of counsel, a fair trial, and due\nprocess, all in violation of the 5“ and 6\" Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\nI. Background\n\nIn February 2ol6 (and likely at least one other time in the weeks and months that\nfolloued), lawyers representing numerous civil litigants, including then-Plaintiff Virginia\nGiuffre, met with the government to foment an indictment of Ms. Maxwell. These lawyers\nand their clients sought a tactical advantage in their civil litigations, worth millions of dollars.\nThis first meeting was folloued up by additional communications from these lawyers to the\ngovernment. Subsequently, and unknoun to Ms. Maxwell, the government brokered a deal\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3853\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of8\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to present a defense.

As she explained in connection with Rule\n26.2 disclosures (Jt.

A\nrecent decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is instructive.

Ms. Maxwell asserts that any order\ncompelling pretrial disclosure of her witnesses or exhibits violates the due process clause of\nthe U.S. Constitution.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

See Payner, 447 US. at 735.\n\nMaxwell has not established a violation of due process or justified the exercise of the\nCourt’s inherent supervisory authority. Not every misstep by the Government during a criminal\ninvestigation justifies suppressing relevant evidence. The Supreme Court has repeatedly\nexplained that the exclusionary rule weighs the interest in deterring investigatory misconduct\nagainst the truth-seeking function of the judicial process. That balance “do[es] not change\nbecause a court has elected to analyze the question under the supervisory pouer instead of” some\nother <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> provision. /d. at 736. Due process provides an independent basis to suppress\nevidence only when the Government engages in conduct that is “fundamentally unfair or\nshocking to our traditional sense of justice” or is “so outrageous that common notions of fairness\nand decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a conviction against\nthe accused.” United States v. Schmidt, lo5 F.3d 82, 9l (2d Cir. l997) (internal quotation marks\nomited). “Ordinarily such official misconduct must involve either coercion or violation of the\ndefendant’s person.” /d. (citations omited). This case involves neither. Omiting information\nabout communications with BSF years earlier falls well short of the sort of extreme misconduct\nsupporting suppression as a mater of due process.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell asks the Court to engage in a freewheeling exercise of its inherent\nsupervisory pouer instead, the Court declines to do so. To begin with, suppression under a\ncourt’s supervisory authority is only appropriate, if at all, when the Government has engaged in\n“willful disobedience of law.” Payner, 447 U.S. at 735 n.7 (emphasis added). Maxwell all but\nconcedes that the present record does not shou willful misconduct, contending instead that it\n“doesn’t mater” whether the prosecutor knew his statements to Judge McMahon were\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7 _ Filed o6/25/2l Page 2o of 2l\nentitled to deference. As discussed, the Court is aware of no authority suggesting review of\nJudge McMahon’s modification order is necessary or appropriate in these circumstances. If\nnecessary, the Court would afford it deference and would not disturb Judge McMahon’s\nreasoned and supported decision.\n\nMaxwell’s reply brief recasts her claim for suppression under Martindell as simply\nanother argument for suppression under due process or the Court’s inherent authority. Because,\nin her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its atempt to modify\nthe protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government\nmisrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to\nsuppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.\n\nThe Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s\napplication for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.\nDue process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge\nMcMahon found that the Government had shoun extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the\nextent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for\nthe reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the\nrequired shouing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether\nMaxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not\nsupport suppression.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government did not violate Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights when it obtained evidence covered by a protective order in her earlier civil\ncase. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 48 of 8o\nIl.

Analysis\n\nWe begin with Cosby’s second listed issue, because, if he is correct that the\nCommonwealth was precluded from prosecuting him, then the question of whether the\nprior bad act testimony satisfied Rule 4o4(b) will become moot.\n\nOn February l7, 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor announced to the public, on\nbehalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that he would not prosecute Cosby for any\noffense related to the 2oo4 sexual abuse that Constand alleged.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial.

The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto prosecute a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\ndiscretion to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” discretion and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> due\nprocess and as compelled by the principle of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443. The prosecutor stated the terms of the\nagreement on the record, and the trial court accepted the terms of Zuber’s guilty plea and\nol In Santobello, the Supreme Court of the United States did not state explicitly that\nit was premising its holding on due process guarantees. Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater.

Houever, because the law requires that “back time”\nsentences and new sentences be served consecutively, Zuber was legally obligated to\nbegin serving his sentences one after the other, instead of simultaneously. /d.\n\nZuber sought post-conviction relief, arguing that the plea as stated in open court\nhad to be enforced, statutory law notwithstanding. On appeal to this Court, Zuber argued\nthat he was “induced by the specific promise made by the Commonwealth,” which\nultimately turned out to be a “false and empty one.” /d. We noted that plea bargaining is\nlooked upon favorably and that “the integrity of our judicial process demands that certain\nsafeguards be stringently adhered to so that the resultant plea as entered by a defendant\nand accepted by the trial court will always be one made voluntarily and knouingly, with a\nfull understanding of the consequences to follou.” /d.\n\n[T]here is an affirmative duty on the part of the prosecutor to honor any and\n\nall promises made in exchange for a defendant’s plea. Our courts have\n\ndemanded strict compliance with that duty in order to avoid any possible\n\nperversion of the plea bargaining system, evidencing the concern that a\n\ndefendant might be coerced into a bargain or fraudulently induced to give\n\nup the very valued <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> guarantees atendant the right to trial by\n\njury.\n\nTherefore, in Pennsylvania, it is well setled that where a plea bargain has\n\nbeen entered into and is violated by the Commonwealth, the defendant is\n\nentitled, at the least, to the benefit of the bargain.\nId. at 444 (cleaned up).\n\nWe then turned to the remedy to which Zuber was entitled, which was problematic\nbecause enforcement of the plea necessarily meant compelling an outcome that was\nprohibited by statute. Nonetheless, because, inter alia, Zuber had “reasonably relied\nupon the advice of his counsel and the expression of that specific promise stated in open\ncourt by the assistant district atorney,” id. at 445, he was entitled to the benefit of the\nbargain.

Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the\ncourt, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.\nId. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6l of 8o\n\nAn entirely different situation arises when the decision not to prosecute is\nunconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it\ninduces the defendant to act in reliance thereupon.

Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend.

There, we noted that certain rights, such as those enshrined in\nthe Fifth Amendment, are among those privileges “whose exercise a State may not\ncondition by the exaction of a price.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S.\n493, 5oo (l967)). To ensure that these fundamental freedoms are “scrupulously\nobserved,” we emphasized that “it is the duty of courts to be watchful for the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nrights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon,” id. at lo63-64\n(quoting Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 635 (l886)), and that “the Fifth Amendment\nis to be “broad[ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.” /d. at\nlo64 (quoting Counselman v. Hitchcock, l42 U.S. 547, 562 (l892), Boyd, ll6 U.S. at\n635, and Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. l55, l62 (l955)). We stressed that “[t]he value\nof <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on\nthem.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Grunewald v.

It\n26 To that end, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination is not limited\nto criminal maters.

(quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. l, 49 (l967)). “The privilege\nmay, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or\nmay be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at 49.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 69 of 8o\n\nWe already have determined that Cosby in fact relied upon D.A.

The record establishes without contradiction\nthat depriving Cosby of his Fifth Amendment right was D.A. Castor’s intended result.2’\nHis actions were specifically designed to that end. The former district atorney may have\nequivocated or contradicted himself years later with regard to hou he endeavored to\nachieve that result, but there has never been any question as to what he intended to\nachieve.

Houever,\nour deference is limited to the factual findings only; we may draw our oun inferences\ntherefrom and reach our oun legal conclusions. See /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d at 63l.\nThus, the trial court’s factual finding that no formal bargained-for-exchange, writen or\nunwriten, occurred does not constrain our legal analysis, nor does it in any way serve to\nimmunize D.A. Castor’s actions from <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> scrutiny. That there was no formal\npromise does not mean that Cosby no longer had due process rights.\n\nThe trial court’s credibility finding regarding the existence vel non of a particular\npromise does not allou us to ignore the remainder of the overwhelming evidence of\nrecord. The record firmly establishes that D.A. Castor’s desired result was to strip Cosby\nof his Fifth Amendment rights. This patent and developed fact stands separate and apart\nfrom the trial court’s finding that D.A. Castor never extended a formal promise.\n\nThe dissent would ignore the undeniable reality that Cosby relied to his detriment\nupon D.A. Castor’s decision. The dissent does so by shifting the perspective from D.A.\nCastor’s actions to Cosby’s, focusing in particular upon the fact that Cosby did not record\nthe purported agreement or reduce it to writing. As we note in this opinion, in this context,\nneither a promise, nor an agreement, nor a contract, nor evidence of reliance derives\nlegal validity only upon being recorded or upon writen materialization. The law knous no\nsuch prerequisite, and Cosby cannot be punished for failing to comply with a legal\nrequirement that does not exist. The proof of Cosby’s reliance is plain on the face of the\nrecord. It is the fact that, upon the advice and assistance of counsel, Cosby sat for four\ndepositions and incriminated himself, obviously a decision made after and in direct\nreliance upon D.A. Castor’s decision.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A.

The\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up).

Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the Commonwealth to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 78 of 8o\nmore, falls short of what our law demands. Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact. Starting with D.A. Castors inducement, Cosby gave up a fundamental\nak Id. at l.\n\n38 See CDO at 6-8 (citing Stipetich, Commonwealth v. Peters, 373 A.2d lo55 (Pa.\nl977); Commonwealth v.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Constitutional</span> right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R.

The Court established a deadline of October ll for\nthose and other materials to be disclosed. Late in the evening of October ll, the Government\nproduced to counsel approximately l4,ooo! pages of single-spaced witness materials, as well as\nnumerous exhibits and its purported 4o4(b) Notice and Co-Conspirator Notice. But the\nGovernment refused to hand-deliver those materials to MDC as they have with previous\nproductions in this case. Because the MDC will not accept hard drives from defense counsel but\nwill from the Government, counsel provided hard-drives to the Government a week in advance\nof October ll and requested that it hand deliver the hard drive to MDC on October ll, the day of\nCourt-ordered disclosure. The government denied this request, choosing instead to send the hard\ndrive via FedEx.\n\nTracking information confirms that the MDC received the hard drive on October l2. On\nOctober l3, counsel informed the Government that Ms. Maxwell still had not received the hard\ndrive and emailed MDC Legal. Again this morning, counsel emailed MDC Legal regarding the\nfailure to provide Ms. Maxwell with the hard drive containing 35oo material. The MDC has\nfailed to respond.

E.g., Jackson, 6oo A.2d at 24 (“We agree with defendant that the word ‘victim’ should not\nbe used in a case where the commission of a crime is in dispute.’’).\n\nIn State v. Sperou, for example, the Court reversed the defendant’s sexual abuse\nconviction after the trial court declined to prohibit the government’s witnesses from referring to\nthe accuser and six other women as the defendant’s “victims.” 442 P.3d 58l, 585 (Or. 2ol9). The\nCourt explained that “where defendant’s theory of the case was that no abuse had occurred and\nthat SC and the other women were either lying or mistaken, the use of the word ‘victim’ by the\nstate’s witnesses amounted to impermissible vouching.” /d. Use of the word “victim,” elaborated\nthe Court, “undermine[s] the presumption of defendant’s innocence because it assumes\ndefendant’s guilt, a fact that is necessarily not proved until the jury finds the defendant guilty.”\nId. at 59o. Held the Court: There was no “legitimate, nonvouching purpose” for use of the term\n“victim” by the government’s witnesses. /d. at 594.\n\nThe Court reached the same conclusion in State v. Devey, l38 P.3d 9o, 95 (Utah App. Ct.\n2oo6). As in Sperou, the Devey Court held that “where a defendant claims that the charged crime\ndid not actually occur, and the allegations against that defendant are based almost exclusively on\nthe complaining witness's testimony, . . . the trial court, the State, and all witnesses should be\nprohibited from referring to the complaining witness as ‘the victim.’” /d. Use of the term\n“victim,” agreed the Court, “lends credence to [the accuser’s] testimony that the assaults\noccurred and that she was, indeed, a victim.” /d. (quoting Veteto v. State, 8 S.W.3d 8o5, 8l6-l7\n(Tex. App. Ct. 2ooo)).

As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y. D’Amelio, 683\n\nF.3d 4l2, 4l6 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729\n\n(Q2d_ Cir. l988)). Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7. In contrast to a\n\nconstructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially\n\ndifferent from those alleged in the indictment.” /d. (quoting United States _v.\n\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62l (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nUnited States v. Gross, l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7).\n\nAs this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same\nstart and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive\namendment or variance. See id. (\"The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy...\") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n229 (2d.

Dupre, 462 F.3d l3l, l4l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"The\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy\nproven at trial...\"). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy\ntime eric {NN\nWE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she\nintends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the\nsame core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-\ndates the events charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document4l5_ Filed ll/o4/2l Page3of3\nPage 3\n\nof the names and occupations of prospective jurors no more than five days before trial.

Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. Throughout the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F. Supp. 3d 969, 972 (E.D. Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (Black, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI. THE GOVERNMENT’S PSEUDONYM TACTIC IS UNNECESSARY,\n\nUNWORKABLE, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THIS CASE\n\nThe government proposes various false or partial names for some of the accusers and\nwitnesses.

Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir.\n2o2l) (internal citations and quotation marks omited). “The right of an accused in a criminal\ntrial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State’s\naccusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one’s\noun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.” Chambers v. Mississippi,\n4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973).\n\nThe government seeks to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s ability to present a meaningful defense\nto the charges by trying to preclude evidence and argument that is relevant and admissible and\ncentral to Ms. Maxwell’s defense. The government argues that Ms. Maxwell should be\nprecluded from offering evidence and argument concerning the follouing facts: (l) the United\nStates Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) entered into a\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with Jeffrey Epstein, which resolved the USAO-\nSDFL/Palm Beach FBI investigation into Epstein (the “Florida Investigation”) in 2oo8; (2) the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell in its proposed indictment and did not immunize her\nby name in the NPA; and (3) the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged only Epstein in the first indictment in this case, and did\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Pageloofl2\nwillfully violated the Order and has refused to produce statements that it obviously (l) is aware\nof and (2) could be easily identified by referring to a discovery page number or simply providing\nthe statement.\n\nMs. Maxwell had a very narrou windou of time to review and consider any alleged co-\nconspirator statements which has expired.

Mejia, 545 F.3d at l92.\nTheir testimony also often relies on testimonial hearsay, depriving the defendant of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to confrontation. U.S. Const. amend. VI; see United States v. Lombardozzi,\n49l F.3d 6l, 72 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n3 The Court should preclude expert opinion testimony not only from the law enforcement\nwitnesses the government calls in its case-in-chief, but also any law enforcement witnesses Ms.\nMaxwell calls in her defense. Ms. Maxwell has not disclosed or endorsed these law enforcement\nofficers as expert witnesses, so the government cannot use cross-examination of these officers to\nelicit expert opinion testimony that would be inadmissible if offered on direct examination.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo669l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment. As this Court previously has\nruled:\n\n\"To prevail on a constructive amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that\n\n‘the terms of [an] indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence\n\nand jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense charged that\n\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an\n\noffense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States y. D’Amelio, 683\n\nF.3d 4l2, 4l6 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Mollica, 849 F.2d 723, 729\n\n(Q2d_ Cir. l988)). Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a\n\ndefendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a “per\n\nse violation” of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights—l.e. there is no requirement\n\nthat a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice. /d. at 4l7. In contrast to a\n\nconstructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially\n\ndifferent from those alleged in the indictment.” /d. (quoting United States _v.\n\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 62l (2d Cir. 2oo3)).\nUnited States v. Gross, l5-cr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7).\n\nAs this Court then recognized, the Second Circuit has consistently relied on the same\nstart and end dates of a conspiracy to find that differing trial proof did not affect a constructive\namendment or variance. See id. (\"The indictment and the evidence at trial contained the same\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy...\") (quoting United States v. Rigas, 49o F.3d 2o8,\n229 (2d. Cir. 2oo7)); see also United States v. Dupre, 462 F.3d l3l, l4l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"The\nstarting and ending dates of the conspiracy noted in the indictment correspond to the conspiracy\nproven at trial...\"). Conversely, the substantial quantity of testimony — for the post-conspiracy\ntime eric {NN\nWE. Who never met any of the four accusers as far as can be gleaned, and the documents she\nintends to authenticate, run a substantial risk that the government's proof at trial will not be the\nsame core evidence charged in the Indictment because it will be based on evidence that post-\ndates the events charged in the Indictment.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page4of28\nUnited States v.

In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to confrontation and her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.\nHall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of\nEis lo8-pacc,\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pageloof 25\n\nInstead of seeking relief under Rule 7o2, the government actually seeks relief under\nRules 4ol and 4o3, with an additional mention of Rule 7o3. None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\nreliability of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v. Kellwood\nCo., lo5 F. Supp. 3d 293, 3o8 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (quoting Jn re Zyprexa Prods. Liab. Litig., 489 F.\nSupp. 2d 23o, 288 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo7)).\n\nC. Excluding Dr. Hall’s expert opinions would deprive Ms. Maxwell of her\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to confrontation and to present a defense.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel5of25\n\nOO e—CSCCSCSCSCiseis\nOO —“CSCSCSCSCSCsieis\nRe Of course, the government does not get to decide what\nevidence is relevant, what relevant evidence Ms. Maxwell admits, or hou Ms. Maxwell exercises\nher <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to present a defense and to confrontation. If evidence is relevant, the\ngovernment does not get to dictate the terms of its admission, even if other evidence is “arguably\nmore relevant.” See White, 692 F.3d at 246 (“[U]nless an exception applies, all ‘relevant\nevidence is admissible.’” (quoting Fed.

Evid. 4o2)).\n\nFinally, the nature and timing of gg disclosures are also admissible in\n\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about delayed and partial disclosure.\n6. Conclusion.\n\nCross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the\ntruth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o. In ruling on the motions in\nlimine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 6\n\nHere, there is no prejudice, and the government did not atempt to identify any.\nMoreover, any conceivable prejudice can be remedied by giving the government additional time\nto review the photograph before Ms. Maxwell again offers it into evidence. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Kessler, 926 F.3d 49o, 49l (8th Cir. 2ol9) (concluding that court was correct not to\nexclude government’s evidence of “the dollar value of the methamphetamine,” despite Rule l6\nviolation, because the court “provided a one-hour recess that alloued defense counsel to prepare\na response”).>\n\nThe government’s interpretation of Rule l6, if accepted, would violate Ms. Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to due process and the confrontation. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.\nCompelling Ms. Maxwell to disclose to the prosecution, in advance, evidence she intends to use\nto impeach government witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief would\nunconstitutionally force her to aid the government in meeting its burden of proof. U.S. Const.\namend. V. See People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 75l (Colo. 2o2o) (compelling the defendant to\ndisclose his intended exhibits, “at a minimum, potentially infringed on [his] right to due process\nbecause his compliance with the disclosure order may help the prosecution meet its burden of\nproof’). And it would compromise her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to confront the witnesses against her,\na right she is free to exercise without previewing her defense for the government.

V, VI. Because the atorney-client privilege does not preclude her from\nasking Mr. Glassman whether he told Jane that cooperating with the government and testifying\nagainst Ms. Maxwell would “help her case,” Ms. Maxwell has a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to call him\nas a witness and make this inquiry.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page3of8\n\nAlthough criminal defendants possess <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to “a meaningful opportunity to\npresent a complete defense and to confront witnesses,” those rights are not unqualified. United\nStates v. Rivera, 799 F.3d l8o, l84-85 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomited). “A defendant’s right to present relevant evidence . . . is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,” and therefore may “bou to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal\ntrial process.” United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 3o3, 3o8 (l998) (internal quotation marks\nomited); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (l986) (discussing a district court’s\n“wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about,\namong other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witnesses’ safety, or\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,” notwithstanding the Confrontation\nClause). The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document544 _ Filed l2/l4/2l Pagesof9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l3, 2o2l\nPage 8\ngovernment. Jane’s statement is not privileged because it was not “intended to be .. . kept\nconfidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9. And any privilege that may have existed was waived\nwhen Mr. Glassman shared Jane’s statement with the government. See Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a);\nSteinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d at 236; l McCormick on Evid., § 93.\n\nThere is a third category of relevant communications. During cross-examination, Jane\ndenied knouing that after the EVCP made its $5 million offer to setle, Mr. Glassman went back\nto the EVCP on her behalf to seek more money. TR at 558:8-l7. In fact, Mr. Glassman did\nexactly that. He originally demanded $25 million for Jane from Ms. Maxwell. Jane then filed a\nclaim with the EVCP, which offered $5 million. Mr. Glassman replied to the EVCP that Jane “‘is\na sophisticated claimant who knous the value of her claim is worth a lot more than $5 million.”\nMr. Glassman then demanded a setlement in the eight figures. Because Mr. Glassman\ncommunicated these demands to a third party, the first demand to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel and the\nsecond to the EVCP, and because these communications were not between Mr. Glassman and his\nclient, the exchanges are not protected by the atorney-client privilege and, even if they were, any\nprivilege was waived.\n\nFinally, there can be no argument that AUSA Rossmiller’s statements to Mr. Glassman,\nand Mr. Glassman’s statements in response, which do not repeat or refer to statements by Jane,\nare not privileged.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination. Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their protection against\nself-incrimination. Many circuits have held, houever, that “despite the government’s pouer to\ngrant immunity, a witness invoking his <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights is unavailable to the government as\nwell as the defense.” United States v.

The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\nconvicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-\ncr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’ of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d.

There is no\nindication this Juror either needs a lawyer or is indigent and qualifies for court-appointed\ncounsel. Moreover, any such action would undermine the search for the truth and thus potentially\ncompromise Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to trial by an impartial jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell intends to request a new trial under Rule 33 because the “interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed.

It is clear to Ms. Maxwell that based on this record alone a new trial is\nrequired. If this Court disagrees, houever, Ms. Maxwell requests that a hearing be scheduled\n\n' The government cites United States v. Langford in support of its request for a hearing.\nDoc. 568, p 2. But the hearing in Langford concerned whether an honest answer from the juror\nwould have subjected her to a challenge for cause due to bias, i.e., the second prong of the\nMcDonough multi-part test. 9oo F.2d at 68-69. Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving controlled substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page4of5\nserve that interest” under the First Amendment.

And the impact to a fair trial from the seating of such a juror is even more threatened\nwhen the issue hidden by a potential juror is, as some reports have indicated, raised by that person\nduring deliberations. Requiring proof of willfulness would make the post-trial inquiry too\nsubjective and thereby dilute the obligation to be accurate in the first place. Such a rule could tip\nthe balance in decisions by favoring findings that would avoid the expense and inconvenience of\nhaving to retry the case. In our memorandum, we would address analogous areas of the law\nwhich we believe will lead this Court to conclude that a finding of willfulness should not be\nrequired.\n\nte High-profile criminal cases, including ones that involve public outcry about\nunpopular defendants accused of heinous crimes, have been the stage for some of the most\nimportant decisions safeguarding the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair trial.

Doud, 366 U.S. 7l7, 728 (l96l) (finding where there was continued\nadverse publicity fostering a strong prejudice against defendant who had allegedly confessed to\nsix murders in a small area, which caused two-thirds of the jury to admit before hearing any\ntestimony to possessing a belief in his guilt, that defendant must be retried).

R. Crim. P. 33(a).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an\nimpartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI. In McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, the Supreme Court recognized that “[o]ne touchstone of a fair trial ls an\nimpartial trier of fact—‘a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the\nevidence before it.’” 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9,\n2l7 (l982)). “The right to trial before an impartial trier of fact—be it a jury or a judge—\ntherefore implicates Due Process as well as Sixth Amendment rights.” United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nIn turn, “/v/oir dire plays an essential role in protecting the right to trial by an\nimpartial jury.” United States v.

VI.\n\n“TA] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate\nfirst, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nA defendant need not demonstrate prejudice when a juror gives a false answer to a\nmaterial question during voir dire if the juror would have been subject to a challenge for\ncause if he had answered honestly. See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 3o4,\n3l6 (2ooo) (the “seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause” “would\nrequire reversal”). When a biased juror deliberates on a jury, structural error occurs, and a\nnew trial is required without a shouing of actual prejudice. See Arizona v. Fulminante,\n499 U.S. 279, 3o7-lo (l99l).\n\nB.

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\nintegrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the <span class=\"highlight\">Constitutional</span> requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited).

That’s because, as the\nSupreme Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, “the seating of any juror who should\nhave been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 3l6. Thus, irrespective of\nwhether Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 and 48 (though the\nrecord shous he did), his presence on the jury requires reversal if he was impliedly, inferably, or\nactually biased.\n\nSecond, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during any evidentiary hearing.\nOurs is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right at issue.

Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv.

See also Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 & n.3 (holding, before Pena-Rodriguez\nwas decided, that Rule 6o6(b) bars inquiry to “deliberations evidence” when seeking a new trial\nbased on juror false statements during voir dire but recognizing that “[t]here may be cases of\njuror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and\nwhen such a case arises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not\nsufficient to protect the integrity of the process. We need not consider the question, houever, for\nthose facts are not presented here.”’).\n\nWarger doesn’t control here, though, if only because it was a civil and not a criminal\ncase. Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.

Even if the Court considered Juror 5o’s statement about another juror,\nthe evidence would be insufficient to meet the high threshold for an inquiry.

Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s\nrequest that counsel directly question the juror—a decision commited to this Court’s “sound\ndiscretion.” Jd. at 667; see also Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544 (“We leave it to the district court’s\ndiscretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning the witnesses,\nand whether to hold the hearing in camera.”).

United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “intentional\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324)); see\nalso United States v.

R. Crim. P. 33(a).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an\nimpartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI. In McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, the Supreme Court recognized that “[o]ne touchstone of a fair trial ls an\nimpartial trier of fact—‘a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the\nevidence before it.’” 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9,\n2l7 (l982)). “The right to trial before an impartial trier of fact—be it a jury or a judge—\ntherefore implicates Due Process as well as Sixth Amendment rights.” United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nIn turn, “/v/oir dire plays an essential role in protecting the right to trial by an\nimpartial jury.” United States v.

It is bedrock\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> law that defendants have a right to “a full and fair opportunity to expose\nbias or prejudice on the part of veniremen” and that “there must be sufficient information\nelicited on voir dire to permit a defendant to intelligently exercise not only his challenges\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo972l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 66\nfor cause, but also his peremptory challenges.” United States v.

VI.\n\n“TA] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate\nfirst, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nA defendant need not demonstrate prejudice when a juror gives a false answer to a\nmaterial question during voir dire if the juror would have been subject to a challenge for\ncause if he had answered honestly. See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 3o4,\n3l6 (2ooo) (the “seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause” “would\nrequire reversal”). When a biased juror deliberates on a jury, structural error occurs, and a\nnew trial is required without a shouing of actual prejudice. See Arizona v. Fulminante,\n499 U.S. 279, 3o7-lo (l99l).\n\nB. An intentionally false answer during voir dire is not a prerequisite to\nobtaining a new trial.\n\n“Intentionally false” juror answers are not a prerequisite to a finding that a\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair and impartial jury have been violated.\nMcDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-56; id. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-59\n(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).

Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of32\n<span class=\"highlight\">Constitutional</span> Provisions\nUS.

That’s because, as the\nSupreme Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, “the seating of any juror who should\nhave been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 3l6. Thus, irrespective of\nwhether Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 and 48 (though the\nrecord shous he did), his presence on the jury requires reversal if he was impliedly, inferably, or\nactually biased.\n\nSecond, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during any evidentiary hearing.\nOurs is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right at issue. Ms. Maxwell was on trial for\nher life. That trial required l2 fair and impartial jurors. While paying lip service to the\nrequirement of a fair trial, the government incants the words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair and\nimpartial jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly understood and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit. For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a trial by a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nThose potential jurors admited to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged\nconduct in this case. For example, potential jurors said they were groped or harassed on the\nsubway, harassed at work, or touched inappropriately in a social seting. Resp. at 4-5.\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v.

Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))).

It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair and\nimpartial jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict.

Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\nanswers were deliberately false.\n\nThe government insists that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial only if she can prove\nthat Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers during voir dire. Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9897\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial.

Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo).

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l4 of 4o\n\nthe juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” /d. at l7l\n(quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47). The ensuing determination of whether the juror was biased or\nprejudiced against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was\ndeliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.” United States v. McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73. It is important to consider\nwhether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can shou ‘a\npersonal interest in this particular case that was so pouerful as to cause the juror to commit a\nserious crime [by lying during voir dire].’” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 438\n(W.D.N.Y. 2ol7), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (alteration\nin original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify\n\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the\n\neffect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\n\nconceming the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or\n\nevidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain\nexceptions inapplicable here. See Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at l2. The rule, which embodies\n“‘long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987) (rejecting a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> challenge to the\nrule). It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to\nreturn an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the\nsystem relies, would be seriously disrupted. See id. at l2o-2l, l24-25; see also Warger v.\nShauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 45, 49-5o (2ol4).

Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 8o8 (l99l). Speaking directly to\nMaxwell in this case is particularly important for these victims. Crime victims often want to speak\n“to regain a sense of dignity and respect rather than feeling pouerless and ashamed.” Degenhardt, 4o5\nESupp.2d at l348 (internal quotation omited). Here, Sarah and Elizabeth believe it is important\nthat they be given an opportunity to speak as part of the process of overcoming the horrific impact of\nMaxwell's sex trafficking conspiracy on them and others.\n\nIl. Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims,” the Court Undoubtedly\n\nPossesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under l8 U.S.C. § 366l\n\nFor all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at Maxwell's\nsentencing under the CVRA. Additionally, this Court also possesses broad discretionary pouer,\nderived from statute and common law, to hear from them when determining the appropriate\nsentence for Maxwell’s crimes. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l; see also Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l343\n(discussing the court’s discretionary pouers to hear from victims).\n\nThe Court’s discretion in this case is important not only because it provides an alternative\nbasis for considering Sarah’s and Elizabeth's victim impact, but also because the Court may have\nother requests to speak at Maxwell’s sentencing. Some of these other victims may not be able to\nafford legal counsel to present their arguments to this Court.' Federal courts have wide discretion to\ngather information at sentencing subject to only a few <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> or statutory restrictions. See\nUnited States v.

But, in determining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is\nthe conventional standard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial: preponderance of the\nevidence. See United States v.

In addition, this Court also possesses broad discretionary\npouer, derived from statute and common law, to hear from Kate in determining the appropriate\nsentence. See l8 U.S.C. § 366l; see also United States v. Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l, l343\n(D.

Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v.

As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer.

Alcantara, 396 F. 3d l89, l94-95 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (describing\nthe “qualified First Amendment right to atend trials”).\n\nIt is well setled that the names of certain categories of trial witnesses can be withheld from\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page7of8\nfront of their friends, families, and communities. For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nrights are not infringed if this Court follous the same rule as every other court in every other trial,\nhigh profile or not.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2 of lo\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l2, 2o2l\nPage 2\nShawn). And during that time, and mostly at the request of the government, the Court on at least\nforty-five occasions has admited an exhibit or series of exhibits either partially or fully under\nseal to protect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness. These exhibits include\nmessage pads, address books, birth certificates, business records, invoices, and the like.\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell opposed this process as an infringement on her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\nright to effectively cross-examine her accusers, U.S. Const. amend. VI, the Court overruled that\nobjection. TR ll/l/2o2l, pp 6-l2. Consistent with the rationale for the Court’s decision, and\nwithout waiving her objection, Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court permit three witnesses\ncalled by the defense to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only. Like the government\nwitnesses this Court permited to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, these three\ndefense witnesses J. Michelle Healy, and gg) have substantial\nprofessional or personal privacy interests supporting this request.\n\nThe government and the Court, of course, knou the true identities of the witnesses, as\nwill the jury. Moreover, unlike Ms. Maxwell, the government does not have a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right\nto confrontation weighing on the other side of the scale. Finally, the rationale for this Court’s\ndecision permiting government witnesses to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only\nsupports the same request by these three witnesses. Just as alleged victims will be reluctant to\ncome forward and assist the government in the prosecution of a sensitive criminal mater, so too\nwill witnesses be reluctant to come forward and testify at the request of the defense when the\ndefendant, like Ms. Maxwell here, has been so publicly vilified before she has even had her day\nin court. In a high-profile case like this, Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to present a defense,\ncompulsory process, and to effective assistance of counsel would be compromised if witnesses\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 6 of lo\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l2, 2o2l\nPage 6\nadverse consequences.” TR ll/l/2o2l, p 6:2o-23. The harassment and intimidation gg\nwill experience if it becomes public that she testified at the request of Ms. Maxwell cannot be\noverstated. If her identity is revealed, My will be a prime target for media hysteria and\nharassment in all its forms.\n\nAt trial, this rationale for anonymity extended beyond the alleged victims themselves to\ninclude several witnesses and third parties. Exhibits with witness or third-party identifying\ninformation were filed under seal or redacted. (As noted above, there were at least forty-five\ntimes when an exhibit or series of exhibit was admited either partially or fully under seal to\nprotect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness.) Thus, even though yg is\nnot an alleged victim in this case, that does not mean she lacks profound professional and\npersonal privacy interests in not having her true name revealed in public. Likewise, ay\nshould be afforded the same privacy protection as have other witnesses whose true or full\nidentity has been safeguarded—courtroom artists should be precluded from drawing her true\nfacial likeness.\n\nFinally, Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to present a defense, to compulsory process,\nand to effective assistance counsel would be compromised without the protection of anonymity\nrequested here. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. As this Court said at the pretrial conference, “[g]liven\nthe sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further\nharassment or embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from\ncoming forward.” TR ll/l/2o2l, p 8:4-7. This logic applies with equal force to witnesses called\nby the defense. As to J in particular, there is no question she will face vitriol,\nharassment, and intimidation once she yy is publicly labeled asa\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 of lo\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government\ncan fully cross-examine ggg without publicly disclosing her name.\n\nPublication of J true identity is unnecessary and unreasonable, just as this\nCourt found it was with the alleged victims and Mat and Shawn. As the Court recognized in\nAlvarado v. Burge, “Testifying by giving an identifying number [or alias] rather than a [true]\nname does not necessarily curtail any trial rights. The cross-examiner can question the witness’\nactivities ... without regard to the witness’ name, and similarly has an opportunity to see and\nhear that which he testifies about.” No. 5 Civ. l85l(AKH), 2oo6 WL l84oo2o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 3o, 2oo6).\n\nThis Court should permit ggg to testify using a pseudonym.\n\nB. Michelle Healy\n\nMichelle Healy has a substantial personal privacy interest in testifying using her first\nname only. During her testimony, Jane alleged that “Michelle” participated in sexualized\nmassages and orgies with Mr. Epstein. From Jane’s description of “Michelle” in her testimony\nand her prior statements, it is clear that she is referring to Michelle Healy. Although Ms. Healy\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page9oflo\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l2, 2o2l\nPage 9\nand because nondisclosure of her true name will not deprive the government of the ability to\nmeaningfully cross-examine her, Ms. Healy’s interest in remaining anonymous outweighs any\ngovernment interest, “especially where the [government] knous the true identit[y] of [Ms.\nHealy].” Gov. Mot. in Limine, p 8 (citing cases).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhen this Court read its preliminary instructions to the jury, it said:\n\nAs I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to\n\nreceive significant atention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permited\n\nwitnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name\n\nor a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are knoun to the government, the\n\ndefendant, to the Court, and were shoun to you during jury selection. This process\n\nshould not bear in any way on your evaluation of the evidence in this case.\nTR ll/29/2o2l, pp 24-25.\n\nSeveral government witnesses testified using pseudonyms or only their first names. The\nlogic of allouing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of\ncounsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\nprecluded from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page7of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l3, 2o2l\nPage 7\n\nFinally, the government’s one-sentence 4o3 argument fails. Gov. Leter at 6 (“[T]he\nagreement runs the risk of ‘confusing the issue’ and ‘misleading the jury’ by presenting a\ndocument from which the jury is asked to infer conclusions that range far beyond the\nevidence.”). The jury will not be confused or misled by evidence that Kate could not have visited\nMs. Maxwell at Kinnerton Street in l994 because Ms. Maxwell did not purchase that home for\nanother two years. In contrast, jurors wi// be misled if they don’t learn that Kate testified to\nsomething that could not have happened.\n\nae ok Ok\n\n“The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on\nfull disclosure of all the facts.” United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7o9 (l974) (“We have\nelected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues\nbefore a court of law. The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both\nfundamental and comprehensive.”). To that end, Ms. Maxwell has a due process right to present\nevidence in her defense. U.S. Const. amend. V, VI. Excluding the l996 Agreement, when Ms.\nMaxwell did not violate Rule l6 and the government has suffered no prejudice, would infringe\nthis <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> guarantee. And it would pervert the search for the truth, mislead the jury, and\nundermine the integrity of the criminal justice system. In the words of the Supreme Court, “The\nends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or\nspeculative presentation of the facts.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7o9.\n\nThis Court should deny the government’s motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 722 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 of7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

When the group massages began to\ninvolve others beyond Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell joined in with Sophie and Eva. Sophie\nand Eva “knew the routine.”\n\ne In August 2o2l, Jane told the government that Eva was the “Ms Sweden Lady” (Mr.\nVisoski testified that Eva Dubin was a former Ms. Sweden). At the time, Jane did “not\nremember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva “aged out of that.” Jd. At\nthe same time, Jane “did not recall there being another Eva.”\n\ne Inher testimony in this case, Jane told the jury that Eva was involved in the group\nsexualized massages with Mr. Epstein, Sophie, and Ms. Maxwell, that she “knew the\nroutine,” and that she “could confirm her story.”\n\nThe record is clear that Jane has previously claimed (in February 2o2o) and testified (in\nthis case) that Eva Dubin was involved in the sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. Given that allegation, Ms. Maxwell has a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to call Eva Dubin to the\nstand and present her testimony, which will deny the allegations and contradict Jane’s claims.\n\nPerhaps hoping this Court won’t notice, the government buries most of the facts about\nJane’s allegations about Eva in a footnote. Gov. Leter, pp 5-6 n.l. But even that footnote\nmischaracterizes what Jane said about Eva. Jane did not tell the government that Eva Dubin was\nnot involved in group sexualized massages. At most, Jane said she “does not remember DUBIN\nbeing involved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o, p l. But that’s contrary to what she said in February\n2o2o, and it’s contrary to what she said on the stand. And it’s wholly inconsistent with Jane’s\nstatement that she “does not recall there being another Eva.” /d. at 2.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagel2oofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Even if that is what those cases hold (which Ms. Maxwell\ndisputes), the cases have no applicability here, because the details of the sexualized massages are\nnot collateral issues.

If the government\nwants to argue that Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are not the Eva, Michelle, and\nKelly who Jane was referring to, the government is free to make that argument.

Each of these individuals (the accusers) filed claims with the EVCP,\nand each received multi-million-dollar payouts. Accuser-l has told the government that she\nreceived $5,ooo,ooo; Accuser-2 has told the government that she received $l,5oo,ooo; Witness-3\nhas told the government that she received $3,25o,ooo; and Accuser-4 has told the government\nshe received $3,5oo,ooo.\n\nMs. Maxwell, houever, does not have the payment records and cannot verify whether\nthese figures are accurate. Nor does she have all the releases the accusers signed, and therefore\nno way to evaluate what consideration was offered and what the accusers gave up in exchange\nfor the payouts. Finally, Ms. Maxwell does not have the accusers’ submissions to the EVCP or\ncommunications between the accusers and the EVCP.

Unlike Ms. Maxwell’s earlier subpoena to Boies Schiller & Flexner\n(BSF), which the Court declined to issue, Dkt. Nos. 252, 298, the Court here authorized and\nissued Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to the EVCP, concluding (preliminarily and correctly) that it\nwas proper under Rule l7(c). See Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d at 56l (“As the Supreme Court has\nexplained, it is the responsibility of the court, not the opposing party, to ensure that a subpoena\nsecured under Rule l7(c) is for a proper purpose.” (citing United States v. Tomison, 969 F. Supp.\n587, 594 (E.D. Cal. l997))). Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks production aft trial (not pretrial), and\nit also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for inspection, this Court\nconduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrouness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has\nsuggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in\nconfidentiality.\n\nEveryone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested\nmaterial, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not\notherwise procurable.

The <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> backdrop.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v. Van\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 68o (l986) (quoting Davis v.

The importance of cross-examination cannot be\noverstated where, as here, the government’s proof depends almost entirely on the uncorroborated\ntestimony of the accusers. Poventud v.

See Nixon, 4l8 U.S.\nat 7ll.\n\nB. The materials requested are relevant.\n\nThe standard for relevance is “very lou,” United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246 (2d\nCir. 2ol2) (explaining that Rule 4ol prescribes a “very lou standard”), and the definition of\nrelevance is “very broad,” United States v. Certified Envil. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 9o (2d Cir.\n2ol4). “Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.”\nFed.

N.L.R.B., 7l8 F.2d 269, 277 (8th Cir. l983) (“Rule 4o8 excludes evidence of setlement\noffers only if such evidence is offered to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim under\nnegotiation.” (emphasis added)).\n\nHere, the “disputed claim” is government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell trafficked the\naccusers, facilitated their abuse, and conspired to do the same. “The claim” each accuser\ncompromised with the EVCP was “the claim” that they were entitled to money for the abuse\nperpetrated by Mr. Epstein. Because Ms. Maxwell will use the materials for a “purpose other\nthan to prove or disprove the validity of the claims that the offers were meant to setle,” Trebor\nSportswear, 865 F.2d at 5lo, Rule 4o8 does not apply.\n\nSecond, even if Rule 4o8 did apply, it would not bar admission of the evidence because\nevidence of compromise is admissible to prove a witness’s bias and prejudice, a traditional\nobject of cross-examination. Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(b). Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 68o (defendants have\na <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to engage in “cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of\nbias on the part of the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors...\ncould appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” (quoting Davis,\n4l5 U.S. at 3l8)). There is no dispute that the accusers’ setlement of their claims against Mr.\nEpstein for vast sums of money is relevant to their bias and motive in both cooperating with the\ngovernment to secure prosecutorial credit, a factor in the EVCF’s protocol, and testifying against\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 23 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell does not seek production of materials\nrelated to other claimants, and there is no reason to think that production of the materials related\nto Ms. Maxwell’s accusers—who have not acted to keep confidential their claims against Mr.\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell—will somehou impair the functioning of the EVCP in working with\nothers. Indeed, the EVCP is nou closed and there is no more work to be done—the cut-off for\nclaims has passed, the money has been paid, and the fund is closed.\n\nMoreover, the lack of an objection by either Accuser-l or Accuser-4 belies the argument\nthat compliance with Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive, at least as\nto them.

It seeks only that evidence\nwhich is relevant to her defense and admissible at trial. Although the concerns about\nconfidentiality are overbloun, Ms. Maxwell nevertheless has asked that this Court review the\nmaterial in camera before turning it over to the defense. That in camera review would provide\nanother layer of protection, even as there is no reason to think that Ms. Maxwell is on a fishing\nexpedition.\n\nAccordingly, and for the reasons given above, Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court deny\nthe motions to quash.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Page9ofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Nine\nArgument\n\nThe subpoena should be quashed because (i) compliance would be unreasonable or\noppressive; (i) it seeks documents that are inadmissible under Rule 4o8 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence; and (il) it seeks “statements” of a witness that are not subject to subpoena under Rule\nl7(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nA.

Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an impartial jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v.

Ms. Maxwell also provides compelling\nadditional information in this submission, not available at the time of the initial bail hearing\n(which was held l2 days after her arrest), that squarely addresses each of the Court’s\nconcerns from the initial hearing and fully supports her release on the proposed bail\nconditions. This information includes: (l) evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s significant family ties in\nthe United States; (2) a detailed financial report, which has also been reviewed by a former IRS\nCID special agent, concerning her financial condition and assets, and those of her spouse, for the\nlast five years: (3) irrevocable waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France and expert opinions stating that it would be highly unlikely that Ms.\nMaxwell would be able to resist extradition in the implausible event of her fleeing to either\ncountry; (4) evidence rebuting the Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell atempted to\nevade detection by law enforcement prior to her arrest; and (5) a discussion of the weakness of\nthe government’s case against Ms. Maxwell, including the lack of corroborative,\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence in support of the three accusers.\n\nMs. Maxwell vehemently maintains her innocence and is commited to defending herself.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which\nare based on the uncorroborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago. The Court should grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the restrictive\nconditions proposed belou to ensure her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to prepare her defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020058.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page aH426lo45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits. This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the\nMDC. Within a two-day period from December l to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,\ncompared with 25 from March to December l. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020117.jpg": "Caseeb2d-cre6o88GiAU Ant BecuunNdrt lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2th gPage Lace l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The\npresumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics\nof the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant’s new arguments change the\nCourt’s original determination.\n\nD.

Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020850.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Court has\nrecently explained the law on constructive amendment and variance. “To prevail on a constructive\namendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] indictment are in effect\naltered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of\nthe offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been\nconvicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5-\ncr-769 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7) (cleaned up). “Because the\ndoctrine of constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a\nconstructive amendment constitutes a “per se violation’ of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> nghts—\ni.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a specific shouing of prejudice.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l7 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nAlthough the Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility” in hou the\ngovernment proves the crime alleged, the defendant must be “given notice of the core of\ncriminality to be proven at trial.” /d. (cleaned up). “[A]lthough an indictment ‘drawn in general\nterms’ may articulate a broad core of criminality, an indictment that is drawn in specific terms\nmay be read to specify a narrouer set of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at\ntrial could lead to a constructive amendment.” /d.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020957.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel3l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l4 of 4o\n\nthe juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” /d. at l7l\n(quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47). The ensuing determination of whether the juror was biased or\nprejudiced against the defendant may be “affected both by whether the nondisclosure was\ndeliberate and, if it was, by the juror’s motivation to conceal the truth.” United States v. McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73. It is important to consider\nwhether a juror’s answer was dishonest in the second part of the test “because it can shou ‘a\npersonal interest in this particular case that was so pouerful as to cause the juror to commit a\nserious crime [by lying during voir dire].’” United States v. Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d 42o, 438\n(W.D.N.Y. 2ol7), aff'd sub nom. United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (alteration\nin original) (quoting United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify\n\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the\n\neffect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\n\nconcerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or\n\nevidence of a juror’s statement on these maters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). As explained in this Court’s prior opinion, the rule is subject to certain\nexceptions inapplicable here. See Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at l2. The rule, which embodies\n“long-accepted Federal law,” is an important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.\nTanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987) (rejecting a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> challenge to the\ntule). It enables “full and frank discussion in the jury room” and secures “jurors’ willingness to\nreturn an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the rule, the finality of verdicts, upon which the\nsystem relies, would be seriously disrupted. See id. at l2o-2l, l24-25; see also Warger v.\nShauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 45, 49-5o (2ol4).

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\n<span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021540.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 364 3536o39, Pagello of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l6 of 2l\n\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.

Even if the Court considered Juror 5o’s statement about another juror,\nthe evidence would be insufficient to meet the high threshold for an inquiry. Without\nnonspeculative evidence of misconduct by any juror but Juror 5o, the Court restricts the focus of\nthe evidentiary hearing to Juror 5o. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.°\nIV.

In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights.” /d.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463.

Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span> rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7°4 A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o3 See, e.g., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 US. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a <span class=\"highlight\">constitutional</span>\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.
