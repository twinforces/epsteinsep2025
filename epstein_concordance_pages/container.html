Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os. Medical records reflect that the\ndefendant weighed l46 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed l44.5 pounds when she\nwas last weighed in April 2o22. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to\nincarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nAs the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every\nl5 minutes, from approximately 9:3o pm to 6:3o am. It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic <span class=\"highlight\">container</span>, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an improvement, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020280.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNit Dieu itren2l9@2 lFited 547o6/249 Pdgef Raf 6\nPage 5\n\nlegal counsel informed the Government that the defendant’s meals arrive in containers that are\nboth microuavable and oven safe. Currently, the defendant’s meals are heated in a thermal oven.\nThe tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions\nwhen the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off.\nDuring those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with botled\nwater. After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or broun and needs to run\nfor several seconds before becoming clear. MDC staff have not observed any instance in which\nthe water in the defendant’s cell did not clear after being run for several seconds. MDC legal\ncounsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the\nsame water system as the defendant while in the institution.\n\nMDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per\nweek. During her time at the MDC, the defendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and\nthe l4os. The defendant’s louest observed weight was l33 pounds in July of 2o2l. Since then,\nher weight has fluctuated but has never been louer than l34 pounds. Most recently, when the\ndefendant was weighed last week, her weight was l37.5 pounds. The defendant is 5’ 7”, meaning\nthat even her louest weight of l33 pounds resulted in a BMI of 2o.8, which is considered a normal\nweight for a person of the defendant’s height. MDC staff have not observed the defendant\nexperience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-l9\nvaccine and is nou fully vaccinated. In short, MDC medical staff assess that the defendant is\nphysically healthy.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o28o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025124.jpg": "Page 762\nevidence and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing a\npsychological reconstruction.\"\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic concern.
