Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”\nExhibit 2, Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2ol3),\nDkt. 2o5-2, at 9. The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government atorneys\nin those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged\nfederal crimes commited against them.” /d. at lo. The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal transaction. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial international travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added). Senior officials at the Department\nof Justice reviewed the NPA and either authorized or helped negotiate the resolution of the\nmater.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 6 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page5of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Even on more routine maters, Ms. Maxwell’s treatment has\nbeen worse than other pretrial detainees. For example, Ms. Maxwell has no access to email and\nhas been given 3o minutes per month for personal phone calls, far fewer than the 5oo minutes\ngranted to other pretrial detainees since the COVID-l9 crisis. Unlike defendants in the general\npopulation, she does not have a desk or a writing surface where she can take notes when\nreviewing the discovery. And until recently, Ms. Maxwell was denied access to the prison\ncommissary for no apparent reason.\n\nWe respect that the BOP needs to ensure the orderly operation of the MDC. But Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are unique to her and seem punitive rather than anything\nnecessary to ensure that the MDC as a whole is running smoothly. Accordingly, we respectfully\nrequest that, going forward, Ms. Maxwell be monitored in the same manner as other pretrial\ndetainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the same privileges given to\nother detainees.*\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s motion.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n__/s/ Christian R.

We are aware of no other\npretrial detainee receiving such treatment.\n“In our original leter, the defense asked the Court to order the BOP to release Ms. Maxwell into the general\npopulation because we had been informed that Ms. Maxwell would not receive certain privileges, like access to a\ndesk and the prison commissary, unless she were housed there. As long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same\nmanner, and receives the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general\npopulation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 2 of 4\nalleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify\nsuch relief at this very early stage. Follouing the close of discovery, the parties should meet and\nconfer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to\nreach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The\ndenial is therefore without prejudice.\nI. The Defendant’s Conditions of Confinement\n\nIn her August lo, 2o2o leter motion, the Defendant also sought “an order directing\n[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with\nincreased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully\nparticipate in the preparation of her defense.” Dkt. No. 38 at l. The Government responded that\nthe BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement so that she has access to\ndiscovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 4l at 5. The Defendant’s\nreply credited the BOP’s change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to “confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP” and “that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the\nsame privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5.\n\nThe Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that\nallou her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the\npreparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary.\nShould facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient\naccess to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court.\n\nThe Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell “be monitored\nin the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooool744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page 3 of 4\nMaxwell the same privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt. No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the\ndefense clarifies that “[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives\nthe same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general\npopulation.” Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4.\n\nThe Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant’s request for an order directed to\nBOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that “[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff,” thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell’s ability to communicate with her counsel is in\nno way interfered. Dkt. No. 4l at 4n.5. And as to the more general implementation of\nsurveillance procedures, the Court credits BOP’s duty to ensure the safety and security of the\nDefendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 547\n(l979) (‘Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”). Nor does the Defendant provide\nany basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5.\nThough pretrial detainees “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law,” Wolfish, 44l U.S. at 535, it does not follou that surveillance measures\nare punitive just because the Defendant deems them “onerous.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The\nDefendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the\nsurveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes.\n\nAs aresult, Defendant’s request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to\ncontinue to adequately participate in her defense, houever, the Court hereby ORDERS the\nGovernment to provide writen status updates every 9o days detailing any material changes to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001818.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page l of 4\neS U.S. Department of Justice\nwe United States Atorney\n\n- Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request an extension of the deadline for\nthe production of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November\n9, 2o2o to November 23, 2o2o. This extension is necessary solely to allou adequate time for an\noutside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense\nconditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery\nand no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the\nextension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2o2o.\n\nTo date, the Government has produced more than 35o,ooo pages of discovery to the\ndefense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth\nproduction by the existing November 9, 2o2o deadline, as detailed belou. Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 69 Filed ll/o6/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nsearch of 62 of the electronic devices seized from Epstein. After the issuance of that new warrant,\nthe Government requested that the FBI re-produce the data from all 62 devices because the FBI’s\nprior production had only included a subset of the seized data and had not identified which file\ncame from which seized device. On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having identified approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has identified just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

I not only got to knou the senior\nMaxwells but also got to knou very well their children including Ghislaine, since my age of l5.\nThough I was spending more of my time with the older siblings ee | also\nchose deliberately to spend time with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, who were soon going to prep school\ntogether during term-time. You need to knou that their father was narcissistic, highly controlling and\ndemanding as a father, and let them knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity.\nSo all the kids knew they had to “make it on their oun” despite the wealth and <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> in which they\nwere grouing up.\nAs I got to knou each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one\nworked very hard at their jobs, as neither parent, Bob nor Bety. would easily bear any idleness, and\neach strove for their father's and mother's respect through that their intelligence and that hard work. So\nit didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at\nOxford, where she'd folloued her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation\nas a serious student. I also noticed that personally, Ghislaine was quick-wited, full of initiative and\ngood humor, sincerely caring touards everyone she knew.\nI've maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire Maxwell clan for most of my life. I didn't\ncontinue to visit them regularly in England, but I stayed in touch by phone, especially with Philip,\nIsabel, Bety and Christine from l962 through the present. I spent time with Bety, Mrs Maxwell, as\nshe needed support, having suddenly been left after the death of Robert Maxwell. Later on, I wrote a\nbook explaining my gratitude to Bety for all she'd taught me about goodness and maturity. When she\nwas finally on her deathbed with Parkinson's in 2ol3, I was glad Isabel, who was caring for her, read\nher my book.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-l Filed l2/l8/2o Page l of 2\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order.

The central protection\nin the Order was that none of Maxwell’s answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies\nSchiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law\nfirm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell’s option, to destroy it.\nMaxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if J did not.\n\n2.

She ruled that\nno deposition nor interrogatories could be sought from her for the foreseeable future, but that\nother discovery could proceed. /d. A short time later, on June l9, BSF reversed its position.\nRecognizing it could not provide further discovery to the government from Ms. Maxwell through\na deposition in the Farmer case, BSF then said it did wish to have the case stayed in its entirety\nwhile plaintiff participated in the Epstein payment program. /d., Dkt. 84.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the\nguarantee of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on\nMaxwell’s Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke\nin reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order.\n\nThis Court should (l) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A\nand any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2ol6 depositions\nand all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 22\ncase and use her oun words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to\nquash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 38\nprosecuted.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case.

Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press.

The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.

To the contrary, there are affirmative indications in the text that\nthe NPA applies only to the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under Annabi, the NPA is only binding\non the USAO-SDFL, and the defendant’s motion fails as a mater of law.\n\nZ. The Defendant Has Offered No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other\nDistricts\n\nAlthough a defendant may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosecutor and\ndefendant contained a promise to bind other districts, Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626, the defendant has\nfailed to do so here. The defendant’s motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory\nallegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.\n\nThe lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log filed by\nthe USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein’s victims. (Def. Mot. | at 22). The\nlog reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other\nstates—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since\nfederal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any\nway establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investigation, let alone\nthat the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the U.S. Atorney’s offices in those states would be\nbound by the NPA.\n\n* Interpreting the term “federal liability” in this provision could not be read to encompass all U.S.\nAtorney’s offices without also interpreting its neighboring term, “state . . . liability,” to refer to\nevery state prosecutor’s office in all fifty states. The USAO-SDFL clearly did not—and could\nnot—make such a broad promise.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo297o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002971.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 37 of 239\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log also does not establish that the USAO-SDFL involved other U.S.\nAtorney’s Offices in plea negotiations with Epstein. Grasping at straws, the defendant points to\na notation in the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log, which contains an entry for handwriten notes, reflecting that the\nprosecutor in the USAO-SDFL spoke with an Assistant U.S. Atorney in New York. (Def. Mot. l\nat 22). The notes referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log are atached hereto as Exhibit l. As the notes\nreflect, the prosecutor at the USAO-SDFL reached out to an Assistant U.S. Atorney at the USAO-\nSDNY to ask about a civil lawsuit relating to Epstein that was handled by the Civil Division of\nthis Office in the l99os. The Government is producing to defense counsel today emails that\nconfirm that this was the nature of the contact.*> One of those emails is atached hereto as Exhibit\n2 for the Court’s reference. Put simply, those communications provide no indication that the\nUSAO-SDNY was involved in plea negotiations with Epstein. Rather, the USAO-SDFL asked\nabout an old civil case involving Epstein that an AUSA at the USAO-SDNY happened to handle\nyears earlier. In sum, the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log in no way establishes that other districts were involved in\nnegotiating the NPA, much less that Epstein was promised that the NPA would bind other districts.\n\nThe defendant proffers no other documentary evidence beyond the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log. Instead,\nwithout any citation, she broadly alleges that “senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved\nin the negotiation and approval of the NPA.” (Def. Mot. l. at 22). This vague and unsworn\nallegation is not evidence. Moreover, any contacts between the USAO-SDFL and Main Justice\n> In response to the allegations raised by the defense’s motion, the Government identified the\nunderlying notes referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log. The Government is producing those underlying\nnotes, as well as the relevant emails, to defense counsel today. The Government has also been\ninformed by a human resources representative that payroll records reflect that the Assistant U.S.\nAtorney referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log left the USAO-SDNY on or about April 29, 2oo7, months\nbefore the NPA was executed. Although the Government has been informed that Human\nResources records do not contain information regarding a division transfer, the Government\nunderstands from colleagues that the Assistant U.S. Atorney worked in the Civil Division in the\nl99os and worked in the Criminal Division in the 2ooos.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo297l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003020.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 86 of 239\nmanufactured any alleged delay to gain a tactical advantage over her. She has “offered no credible\nevidence to suggest that the Government tarried in bringing charges against [her] solely to gain\nsome prosecutorial advantage.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5. As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful discovery” and notes that “after the disclosure of meaningful discovery, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July l3, 2olo) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the\nresult of pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported\nlater motion practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y. July l5, 2ol9) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay\nwithout prejudice to renewal).\n\n59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v.

Discussion\n\nThe Government did not, in any way, atempt to circumvent Martindell. To the contrary,\nthe Government presented Martindell squarely to the relevant courts, first arguing that its test was\nnot applicable, and then, in the alternative, that the requested relief should be granted even if the\ncourts applied the Martindell standard. It cannot possibly be the case that the Government was\natempting to “circumvent” a case that it cited ll times in its argument to both relevant courts.\n(See (Exs. 8 & 9). Instead, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller in connection with\nits investigation and made an application to two judges to modify Rule 26(c) protective orders that\nprecluded full compliance with those subpoenas. While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. After concluding\nthat reliance on the protective order was unreasonable,*° Chief Judge McMahon found that the\n“Government [ ] persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,” citing “significant\n6 See, e.g., Int’!

The Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained Pursuant to\nthe Subpoena Under the Fifth Amendment Is Without Merit\n\nThe defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to the subpoena on Fifth\nAmendment grounds fails for multiple, independent reasons. As an initial mater, Boies Schiller\nis not the Government and was not acting as an agent of the Government when it deposed the\ndefendant or otherwise litigated the civil case against her. That the defendant may regret her choice\nto respond to Boies Schiller’s questions during two depositions instead of invoking her <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nagainst self-incrimination does not transform that choice into a Fifth Amendment violation.\n\na. Applicable Law\ni. The Fifth Amendment — Generally\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part: “No person . . . shall be compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. To establish a Fifth\nAmendment violation, an individual must “demonstrate the existence of three elements:\nl) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication, and 3) the incriminating nature of that\ncommunication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d ll66, ll68 (l987); see also, e.g., In Re\nThree Grand Jury Subpoenas Jan. 5, l988, 847 F.2d lo24, lo28 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nIt is “axiomatic that the Amendment does not automatically preclude self-incrimination,\nwhether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials.” United States v.\nWashington, 43l U.S. l8l, l86 (l977). “Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution,\nadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable.” Jd. at l87. “[T]he\nFifth Amendment proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a ‘genuine compulsion of\ntestimony.’” /d. (quoting Michigan v. Tucker, 4l7 U.S. 433, 44o (l974)); see also Washington,\n43l U.S. at l87 (“Absent some officially coerced self-accusation, the Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nis not violated by even the most damning admissions.”). Nor does the Constitution “prohibit every\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 239\nelement which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.” /d. The question\nis not whether a witness was encouraged to speak, but whether his “free will,” when he spoke,\n“was overborne.” /d. at l88; see also, e.g., United States v. Corbet, 75o F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir.\n2ol4).\n\nIt follous that the Government need not inform a witness of the nature of its investigation,\nsee United States v. Okwumabua, 828 F.2d 95o, 953 (2d Cir. l987), much less his individual status\nin the investigation, see Washington, 43l U.S. at l89 & l9o n.6. The Constitution does not\n“require that the police supply a suspect with a flou of information to help him calibrate his self-\ninterest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.” Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564,\n576-77 (l987) (internal quotation marks omited); see also, e.g., id. at 577 (there is no requirement\nthat law enforcement give information that might affect “the wisdom” of speaking). Nor does the\nConstitution require that someone be questioned only in the manner most likely to ensure that he\ngives the decision whether to speak careful thought. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 66o F.3d\nl49, l57 (2d Cir. 2oll) (‘the Fifth Amendment does not protect against hard choices” (internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Mullens, 536 F.2d 997, looo (2d Cir. l976) (there is a\ndifference between “those choices which are physically or psychologically coerced and those\nwhich are merely difficult’).\n\nIn short, the Fifth Amendment is only violated by “government misconduct” that is\n“coercive.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. l57, l63 (l986); see also Oregon v. Elstad, 47o U.S.\n298, 3l2 (l985) (Fifth Amendment prohibits “coercion” effected “by physical violence or other\ndeliberate means calculated to break the suspect’s will’).\n\nil. The Fifth Amendment — Act of Production <span class=\"highlight\">Privilege</span>\n\nThe act of production <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> is a form of the Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> pertaining to\n\nthe production of materials. “[A]n individual may claim an act of production <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> to decline\n97\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 239\nto produce documents, the contents of which are not privileged, where the act of production is,\nitself, (l) compelled, (2) testimonial, and (3) incriminating.” Jn re Three Grand Jury Subpoenas\nDuces Tecum Dated Jan. 29, l999, l9l F.3d l73, l78 (2d Cir. l999).\n\nConsistent with these requirements, the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> only “prohibits the compelled disclosure\nof documents when the act of production has independent communicative aspects—such as an\nadmission that the documents exist, that the subject possesses or controls the documents, that the\ndocuments are authentic, or that the subject believes the documents are responsive to the\nsubpoena.” Jn re Various Grand Jury Subpoenas, 924 F. Supp. 2d 549, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3),\naff'd, 579 F. App’x 37 (2d Cir. 2ol4); see also Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 39l, 4o8 (l976).\nIt follous that the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> does not apply when “[t]he existence and location of the [sought]\npapers are a foregone conclusion and the [compelled individual] adds litle or nothing to the sum\ntotal of the Government’s information by conceding that he in fact has the papers.” Jd. at 4ll; see\nalso In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir. l993);\nMadanes v. Madanes, l86 F.R.D. 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (“[E]ven if documents contain\nincriminating information, requiring a person to produce them does not implicate the Fifth\nAmendment unless the act of production is itself testimonial in nature and incriminating to the\nperson making the disclosure.”).\n\nil. The Fifth Amendment — When Private Action Is Deemed\nGovernment Action\n\nAs discussed above, “[t]he sole concern of the Fifth Amendment . . . is governmental\ncoercion.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l7o. “[T]he Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> is not concerned ‘with\nmoral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official\ncoercion.’” Jd. (quoting E/stad, 47o U.S. at 3o5). For this reason, even “[t]he most outrageous\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003061.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l27 of 239\nlawsuit against the defendant or took her deposition years before the Government initiated its oun\ninvestigation. The defendant offers no evidence to the contrary, and there is no reason to believe,\non this record, that the Government in any way controlled Boies Schiller when it litigated a civil\ncase against the defendant. As such, the Fifth Amendment does not apply.\n\nThe defendant’s claim further fails because without coercion or compulsion, there is no\nFifth Amendment violation. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 42o, 43l (l984) (rejecting claim\nthat a “failure to inform [the defendant] of the Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> barred use of his\nconfession at trial”); United States v. Mitchell, 966 F.2d 92, loo (2d Cir. l992) (“Inculpatory\nstatements are not involuntary when they result from a desire to cooperate, or from a defendant’s\nignorance of, or inatention to, his right to remain silent.”); United States v. Mast, 735 F.2d 745,\n75o (2d Cir. l984) (same). The defendant implicitly argues that she only testified under oath in\nthe civil mater because she thought she would not be held to that oath. In other words, had she\nknoun that she would be subject to the penalties of perjury, she would have invoked her Fifth\nAmendment right. But the defendant’s misguided expectation that she would face no\nconsequences cannot be said to coerce speech. The defendant, represented by able counsel,\nvoluntarily chose to waive her Fifth Amendment rights and testify under oath. And she chose to\ndo so in connection with civil depositions that occurred over two years before the Government\nopened its investigation. The circumstances surrounding that decision come nouhere near the type\nof coercion that rises to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation. See, e.g., United States v. Ash,\n464 F. Supp. 3d 62l, 627-3o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (finding suppression of defendant’s phone\nunwarranted where defendant complied with former employer’s request to return the phone\nbecause defendant was not coerced into doing so, and rejecting defendant’s argument that the\n\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 239\nemployer was required to warn her that it might produce the phone to the government, even\nassuming arguendo that that employer’s actions were atributable to the government).\n\nThe defendant’s claim that her act of production <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> was somehou violated similarly\nfails. Counsel cites Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6 (l886) for the proposition that “a\ncompulsory production of the private books and papers . . . [also] is compelling . . . him to be a\nwitness against himself, within the meaning of the fifth amendment.” (Det. Mot. ll at l5) (quoting\nBoyd, ll6 U.S. at 634-35). In Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, the\nSecond Circuit ruled that the Fifth Amendment does not protect the contents of private papers that\nare not business documents, and also noted that “[s]Jeveral aspects of the Boyd decision did not\nendure.” l F.3d at 9o (citing Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 39l (l976)).\n\nFurther, the Fifth Amendment does not protect against being compelled to speak and then\nspeaking falsely. “[E]ven if an individual’s perjured testimony is improperly procured because of\ngovernment misconduct, that testimony may still be used to prosecute that defendant for perjury.”\nUnited States v. Olivieri, 74o F. Supp. 2d 423, 425 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (citing United States v.\nRemington, 2o8 F.2d 567 (2d Cir. l953); United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 2o4 (2d Cir. l965));\nsee also United States v. Wong, 43l U.S. l74, l8o (l977) (“[P]erjury is not a permissible way of\nobjecting to the Government’s questions. . . . Indeed, even if the Government could, on pain of\ncriminal sanctions, compel an answer to its incriminating questions, a citizen is not at liberty to\nanswer falsely.”); Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 9o (l969) (rejecting challenge to false\nstatement prosecution; “[I]t cannot be thought that as a general principle of our law a citizen has a\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not have asked. ...

Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel72 of 239\nin each indictment—to his personal profit); United States v.

Aug. l9, l993) (similar).\n\nThe defendant also contends that her false statements were not connected to the substantive\noffenses because they were made in a civil deposition, rather than “to the grand jury or the FBI to\nderail its investigation.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial mater, and as evidenced by the\ndefendant’s oun motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,\nthe defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal\ninvestigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the\ndistinction is of litle moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly\nrejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. ll at 2 (arguing\nthat the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination\nat the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment\nthat distinction may have in other contexts, it has litle bearing on the severance analysis which\nturns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and\nis thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the\noffense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 5o5; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l (citing United States v. Carson,\n464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. l972); Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9) (affirming denial of a severance\nmotion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the\nperjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to\nthat analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the seting in which the statement\nis made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment.

USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination.

Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).

Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA.

United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). “A\nquestion is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of\nordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a\nquestioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as\ntestimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up).

In support of this motion, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nThroughout the pendency of this case Plaintiff repeatedly has represented to the Court\nand Ms. Maxwell that she is privy to, and part of, some ongoing criminal investigation in which,\nper Plaintiff's innuendo, Ms. Maxwell is a person of interest. For example, Plaintiff purports to\nbe withholding documents “relating to on-going [sic] criminal investigations by law enforcement\nrelating to [Ms. Maxwell’s] conduct.” See Plaintiff's Response in Opposition to Defendant’s\nMotion to Compel (Doc. #78) at 3.

According to Plaintiff, she “can\nimmediately provide clear evidence to this Court of hou [the purportedly ongoing] investigation\nwould be impaired...” /d. at ll. Further, Plaintiff refers to “the law enforcement inquiry that is\ncurrently underway,” id., representing to the Court that, in fact, there is an active investigation\nregarding Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not aware of any such investigation. Indeed, a review of the nou more\nthan a decade old police reports involving Mr. Epstein reflects that Ms. Maxwell was not a\nsuspect in any of the activity which resulted in any prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Counsel for Ms.\nMaxwell have atempted to learn about any investigation by contacting Assistant United States\nAtorney A. Marie Villafana, the Government lawyer handling the VRA litigation that Plaintiff\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003798.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- QF AAR VAD UME ALLSD , FRNA BEI29 |p ApecEks of 8\nApp.-ol34\nhas atempted to join. Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of any such\ninvestigation.\n\nPlaintiff also seems to be claiming that she is part of this alleged investigation and, as a\nconsequence, has inappropriately atempted to claim a non-existent “investigative <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>”\nwhich has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public interest <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>.” Issues related\nto Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery, including her specious claims of <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nhave been raised and fully briefed. Ms. Maxwell incorporates her Motion to Compel Responses\nto Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests (Doc. # 75) and Reply in support thereof (Doc. #\n92), by reference.\n\nAccording to Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell “cannot shou any significant reason for needing”\nthe information. This is, again, a meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is\nboth obvious and necessary for at least three reasons: first, any communications between\nPlaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement are likely inconsistent with statements Plaintiff has\nmade to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff's motive and bias in bringing this\nlitigation; and third, knouing the information will allou Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on\nany 5\" Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the\ninformation or accept a stay in the proceedings as a consequence of her failure to comply with\nher discovery obligations. She should not be alloued to brandish this, likely nonexistent, sword\nbut deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other\ndiscovery maters. Accordingly, in the event that the Plaintiff continues to fail to reveal the\ninformation that she claims to have regarding some “ongoing criminal investigation,” Ms.\nMaxwell moves to stay these proceedings.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003800.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- Qi BF AAR NVaD GUM ALASD , HHRedeie/ BEI29 | PA AadERE of 8\nApp.-ol36\n\nIn deciding to stay the civil case, courts generally weigh six factors: (l) the extent to\nwhich the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the\ncriminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the\ndelay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; (5) the interest of the Court; and\n(6) the public interest. See Trustees of the Plumbers and Pipefiters Nat’l Pension Fund v.\nTransworld Mech., Inc., 886 F. Supp. ll34, ll39 (S.D.N.Y. l995) (stay was appropriate so as to\nnot interfere with defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights).\n\nHere, consideration of the six factors weighs in favor of staying this action against Ms.\nMaxwell, largely because Plaintiff controls access to the alleged information and has refused to\nprovide the information to Ms. Maxwell. First, presumably the issues in any purported criminal\ninvestigation are identical with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in\n“trafficking” the Plaintiff as she claims from l999 to 2ool. As to the second factor Plaintiff\nclaims to have information about this issue, although no indictment has been issued. Third,\ngiven the age of the underlying allegations, almost 2o years, there does not appear to be any\nprejudice that could be caused by any delay. Fourth, in the event there actually is an\ninvestigation and Plaintiff is involved in fomenting the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a\nsignificant interest in knouing about the investigation so that she can appropriately respond and\nassess any claim of <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Concerning factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the\nproceedings before it and also has an interest in protecting the rights of the litigants. Appropriate\ndisclosure would allou an informed decision to be made regarding these issues.

Thus, there is no\n“cognizable interest” in “controlling the timing of disclosures,” id., because under the\ngovernment’s “willful blindness” policy there would be nothing to disclose.\n\nThe final “interest” advanced by the government is in “its oun communications.” For\nsupport, the government cites United States v.

The Government Has No “Need” to Knou.\n\nThe government claims, without support, that “[t]he only way for the [g]overnment to\nvindicate” its ill-defined interests “is with notice” so that it can move to quash the subpoenas.\nThe government ignores the role of this Court in this process. All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule. The Court is keenly\naware of the standards necessary for the issuance of a Rule l7 subpoena and needs no\nassistance from the government in performing this gatekeeping function. Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel understand the scope and limitations of Rule l7 and have not requested anything that\nwould run afoul of the Rule. The subpoena recipients are third parties who are well qualified\nto assert any objection to the subpoena requests.\n\nA similar request was made, and rejected in Ray, supra, at *7:\n\nthe Government is not entitled to be informed of the complete universe of\n\nsubpoenas requested by the defense that may relate to other victims, nou or\n\ngoing forward. In its leters and at argument, the Government urged that it had\n\nan independent obligation to protect the rights of victims and that it was best\n\nsituated to inform the Court of the relevance or lack of relevance of any\n\nsubpoena related to victim records. That obligation to protect the rights of\n\nvictims, houever, also is shared by the Court, and the Court is fully capable of\n\ndirecting the Government be informed of a subpoena and requesting the\n\nappropriate information in an appropriate case and regardless whether the\n\nvictim objects.\n\nIV. The Government is Not Entitled to Advance Notice of Material Produced\n\nThe government offers no authority for its request that it receive contemporaneous\ncopies of any material produced pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena. This request is remarkable\ngiven that the government has steadfastly refused to identify the names of the alleged\naccusers, the details about the alleged offense, or the statements made by the accusers.

While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties’ intent would be in the possession of\nthe government and Epstein’s counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few\nclues available to the public—such as a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log filed in a related civil lawsuit—for crumbs\nof information about the negotiation and investigation.\n\nThe government’s response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic\nevidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—\nshould be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three\npages from the above-referenced <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims,\nall of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL’s consultation with the United States\nAtorney’s Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL atorneys to New York, or interviews\nand/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses.

In response, the government has focused on only one of\nthose three entries and produced the documents referenced in the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log. See Opp. lo.\n\n7 The government’s argument that a United States Atorney lacks the “authority” to bind other districts (Opp. l3-\nl4)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Atorney has\nnot received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government\ncites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not\nonly by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other\ndistricts—but also by the Second Circuit’s statement that a United States Atorney may bind other districts in a plea\nagreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect.

Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper\n\nThe government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the\nPerjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act\nCounts. Resp. l4l-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in\none instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.\nResp. at l44. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the\ngovernment uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to\nprove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not sufficient reason, by itself, to\ntry the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the\ninterests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some\noverlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).\n\nIncredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions\ninstead of asserting the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination is somehou admissible in the trial of\nthe Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at l4l-42. For example, the government\nrepeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The\nactual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you knou .. .” and her answer was “I don’t\nknou what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not\nby demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did knou what the examiner was talking about, but instead\nthat a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And\nthe answer of not understanding the questioner shous “consciousness of guilt.” This is a circular\nargument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch.

Any reasonable, intelligent, jury cannot be instructed to ignore the follouing:\n\ne = Ms. Maxwell was sued for defamation by an alleged victim because she called the\nalleged victim a liar.\n\ne The government necessarily believes that Ms. Maxwell, not the alleged victims in\nthis case, is a liar, which is why the government charged her with perjury.\n\ne By implication, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers here, arguing that she is innocent, should not\nbe believed because they were complicit in the perjury.\n\ne In considering whether the jury should convict Ms. Maxwell of enticing girls to\ntravel to perform illegal sex acts the jury should ignore all of the underlying facts\nrelated to the defamation action including, for example, the 3o alleged victims,\nEpstein’s setlement, the CVRA litigation, Epstein’s, and Ms. Maxwell’s non-\nprosecution agreement.\n\nIn addition, the government glosses over, via a footnote, enormous prejudice atendant to\nthe perjury charges: Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice for five years also represented her in the\ndefamation action. The deposition transcript and the perjury charges place the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell’s lawyers at issue. The government obfuscates hou it intends to establish materiality of\nthe statements, but it is probable that the government will atempt to do so through the testimony\nof the civil lawyers who prosecuted the defamation action. Any rational jury would want, as a\ncounter, testimony from the defending lawyers on the same topic. The government suggests that\nthis is no problem, at least for the prosecutors, under NY RPC 3.7.

BSF tries to cobble an “any or all” argument together by picking the\nword “any” from the definition section of the subpoena identifying the two entities, BSF and the\nUSAO-SDNY, and ataching it to the word “all” from a separate paragraph defining\n“communication.” Of course, absent these definitions, BSF would be complaining that the\nsubpoena was vague because it failed to define either the entities involved or what was meant by\n“communication.”\n\nSignificantly, BSF already identified some of the communications between itself and the\ngovernment. According to its so called “Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre’s Revised Supplemental\n<span class=\"highlight\">Privilege</span> Log Dated April 29, 2ol6,” BSF refused to produce as privileged “approx. 57”\ndocuments that it identified as “correspondence re the currently ongoing criminal investigation of\nthe Defendant [Ms. Maxwell] and others.”!

First, BSF admits that these communications occurred. Second, the\ncommunications about trying to get Ms. Maxwell indicted were “prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial,” admiting both relevance and admissibility. BSF does not and cannot\nplausibly explain hou a joint effort to procure a civil opponent’s indictment is protected by the\nwork product doctrine.

The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance and Admissibility.\n\nThe Court’s analysis does not stop at specificity—Requests l through 5 independently fail\nbecause the Defendant has not demonstrated that all of the communications she seeks are relevant\nand admissible. The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\nsubstance and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp.

The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun.

Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses.

Moreover, by the time\nAUSA [RE told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would\nshou “page after page of people taking the Fifth,” it was already a mater of public record that\nMaxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.?> The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9o of 349\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information. United States’ Response to Petitioners’ Motion to Use Correspondence to Prove Violations of\nthe [CVRA] and to Have Their Unredacted Pleadings Unsealed (Apr. 7, 2oll). The court declined to order the\nadditional redactions.\nl63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 _ Filed o6/o4/2l Page3of6\nrepresented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after\nmeeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she\ntook with Epstein. Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to\ndoubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the\ndiary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references\nalone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which\nMinor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to\npotential impeachment.\n\nNor do any of Maxwell’s additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the\njournal.

Furthermore, to the extent she makes an\nargument under Rule lo6 or Rule 6l2, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule lo6\nand Rule 6l2 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only\nripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admited. Her Rule 6l2 argument is\nfurther strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to\nproduction of the entire journal. The Rule provides that “[i]f the producing party claims that the\nwriting includes unrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.” Fed.

The Government did not violate Maxwell’s right against self-incrimination\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “The [Supreme] Court has held\nrepeatedly that the Fifth Amendment is limited to prohibiting the use of ‘physical or moral\ncompulsion’ exerted on the person asserting the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>.” Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S.\n39l, 397 (l976) (quoting Perlman v. United States, 247 U.S. 7, l5 (l9l8)). It does not prohibit\nthe Government from using a defendant’s voluntary statements in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.\n\nTo establish a violation of the right against compelled self-incrimination, Maxwell must\n“demonstrate the existence of three elements: l) compulsion, 2) a testimonial communication,\nand 3) the incriminating nature of that communication.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d\nll66, ll68 (2d Cir. l987). Maxwell contends that the Government violated her right against\ncompelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies of her deposition transcripts from her earlier\ncivil case. She acknouledges that she could have, but did not, invoke her Fifth Amendment\nrights to avoid providing incriminating testimony. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S.\n248, 263-24 & n.24 (l983). Houever, she contends that she testified only because she believed\nthe protective order in that case would prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and\nusing it in a subsequent criminal case against her.\n\nSecond Circuit precedent expressly forecloses Maxwell’s argument. “A Rule 26(c)\nprotective order, no mater hou broad its reach, provides no guarantee that compelled testimony\nwill not somehou find its way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution.” Andover Data Servs. v. Stat. Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d lo8o, lo83 (2d Cir.\nl989).

During\nthose depositions, Cosby made several incriminating statements.\n\nD.A.

We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A.

Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the Commonwealth. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby\n\nwould not be prosecuted no mater what.

Castor did not communicate to Constand or her counsel his decision to\npermanently forego prosecuting Cosby. In fact, Constand did not learn of the decision\nuntil a reporter appeared at one of her civil atorney’s offices later that evening. With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring discovery in that lawsuit, Cosby sat for four depositions. Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that Cosby could be\nprosecuted in the future. D.A. Castor’s decision was not included in any writen\nstipulations, nor was it reduced to writing.\n\n6 See Constand v. Cosby, Docket No. 2:o5-cv-olo99-ER.\nt Constand’s atorneys subsequently filed a motion to compel Cosby to answer.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 8o\nbelieve any state judge would allou that deposition into evidence, nor\nanything derived therefrom. In fact, that was the specific intent of all parties\ninvolved including the Commonwealth and the plaintiff's lawyers. Knouing\nthis, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without\nanything the deposition led you to, | think Cosby would have an action\nagainst the County and maybe even against you personally. That is why |\nhave publically suggested looking for lies in the deposition as an alternative\nnou that we have learned of all these other victims we did not knou about\nat the time we had made the go, no-go decision on arresting Cosby. |\npublically suggested that the DA in California might try a common plan\nscheme or design case using [Constand’s] case as part of the res gestae in\ntheir case. Because | knew Montgomery County could not prosecute Cosby\nfor a sexual offense, if the deposition was needed to do so. But | thought\nthe DA in California might have a shot because | would not have the pouer\nto bind another state’s prosecutor.\n\nSome of this, of course, is my opinion and using Cosby’s deposition in the\n\nCA case, might be a stretch, but one thing is fact: the Commonwealth,\n\ndefense, and civil plaintiffs lawyers were all in the agreement that the\n\natached decision from me stripped Cosby of this Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nagainst self-incrimination, forcing him to be deposed. That led to Cosby\npaying [Constand] a lot of money, a large percentage of which went to her\nlawyers on a contingent fee basis. In my opinion, those facts will render\n\nCosby’s deposition inadmissible in any prosecution in Montgomery County\n\nfor the incident that occurred in January 2oo4 in Cheltenham Tounship.\n\nBruce\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5.\n\nReplying by leter, D.A. Ferman asserted that, despite the public press release,\nthis was the first she had learned about a binding understanding between the\nCommonwealth and Cosby. She requested a copy of any writen agreement not to\nprosecute Cosby. D.A. Castor replied with the follouing email:\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that we would not\n\nprosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers for [Constand] wanted and |\n\nagreed. The reason | agreed and the plaintiffs lawyers wanted it in writing\n\nis so that Cosby could not take the 5th Amendment to avoid being deposed\n\nor testifying. A sound strategy to employ. That meant to all involved,\n\nincluding Cosby’s lawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in\n\nthe civil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution for\n\nthe event we had him under investigation for in early 2oo5. | signed the\n\npress release for precisely this reason, at the request of [Constand’s]\n\ncounsel, and with the acquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the Commonwealth so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 8o\nless than flatering light,” as a threat to Ms. Constand and her atorneys\nshould they atack his office. In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\nreference to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [Cosby]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [Cosby] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [Cosby]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. Cosby of his Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. He testified that he did\nnot learn the investigation had been reopened until he read in the paper that\n[Cosby] was arrested in December 2ol5, but there was media speculation\nin September 2ol5 that an arrest might be imminent.\nOn September 23, 2ol5, apparently in response to this media speculation,\nunprompted and unsolicited, Mr. Castor sent an email to then District\nAtorney Risa Vetri Ferman. His email indicated, in pertinent part,\n\nI’m writing you just in case you might have forgoten what we\n\ndid with Cosby back in 2oo5. .. Once we decided that the\n\nchances of prevailing in a criminal case were too remote to\n\nmake an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve\n\njustice was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would\n\nhave the best chance of prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby.\n\nWith the agreement of [Atorney Phillips] and [Constand’s]\n\nlawyer, | wrote the atached [press release] as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending.\n\nAgain, with the agreement of the defense lawyer and\n\n[Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally and specifically bound the\n\nCommonwealth that there would be no state prosecution of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ... But those lawyers\nrepresenting [Constand] civilly . .. were part of this agreement\nbecause they wanted to make Cosby testify. | believed at the\ntime that they thought making him testify would solidify their\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the\nCommonwealth) to promise not to prosecute him. So in effect,\nthat is what | did. | never made an important decision without\ndiscussing it with you during your tenure as First Assistant.\n\n[B]ut one thing is fact. The Commonwealth, defense and civil\n\nplaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the atached\n\ndecision from me stripped Cosby of his Fifth Amendment\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.\nHe indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date\nof his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not\n\ntake the 5\" Amendment to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated. By signing my name as District Atorney and\n\nissuing the atached, | was “signing off” on the Commonwealth\n\nnot being able to use anything Cosby said in the civil case\n\nagainst him in a criminal prosecution, because | was stating\n\nthe Commonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for the\n\nincident based on the then-available evidence in order to help\n\nthe Plaintiff prevail in her civil action . . . [nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the Commonwealth or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity. At no time during the civil suit did Ms. Troiani\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 27 of 8o\n\nOn March 8, 2oo5, Ms. Constand filed her civil suit and Mr. Schmit retained\n\nPatrick O’Conner, Esq., as civil counsel. Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [Cosby] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[Cosby] did not invoke the Fifth Amendment in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [Cosby’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [Cosby]. [Cosby] did not\n\nassert a Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\nCosby. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to prosecute Cosby, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the Commonwealth not to\nprosecute Cosby was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time. It was only\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25. He\ncontinued, “[s]o if they had evidence that some of these other women had been sexually\nassaulted at Cosby’s home in Cheltenham, then | thought they could go ahead with the\nprosecution of that other case with some other victim, so long as they realized they could\nnot use the Constand deposition and anything derived therefrom.” /d.\n\nAs noted, the trial court denied the motion, finding that then-D.A. Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby that the Commonwealth\nwould not prosecute him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 29 of 8o\npermission from a court is a prerequisite to any offer of transactional immunity. See id.\n§ 5947(b) (“The Atorney General or a district atorney may request an immunity order\nfrom any judge of a designated court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such\npermission, and instead acted of his oun volition, the trial court concluded that any\npurported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the\ntrial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of\nan enforceable promise not to prosecute.” T.C.O. at 62.\n\nThe trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and hou\nhe did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63. The court deemed the former district atorney's\ncharacterization of his decision-making and intent to be inconsistent, inasmuch as he\ntestified at times that he intended transactional immunity, while asserting at other times\nthat he intended use and derivative-use immunity. The trial court specifically credited\nAtorney Troiani’s statements that she never requested that Cosby be provided with\nimmunity and that she did not specifically agree to any such offer.\n\n(c) Order to testify.--WWhenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in\n\na proceeding specified in subsection (a), and the person presiding at such\n\nproceeding communicates to the witness an immunity order, that witness\n\nmay not refuse to testify based on his <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination.\n\n(d) Limitation on use.--No testimony or other information compelled under\n\nan immunity order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such\n\ntestimony or other information, may be used against a witness in any\n\ncriminal case, except that such information may be used:\n(l) in a prosecution under l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o2 (relating to perjury) or\nunder l8 Pa.C.S. § 49o3 (relating to false swearing);\n(2) in a contempt proceeding for failure to comply with an immunity\norder; or\n(3) as evidence, where otherwise admissible, in any proceeding\nwhere the witness is not a criminal defendant.\n42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(a)-(d).\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation. Thus, the\nCommonwealth argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for\nthe trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. . Schmit’s testimony, as it is patently\nobvious that his testimony belies his claim that there was some ‘promise’ from [Mr.] Castor\nnot to prosecute.” /d. (quoting Commonwealth’s Superior Court Brief at l36-37). The\nSuperior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [Cosby's] alleged\nreliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nin the civil suit.” /d. at 4l3-l4.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s claim that the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he\npurportedly should have enjoyed. The court opined that Cosby’s suppression argument\nwas “contingent upon his claim that Mr. Castor unilaterally immunized [Cosby] from\ncriminal prosecution, which we have already rejected.” /d. at 4l4. The panel\ndistinguished all of the precedents upon which Cosby relied, including this Court’s\ndecision in Commonwealth v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A.

In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard.

From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the interaction between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony. There is no\nevidence, nor any real contention, that the parties even contemplated a grant of immunity\nunder Section 5947. The trial court’s finding that the interaction between D.A.

Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend.

No court could have forced Cosby to testify in a deposition or at a trial so\nlong as the potential for criminal charges remained. Here, houever, when called for\ndeposition, Cosby no longer faced criminal charges. When compelled to testify, Cosby\nno longer had a right to invoke his right to remain silent.\n\nCosby was forced to sit for four depositions. That he did not—and could not—\nchoose to remain silent is apparent from the record. When Cosby atempted to decline\nto answer certain questions about Constand, Constand’s atorneys obtained a ruling from\nthe civil trial judge forcing Cosby to answer. Most significantly, Cosby, having maintained\nhis innocence in all maters and having been advised by a number of atorneys, provided\ncritical evidence of his recurring history of supplying women with central nervous system\ndepressants before engaging in (allegedly unwanted) sexual activity with them—the very\nassertion that undergirded Constand’s criminal complaint.\n\nThe trial court questioned whether Cosby believed that he no longer had a Fifth\nAmendment right to invoke during the civil proceedings, or whether he would have\ninvoked that right had he still possessed it. The court noted that Cosby voluntarily had\nsubmited to a police interview and had provided the police with a consent-based defense.\nCosby repeated this narrative in his depositions. The court found no reason to believe\nthat Cosby would not continue to cooperate as he had, and, thus, discerned no reason\nfor him to invoke the Fifth Amendment. In other words, it was not that the trial court\nsurmised that Cosby had no <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against compulsory self-incrimination to invoke, but\nrather that Cosby simply chose not to invoke it.\n\nThe trial court’s conjecture was legally erroneous. The trial court surmised that,\nalthough Cosby repeatedly told an exculpatory, consent-based version of the January\n2oo4 incident, he naturally would have been willing to offer inculpatory information about\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4879\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 74 of 8o\nfairness required enforcement of the prosecution’s plea offer that was later withdrawn,\nwhere the defendant detrimentally relied upon the offer); Commonwealth v.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar setlement. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 27\n.

Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3ofl4\n\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 3\nprofessional publications.

Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher. Furthermore, she pointed out that because these acts\ndo not yet constitute recognizable sexual abuse and because they share sim-\nilarities with legitimate activities, any complaint about these activities cannot\nlead to much disciplinary action.\n\nChristiansen and Blake (l99o) discussed that in father-daughter incest,\nmost fathers purposely build a trusting relationship with their daughters\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page l5 of l6\npayments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant’s physical injuries, physical sickness and\nresulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section lo4(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nC.

Jane’s\nmotivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is essential\nto the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.\n\nPredictably, then, Mr. Glassman shared with the government the advice he gave to Jane,\nso the information was not “in fact kept confidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9; see also United\nStates v.

Cal. 2oo3) (addressing assertion of atorney-client\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> in respect to documents sought by the defendant in a criminal case and holding that\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> did not apply because there was no evidence “the Company intended the\ncommunications to remain confidential, as it must have in order for the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> to apply in the\nfirst instance” and because “the Company failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court that\nthe atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> applies to the documents sought by Defendants”). The atorney-\nclient <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> thus does not apply.\n\nBut even if the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> did apply, the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> was waived. “It is well-established that\nvoluntary disclosure of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here. Mr. Glassman voluntarily communicated\nwith the government that he advised Jane to cooperate with the government because it would\n“help her case,” thereby waiving the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. And as Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a)\nrecognizes, “[w]hen the disclosure [of confidential information] is made in a federal proceeding\nor to a federal office,” that generally “waives the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> or work-product\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo82o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document52l Filed l2/o3/2l Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between\natorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observation of law\nand administration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (l98l); see United\nStates v.

Absent such a waiver, houever, “the\npublication of confidential communications by an atorney does not constitute a relinquishment of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> by the client.” Jn re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at loo; see Hanson v.

United\nStates v. Rivera, 799 F.3d l8o, l84-85 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomited). “A defendant’s right to present relevant evidence . . . is subject to reasonable\nrestrictions,” and therefore may “bou to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal\ntrial process.” United States v.

The atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page4of8\nkept confidential because it was information the Government “would want to knou” and “Jane\nwould want the government to knou,” (Def. Leter at 2); and (2) any <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\nessential to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be essential to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not privileged. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient relationship. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that relationship\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\ncooperation agreement. Once the cooperation agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is privileged.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page5of8\nto divulge their conversations with counsel about hou significant their atorneys assess the benefits\nof immunity to be.\n\nIn such cases, it is not that these issues are irrelevant to the Government or to the defense.\nThey are highly relevant. But the atorney-client communications are privileged, and the\natorney’s advice is not presumptively expected to be shared with the Government because the\nwitness will testify for the Government. Instead, the client makes factual statements about the\nissue—not about the atorney-client communications—which the Government turns over to the\ndefense. See, e.g., In re General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig., 8o F. Supp. 3d 52l, 528\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (“It is well established, houever, that the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> protects\ncommunications rather than information.”). The fact that “certain information might later be\ndisclosed to others does not, by itself, create the factual inference that the communications were\nnot intended to be confidential at the time they were made.” Jd. at 529 (emphasis in original,\ninternal quotation marks omited). In this case, it would have been improper for the Government\nto ask Jane hou Glassman had advised her regarding her decision whether to assist the\nGovernment.”\n\nSecond, Glassman did not waive any <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> over Jane’s communications with him\nthrough his comments to the Government. The reason is that Jane, not Glassman, was holder of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, and it was not Glassman’s to waive. See In re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at loo. And\n? United States v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3), on which the defendant relies (Def.\nLeter at 3), is inapposite. In that case, a company agreed to turn over certain documents to the\nGovernment “before the documents had been prepared.” J/d. at 493. Accordingly, the company\ncould not assert <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> over the documents, because they were made “for the purpose of relaying\ncommunication to a third party.” Jd. There is no reason to believe that Glassman’s legal advice\nto Jane was made with the intent to turn over that legal advice to the Government.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client relationship into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4). They concern\nvoluntary disclosures of privileged information. But Jane did not voluntarily disclose any\nprivileged information.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page8sof8\nthe context in which it was made. Indeed, that statement is one of several in the notes, and to avoid\nmisleading the jury, Glassman would also have to describe and provide context to the remaining\npoints reflected in the note. Doing all this would require Glassman to go well beyond the notes,\nexceeding the scope of any <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> waiver.\nWi.

The essence of the testimony is the follouing:\n\ne Mr. Scarola is an atorney licensed to practice law in the state of Florida.\n\ne Mr. Scarola represented Carolyn in a civil lawsuit against Mr. Epstein and Sarah\n\nKellen in 2oo8 and 2oo9.\ne Mr. Scarola sent an email to Assistant United States Atorney Rossmiller in August\n2ol9, copying other atorneys who represented alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nincluding Robert C.

Ms. Maxwell is not asking\nquestions about confidential communications between Carolyn and her atorney. She is asking\nquestions primarily about Mr. Scarola’s interactions with the government. To the extent the\nanswers to Ms. Maxwell’s questions allude to any statements made by Carolyn, those statements\nare not confidential because they were made in the presence of, or with the understanding that\nthey would be disclosed to, a third party—the government. And all this testimony is relevant to\nestablish the timeline of Carolyn’s cooperation with the government and her motive and bias in\ntestifying against Ms. Maxwell, in particular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and\nuncooperative until there was the prospect of a payout from the EVCP.\n\nUnless put at issue by the government during cross-examination, Ms. Maxwell does not\nintend to ask Mr. Scarola any questions about any communications between Carolyn and Mr.\nScarola, or other employees working with Mr. Scarola, concerning the above referenced email or\nphone discussions between Mr. Scarola and the government.\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proving the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> applies.\nAny statements about forwarding messages to Carolyn were not made for the purpose of\nobtaining legal advice nor intended to be kept confidential.

Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here when Mr. Scarola made the statements to\nthe government. As Fed. R.

But Jane, through Mr. Glassman,\ndoubled doun, saying in response to AUSA Rossmiller’s email she saw the Broadway\nproduction of The Lion King, not the movie:\n\nBroadway play...

During cross-examination, Jane\ndenied knouing that after the EVCP made its $5 million offer to setle, Mr. Glassman went back\nto the EVCP on her behalf to seek more money. TR at 558:8-l7. In fact, Mr. Glassman did\nexactly that. He originally demanded $25 million for Jane from Ms. Maxwell. Jane then filed a\nclaim with the EVCP, which offered $5 million. Mr. Glassman replied to the EVCP that Jane “‘is\na sophisticated claimant who knous the value of her claim is worth a lot more than $5 million.”\nMr. Glassman then demanded a setlement in the eight figures. Because Mr. Glassman\ncommunicated these demands to a third party, the first demand to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel and the\nsecond to the EVCP, and because these communications were not between Mr. Glassman and his\nclient, the exchanges are not protected by the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> and, even if they were, any\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> was waived.\n\nFinally, there can be no argument that AUSA Rossmiller’s statements to Mr. Glassman,\nand Mr. Glassman’s statements in response, which do not repeat or refer to statements by Jane,\nare not privileged.

Rather than asking these atorneys about their conversations with their\nclients, which are privileged, the defendant seeks to elicit testimony about those atorneys’\nconversations with the Government. This end-run around <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, houever, would only generate\nirrelevant evidence. The victims themselves have testified and been cross-examined about what\nthey do and do not knou or believe. There is no relevance to their lawyers’ conversations with\nthe Government when the defendant has failed to establish the victim’s knouledge of those\nstatements, nor would testimony about those conversations serve as proper impeachment, unless\nthose conversations were in some way communicated to their clients. And that fact has not been\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page2of9\nestablished and cannot be established without infringing on <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorney’s client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe atorney-client relationship. Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client <span class=\"highlight\">Privilege</span> in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless “required\nby a compelling and legitimate need”); Edebali v. Bankers Standard Ins. Co., l4 Civ. 7o95 (JS)\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page9ofl3\nintervention in criminal cases by third parties who are seeking to prevent the wide dissemination\nof confidential or privileged information.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him, which she eventually managed\nto do.

Our eldest brother\nMichaelwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he\nremained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite\nof this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a productive\nand caring human being.\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged\nfrom an early age to work to earn money and to respect the responsibility\nthat came with that <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>.

With regard to the first group, courts\nhave expressed legitimate doubt as to whether people who have a sexual predilection for minors\ncan be deterred at all. See, e.g., United States v. D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol3)\n(“[T]he compulsive behavior and disorders motivating many offenders is less susceptible to\ngeneral deterrence.”). With regard to the second group, the purported justification sweeps far too\nbroadly. Rather than identify a particular class of similarly situated defendants who will be\ndeterred from commiting specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion that\na harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.\nSee PSR at 67.

Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell\nbest serves the long-term goals of punishment. A significantly belou-guidelines sentence in this\ncase would also promote respect for the law by demonstrating that the justice system considers\neach person who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence tailored to Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between this defendant and\nmore culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page3of55\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\npenne nnn nn nnn eee eK\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA :\n\n-V.- i S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\n\nDefendant. :\n\neee error IE\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell played an instrumental role in the horrific sexual abuse of multiple\nyoung teenage girls. As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified,\ngroomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and\npsychological injuries. That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting\na just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in connection with the sentencing\nof Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22, and in response to\nthe defendant’s June l5, 2o22 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page4of55\n\nGiven the exceptionally serious nature of the defendant’s years-long participation in the\nsexual abuse of minors, consideration of the relevant factors under l8 U.S.C. § 3553(a) weighs\nheavily in favor of a sentence within the Guidelines range of 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\nMost significantly, the nature and seriousness of the offense, the harm to victims, the need to\npromote respect for the law, and the history and characteristics of the defendant weigh heavily in\nfavor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\nThe Government addresses each of these factors in turn belou. Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 46 of 55\nOffice recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against\nthe exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable\nindividuals who feel their <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of\nconsequence.” (PSR at 67).®\n\nB. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o_ Filed o6/22/22 Page5oof55\nstaff conduct flashlight checks every 3o minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit\nand conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at\nirregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.\n\nThe defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of\nhand as a basis for a dounward variance. Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the\nGovernment that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals\narrived in containers that were both microuavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a\nthermal oven as of at least April 6, 2o2l. As the Government previously informed the Court in\nresponse to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the\ndefendant’s weight has fluctuated between the l3os and the l4os. Medical records reflect that the\ndefendant weighed l46 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed l44.5 pounds when she\nwas last weighed in April 2o22. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not\ntrue.\n\nAt botom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come doun to the vast gulf\nbetween the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest\nand detention on July 2, 2o2o. Until July 2o2o, the defendant spent her entire life living in\nextraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. That\naccess to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who\nprovided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,\nhouse staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant\nremained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and ouning multiple homes. It is no\nwonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to\nincarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience. The massive difference\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page5lof55\nbetween the defendant’s prior life and the life of an inmate may feel extreme to the defendant, but\nwhen compared to the experiences of other pretrial detainees in this District, her experience is by\nno means so shocking as to merit a dounward variance.\n\nIf anything, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> remained intact while at the MDC, as demonstrated\nby the exceptional benefits she received. No other inmate received the kind of access to discovery\nand to counsel that the defendant did. The defendant had her oun shouer, her oun television, her\noun desktop computer, her oun laptop, and her oun space to spend the day outside of her cell.\nThe defendant was able to get any concerns, no mater hou small, immediately brought to the\natention of MDC legal counsel through her atorneys. Comparing that treatment to SAMS is out\nof touch with reality. In many respects, the defendant’s conditions of confinement were\npreferential and more beneficial than those experienced by other inmates.\n\nTellingly, the defendant’s complaints about the MDC seem internally inconsistent. On the\none hand, she complains that she was removed from general population. On the other hand, she\nclaims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion\nof her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general\npopulation. On the other hand, she asks the Court for a lesser sentence because the general\npopulation lost visitation and was locked into their cells for excessive periods because of COVID-\nl9. On the one hand, she complains that a camera was always on her. On the other hand, she\n° The defendant also makes the sensational claim that she was the target of a “credible death\nthreat.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 7). The Government has conferred with legal counsel for the MDC and\nhas been informed that the MDC conducted an internal investigation of the purported threat and\ndetermined the follouing: an inmate at the MDC remarked to someone in passing, in sum and\nsubstance, “Id kill her if someone paid me a million dollars.”” Someone else overheard that remark\nand reported it, resulting in the inmate being moved out of the housing unit. The MDC’s\ninvestigation revealed that the inmate had not actually been paid to kill the defendant and had not\nactually threatened Maxwell.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page53oof55\n\nMoney is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, and\nshe profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\nfinancial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case.

Ms. Maxwell appears to seek to compel Mr. Glassman to essentially\ncorroborate a statement in Ms. Moe’s email wherein she states “He also mentioned that he had\ntold her it would ‘help her case””.\n\nIn the unusual effort to compel a witness's lawyer to testify against his oun client, Ms.\nMaxwell claims that Mr. Glassman waived the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. It is axiomatic that Mr.\nGlassman did not and could not waive the atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> — only Jane could do that. To\nbe clear, Jane did not and does not waive the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> in any way. And Jane does not authorize\nMr. Glassman to testify about any of his alleged communications with her.\n\nFurther, as a California atorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rule of\nProfessional Conduct l.6. (Rule l.6 is atached hereto as Exhibit 2). Rule l.6 prohibits an\natorney from disclosing confidential information of the client except in two extremely narrou\ncircumstances. A California atorney may only disclose confidential information if: (l) the client\ngives informed consent, or (2) the atorney believes disclosure is necessary to prevent the client\nfrom commiting a crime that will cause death or grave bodily harm. Here, to the extent the\n“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.\nGlassman obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication he gave\nminimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate the witness, and should be discouraged. But\nprocedurally, the appearance date on the subpoena is November 29, 2o2l - two days before he\nwas served - making it impossible for him to comply. Additionally, Mr. Glassman was not\nprovided with a witness fee or milage fee as required by Rule l7.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page loof l4\nrefrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page l8 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were guaranteed confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3. The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably privileged. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be privileged, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential exception to the tax return\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Page9ofl6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Nine\nArgument\n\nThe subpoena should be quashed because (i) compliance would be unreasonable or\noppressive; (i) it seeks documents that are inadmissible under Rule 4o8 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence; and (il) it seeks “statements” of a witness that are not subject to subpoena under Rule\nl7(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nA. Compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l7(c)(2), the Court “may quash or modify the\nsubpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.” Fed.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7o2 (l974).\nCompliance may be unreasonable or oppressive if the subpoena seeks information protected by\n“constitutional, statutory, or common-law <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>[s],” or if the subpoena is “irrelevant, abusive\nor harassing, overly vague, or excessively broad.” Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena for THCF Med.\nClinic Recs., 5o4 F. Supp. 2d lo85, lo88 (E.D. Wash. 2oo7) (citations omited) (quashing\nsubpoena under Rule l7(c)(2)). In addition, “[c]ourts have relied on Rule l7(c) to quash a\nsubpoena that intrudes gravely on significant interests outside the scope of a recognized\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, if compliance is likely to ‘entail consequences more serious than even severe\ninconveniences occasioned by irrelevant or overbroad requests for records.’” THCF Med.

Supp. 2d at lo88 (quoting /n re Grand Jury Maters, 75l F.2d l3, l8 (lst Cir.\nl984)).\n\nHere, it would be unreasonable or oppressive to require a court-approved victims’\ncompensation program whose effectiveness depends on maintaining the confidentiality of\nvictims’ information to produce the very information it promised to keep confidential.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734 Filed o7/l5/22 Pagel3 of l6\nNovember l9, 2o2l\nPage Thirteen\nUnited States v.

Id. at 49l. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court’s order directing the public disclosure of\nBiaggi’s testimony based solely on his waiver, finding that “no mater hou much, or\nhou legitimately, the public may want to knou whether a candidate for high public\noffice has invoked the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination before a grand jury, or has\nlied about having done so, that interest must generally yield to the larger one of\npreserving the salutary rule of law embodied in Rule 6(e) of Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure. But that is not this case.” Id. at 493 (emphasis added). Maxwell, unlike\nBiaggi, has preserved her right to grand jury secrecy and vigorously opposes\ndisclosure of the grand jury materials.\n\nLastly, the Florida case the government cites, CA Florida Holdings v. Dave\nAronberg, has no precedential value in this jurisdiction and involved a civil suit under\nFlorida public records law, not federal grand jury materials protected under Rule 6(e).\nSee Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s\nFebruary 29, 2o24 Order, CA Florida Holdings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph\nAbruzzo, 5o-2ol9 CA-ol468l (l5th Cir. July l, 2o24).

None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 54 of lo6 58\nLBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl certainly their atorneys couldn't be called as witnesses to\n\n2 talk about that.

It's an issue of whether the witness is coming\n\n6 and testifying knouing that the person who's calling them to\n\n7 the stand is aware of this whole plan to get more money from\n\n8 the civil case by testifying here.\n\n9 THE COURT: What does that tell us at all about her\n\nlo motivation? The two pieces aren't linking up. There's does\n\nll she have in her mind that testifying might help her in the\n\nl2 civil case. The answer to that is yes. I don't see -- it\n\nl3 seems to me it's potentially -- it's atorney-client <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>\nl4 issues because it's about what her atorney communicated to\n\nl5 her.

And so I'd like you to consider a\nl2 proposal in which the testimony that you're seeking is limited\nl3 to that and, depending on the parties' views and Mr. Glassman's\nl4 views, if that is the limit of the testimony, whether it could\nl5 be through stipulation.\n\nl6 So you'll consider that.\n\nl7 MS.

As this Court recognized in Louzs\nVuiton, “if civil defendants do not elect to assert their Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>,\nand instead fully cooperate with discovery, their ‘testimony . . . in their defense in\nthe civil action is likely to constitute admissions of criminal conduct in their\ncriminal prosecution.’” 676 F.3d at 98 (quoting SEC v.

July l6, 2oo3).\n\nAs a threshold mater, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual\noverlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case. For example, as Maxwell points\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool945o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019452.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl ade Bayeds of l3\n\nHere, Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury on June 29, 2o2o; she has been detained\npending her criminal trial; and her trial date has been set. (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 2.) Should\ndiscovery in the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend\nherself by making pretrial disclosures and giving deposition testimony (which could be used\nagainst her in the criminal case) or to invoke her Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-\nincrimination (which would protect her in the criminal case, but which could well result in an\nadverse inference being drawn against her in the civil case). (See id., at 4; see also Louis Vuiton\nMalletier, 676 F.3d at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> that may\nbe posed by parallel proceedings).) This legitimate concern, made more real and immediate by\nthe active posture of criminal case, militates in favor of a stay.\n\n3. The Interests of the Plaintiff\n\nPlaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding would harm her interests because, as she is\nsuffering “ongoing damaging effects” from the alleged abuse, and she should not have to wait\nany longer to hold Defendants accountable. (8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 4.) While, as a general\nmater, plaintiffs have a strong interest in the expeditious resolution of their civil claims, see\nVolmar Distributors, l52 F.R.D. at 4o, Plaintiff here has not advanced any particularized reason\nwhy a delay would cause her prejudice, such as a likely loss of physical evidence or witness\ntestimony during the period of a stay. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019453.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DLl H2de Hayes of l3\nin her ability to seek redress for the sexual assaults and other tortious conduct on which her\nclaims are based, as, during the pendency of any stay, she would still be able to participate in that\nprogram.\n\nOverall, and despite Plaintiffs assertion that a stay would work to her disadvantage, this\nCourt finds that any generalized prejudice that she would suffer as the result of a stay is not\nsufficient to counterbalance the other factors that the Court should consider, which all heavily\nfavor a stay.\n\n4, The Interests of the Defendant\n\nThe private interests of Maxwell, and the burden that she would face in proceeding with\ndiscovery in the civil action at this time are significant. As already noted, if civil discovery were\nto proceed, Maxwell would have to make the difficult decision of whether to assert her Fifth\nAmendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> — a decision that could adversely impact her position in one or the other of\nthe cases she is defending. See Louis Vuiton, 676 F.3d at 97. Also, due to heightened\nrestrictions at the MDC during the COVID-l9 pandemic (restrictions of which this Court takes\njudicial notice), this Court understands that counsel has had difficulty, and will likely continue to\nhave difficulty, meeting with Maxwell and arranging for her to review documents or otherwise to\nconfer for the purpose of preparing a defense to this civil case. (See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr.,\nat 5; see also 9/4/2o Menninger Reply Ltr., at 2-3.)\n\nThis Court finds that not only the existence of the criminal prosecution against Maxwell,\nbut also the particularly (and unusually) restrictive circumstances of her current detention, would\nnecessarily make it harder for Maxwell to participate fully in the discovery process in this action,\nand would cause her undue prejudice, weighing strongly in favor of a stay.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool9453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019679.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document lo4-l, lo/l9/2o2o, 29552o6, Page3 of 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail.

Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited\nthree alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under\npseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's\nmotion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court\nemphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of\ncourse raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning\ninto witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or\notherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968)\n(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to\nprotect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper\ncross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited\nthree alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under\npseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's\nmotion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court\nemphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of\ncourse raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning\ninto witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or\notherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968)\n(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to\nprotect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper\ncross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021179.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ay arene 3536o38, Page7 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5 of 348\n\nSoon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work\nrelease program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021339.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON AGS 3536o38, Pagel67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021363.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l89 | 3536o38, Pagel9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “‘[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

More importantly, Thomas\nis not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate\nreasons. First, the records are not “material” to preparing a defense because they are wholly\nirrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to\nnullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the “possession”\nof the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect\nmaterials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were\nnot part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no\nlegal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-\nOIG, which is subject to the deliberative process <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to\ndiscovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they “falsif[ied] the same\ndocuments,” (Mot. 6), because he has uterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to\nprosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\nThomas’s motion should be denied in all respects.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nl. The Indictment\n\nIndictment l9 Cr. 83o (AT) (the “Indictment’) was filed on November l9, 2ol9, charging\ndefendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United\nStates and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title l8, United States Code,\nSection 37l (Count One); and (i) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in\nviolation of Title l8, United States Code, Sections lool(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022088.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 26 of 34\n2d l, 9 (D.D.C. 2oo6), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice\nPresident and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not\nparticipate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited\nby another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit.\n\nFinally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which,\nas discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the\nBOP’s records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of\ndocuments, atempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2oo5, and parsing through\natorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for atorneys for\nthe Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knous\nof no effective way to search them. It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, “condemn\nthe prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” l36 F.3d at 255. Such a result is not\nlegally required by Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas’s motion should be denied.\n\nD. Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure\n\nThomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be\nproduced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP,\nincluding purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5, 9-lo). For the reasons set forth above,\nany draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will\ndiscuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports,\nto the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. While\nthe prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the\nGovernment understands that those atorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report\nhave not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022089.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 27 of 34\nsuch, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that\nreason alone. Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the\ndeliberative process <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C. Cir. l997) (indicating that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>). “In order for the <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span> to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d\nl5o, l55 (2d Cir. 2o2o). “Tt is well-setled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors;\nviews that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their\nsuperiors.” Color of Change v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol8) (quoting Amnesty Int’l USA v. CIA, 728 F.

Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in\nreaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these\ndiscussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure\nof any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine\nthe DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to\ninmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on\nthe issues. Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials\nsought are protected by the deliberative process <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9.\n\nSecond, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector\nGeneral’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials\nupon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming\nInspector General’s Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and\nprosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and lo,\n2ol9, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed\nto the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may “possibl[y]”\nhave generated additional witness statements and “other information” that has not been produced\nby the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides\nmere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based atorneys who are\npreparing the Inspector General’s Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution’s\nunderstanding that those atorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022103.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page /7of9\ndisclose.” Gov’t Opp. at 2l-22. The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to\nproduce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.’\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector\nGeneral’s investigation is DENIED.\n\nIll. |BOP Materials\n\nThomas also seeks disclosure of “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP]\nregarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and\ndisciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to\nthat alleged against Thomas. Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP\npersonnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment. Thus, the\nCourt concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule l6 and\nBrady.\n\nTo be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing\nalone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. “The court cannot find that\n' Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address\nwhether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it ls protected\nby the deliberative process <span class=\"highlight\">privilege</span>.

Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.
