United States v.\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under\nthis test, an indictment need do litle more than to\ntrack the language of the statute charged and state the\ntime and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v.

In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> permits a\ndefendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to\nidentify with sufficient particularity the nature of\nthe charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and\nto interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United\nStates v. Bortnovusky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of\neach charged crime and the facts supporting each\nelement. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the\nindictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended\ntime periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does\nnot identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the\nGovernment need only describe the time and place of\ncharged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti,\n5l3 F.2d at ll8. The details are subject to proof at\ntrial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on\nor about’ language used to describe the windou of\nwhen a violation occurred.” United States v.

Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)).\n“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of\nchildren: allegations of sexual abuse of underage\nvictims often proceed without specific dates of the\noffenses.” United States v.

A defendant seeking severance must shou\nsignificant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the\ncourt of conducting multiple trials. United States v.\nWalker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to\nthe defendant must be more than “solely the adverse\neffect of being tried for two crimes rather than one.”\nUnited States v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir.\nl98o). Though this standard is demanding, the Court\nconcludes that, due to unique features of the perjury\ncounts, Maxwell meets it here. Trying all counts\ntogether would compromise Maxwell’s right to the\ncounsel of her choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann\nAct counts would risk an unfair trial on each set of\ncounts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations\nof sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the\njury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the\njury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s\ncharged conduct. This presents a significant risk that\nthe jury will cumulate the evidence of the various\ncrimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\nseparately, it would not do so. See United States v.\nHalper, 59o F.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the\nevidence presented on the Mann Act counts may\nprejudice the jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s\ntruthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of the\nperjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000144.jpg": "8la\nStates v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d lo64, lo7o-7l (2d Cir.\nl982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden\nseparate trials may impose on all trial participants.\nBut much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts\nand the Mann Act counts does not overlap. In\nparticular, materiality for statements made in a civil\ndeposition is broad, and evidence on that question is\nunlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross,\nl4 F.3d at 753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 US. at 5o9. Although\nsome allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to both\nsets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will\nexpand the scope of the trial far beyond the narrouer\nissues presented. And while the Court agrees with the\nGovernment that at least some of Maxwell’s concerns\nare overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action\nwill require a significant investment of time and\nresources to provide the requisite context.\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance.\n“Motions to sever are commited to the sound discretion of\nthe trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d\nll4l, ll49 (2d Cir. l989). In its discretion, the Court\nconcludes that trying the perjury counts separately\nwill best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all\ncharges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is\n\npremature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to\none of the alleged victims from the Sl superseding\nindictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so\nat this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7(d) allous a\ncourt to strike surplusage from an indictment on a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added). Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably motivated and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations.

The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . .

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo988", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001094.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel53 of 2oo 9o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl evidentiary hearing within one week. In contrast, the\n\n2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted\n\n3 defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access\n\n4 counsel. Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees\n\n5 currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would\n\n6 need to be released to prepare their defense. To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 atorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys. There is ongoing litigation before\n\nll Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the\n\nl2 adequacy of atorney-client access at the MDC. That is case\n\nl3 No. l9 Civ. 66o. Public filings from the court-appointed\n\nl4 mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone\nl5 calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of\n\nl6 reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their\n\nl7 counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently\nl8 developing a plan to resume in-person atorney-client visits in\nl9 the near future.\n2o At this stage in this case and at this point in the\n2l pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to\n22 ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel. To further\n23 assuage these concerns, the court orders the government in this\n24 case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the\n25 defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo94", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001101.jpg": "Caseel24o/CROOBBOHASN ADSUMENT/ID2 FileG6RAIA/PagPage of @o45\nStatutes\nRules\nRule 5(F) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ..................o..ccccccecccseceee cee eens seeeseeteeseeeesneeeee D\niV\nDOJ-OGR-oooollol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001107.jpg": "Cased 2o-C€FQd3GouAUNt Dibeute/ntl $7o 2Ail ed 42SBM/ 26a cedgs bi 2o5\ncontest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France.” We also provide\nopinions from experts in the extradition laws of the France and the United Kingdom\nstating that it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to resist extradition\nfrom either country in the event she were granted bail and somehou fled to either\ncountry, which she has no intention of doing. Their opinions also state that any\nextradition proceeding would be resolved promptly. (Exs. T-V).\n\n¢ Lack of corroborating evidence. The government represented to the Court that it\nhad “contemporaneous documents,” including “diary entries” in support of its case.\n(Dkt. 4 at 5). The defense has nou reviewed the discovery produced to date,\nincluding all of the documents that the government described as the core of its case\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As explained more fully belou, the discovery contains no\nmeaningful documentary corroboration as to Maxwell and only a small number of\ndocuments from the time period of the conspiracy charged in the indictment. As an\nexample, the government produced onl\n3\nThe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration\nonly reinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and\nstrengthens her long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear\nher name in court.\n¢ Oppressive conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n? Ms. Maxwell has not yet signed these waivers because we have not been able to visit her in the MDC to obtain her\nsignature since she was quarantined over two weeks ago.

(Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001126.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt Dibeutre/otl $7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a edge 3o 2o45\nAccording to a. the security guard on duty that day had seen helicopters flying\nover the house, which he assumed to be the press. V/d.). When the guard saw the FBI\nagents walking up the driveway to the house, he again assumed that they were members of\nthe press. U/d.). Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that the press was on the\ngrounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest: she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the discovery produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001162.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n DieGmMehol ooo AFiled 425o8)/26a Ragec?d Gb 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

(/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n4/39). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v.

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset.

The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001252.jpg": "Cesa5@:2o-¢7ooB3o:AUaht Docume W262i, PIEADZOPAde lPagd l4F 2\nMINISTERE a ae ;\nDE LA JUSTICE Direction des affaires criminelles et des graces\nLiberte\nEgatite\nFraternite\nSous-direction de la justice penale specialisee\nBureau de l’entraide penale internationale .\nP Paris, le 9 mars 2o2l\nMonsieur le garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice\na\nDepartment of Justice (D.O,J)\nPar lintermediaire d’ Andrew FINKELMAN, magistrat de haison\nAmbassade des Etats-Unis d “Amerique a Paris\nJ'ai Thonneur de porter 4 votre connaissance que la <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> et les conditions\n@extradition sont regies en France par les articles 696 et suivants du code de <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> penale.\nLarticle 696-2 de ce code prevoit ainsi que « /e gouvernement francais peut remetre, sur leur\ndemande, aux fouverncments trangers, toute personne n'ayant pas la nationalite francaise qui, etant l'objet d'une\npoursuite intentee au nom de I'Etat requerant ou d'une condamnation prononcee par ses tribunaux, est trouvee sur\nke territoire de la Republique. »\nVarticle 694-4 precise expfessement que :\n« L' extradition n'est pas accordee :\nl° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite Jrangaise, cete detniere etant appreciee a\nI'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\ns\\insl, le fait que la personne recherchee ait la nationalite frangaise constitue un obstacle\ninsurmontable 4 son extradition.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly.

In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22.

The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court\nshould have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.” Christy, 739 F.3d at 539.\nConsequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to\nreconsider.” Federated Touing & Recovery, LLC v.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001348.jpg": "Casest:2o-cr/oo88GAUNnt BOcument B2o FiledOl2/o7 Re aBage a 2\ninmates are breathing and not in distress. Inmates in BOP custody are subject to searches, including\nbody scanners, and inmates may be searched prior to moving from one area of the facility to another.\nThe removal of Ms. Maxwell’s face mask complies with the BOP’s COVID-l9 Pandemic Response Plan.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s arrival, she has been provided three (3) meals a day in accordance with BOP\npolicy and its National Menu. Food Service staff have addressed Ms. Maxwell’s requests. Ms. Maxwell ls\nsetved her breakfast upon entering the common area of the housing unit at 7:oo AM; at noon she is\nserved her lunch; and at 5:oo PM she ts served dinner. Her medical records shou that she currently\nweighs l34 Ibs., which fluctuates plus or minus 2 lbs. Health Services staff make regular rounds of her\nhousing unit and she has been instructed on hou to request medical care through the sick call\nprocedures. Furthermore, while there has been a number of inmates whom have tested positive for\nCOVID-l9, Ms. Maxwell remains in good health and is not in contact with those individuals. The BOP\nstaff is assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s unit do not come in contact with the other individuals whom have\ntested positive. Lastly, the temperature of Ms. Maxwell’s cell is checked three times daily to ensure it ls\nin compliance with national standards.\n\nIn accordance with the BOP’s COVID-l9 Pandemic Response Plan, inmates are alloted 5oo\nminutes per month of social telephone calls, which Ms. Maxwell has used throughout her time at MDC\nBrooklyn. While Ms. Maxwell has received one legal video conference, she continues to have full access\nto legal telephone calls and in person legal visits. Pursuant to the District Courts guidance, legal\ntelephone calls are scheduled through the Federal Defenders, who should be afforded an opportunity to\naddress any concerns Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have with the legal calls.\n\nI trust this has addressed your concerns.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Sophia Papapetru\n\nSophia Papapetru\n\nStaff Atorney\n\nMDC Brooklyn\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n\n/s/ John Wallace\n\nJohn Wallace\n\nStaff Atorney\n\nMDC Brooklyn\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nDOJ-OGR-ooool348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001387.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 57, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagel5 of 3o\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\nI CERTIFY that this petition complies with the type-volume\nlimitation of FED.

Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-\ntrial detainees can be reduced.

STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool439", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001455.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel5 of 24\nabuse of discretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool455", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001456.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. l, 6 (l95l) (explaining,\nbefore passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for challenging\nbail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of\nAppeals from an order denying such motion”). The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool456", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001458.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel8 of 24\n\n34. Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell. Unlike most other inmates,\nMaxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and\nMaxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress\nof which increases the possibility that she may self-harm. Moreover, as Judge\nNathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001459.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool459", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001460.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001464.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page24 of 24\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page l of l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 3 of 3\nstake. And as the Government’s leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense\nneeds an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make\napplications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use\ndiscovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal\nmaters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions\nincluding Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and\nother policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follou.\nFurthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with\nmaterials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of\ncourse, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to\nwhat materials were provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense’s\npapers explains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order,\nwhich will be entered on the docket.\n\nThis resolves Dkt.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal.

The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\ndisclosure obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for disclosure of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing Disclosure of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe disclosure obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s\nOctober 6, 2o2o leter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs\nand documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the\n“Materials”), pursuant to Rule l6(d)(l) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. (Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that yesterday we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 4\ninvestigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is\nsignificant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at\ntrial.®\n\nWe assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or\nbenefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the\nclaimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The\nGovernment presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which\n“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful\nto impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. l9-CR-696\n(PAE), 2o2o WL 3o34o34, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2o2o) (citations omited), see also, Bagley\nv. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d l297, l3ol (9th Cir. l986); United States v. Librach, 52o F.2d 55o, 554\n(8th Cir. l975).\n\nThe Government is the Team\n\nIn an atempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is\non the Team. The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations\nby either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Atorney unless\npart of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record\nassurances that it gave the Court on July l4, 2o2o:\n\n“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files\n\nfrom another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. l2:lo-l3\n\n“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at\n\nthe New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to\n\nmake sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New\n\nYork so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., l4:lo-l4\n\nNou, the Government seeks to distance itself from its oun files, which are in New York,\nnot Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it\n6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding discovery, Ms. Maxwell, on October l3, 2o2o, sent a detailed\nleter requesting the production of discovery materials under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>,\nBrady v.

We assume the parties’ familiarity with the\nunderlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over the “final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § l29l.\n“Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>.”\nCobbledick v. United States, 3o9 U.S. 323, 324 (l94o). The “final judgment rule requires that a party\nmust ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal follouing final judgment on the merits.”\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (l984) (internal quotation marks omited). “This\ninsistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-\nfooted administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases.” D7 Bella v.\nUnited States, 369 U.S. l2l, l24 (l962) (citing Cobbledick, 3o9 U.S. at 324-26). The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). The Supreme Court has described the\n“conditions for collateral order appeal as seringenf’ in general, Digital Equip.

These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial.

The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial.

You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

Food Service staff have addressed Ms. Maxwell’s requests. Ms. Maxwell ls\nsetved her breakfast upon entering the common area of the housing unit at 7:oo AM; at noon she is\nserved her lunch; and at 5:oo PM she ts served dinner.

Health Services staff make regular rounds of her\nhousing unit and she has been instructed on hou to request medical care through the sick call\nprocedures. Furthermore, while there has been a number of inmates whom have tested positive for\nCOVID-l9, Ms. Maxwell remains in good health and is not in contact with those individuals.

And so I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.” A source said the\n\nBOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust and confidence as\n\nwell as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.”\n\nWhat is clear is that the Government is “livid” over the death of Epstein and is seeking to\nrepair its reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions; not in any\nresponse to Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a\ncompletely different defendant.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee who has never received a disciplinary\ndemerit. The purpose of this leter is not simply to express complaint due to the institutional\nviolations and denial of rights suffered by Ms. Maxwell in relation to her pretrial incarceration.\nRather, it seeks to bring an unwarranted situation to your atention - conditions that are unduly\ncruel and punitive and circumstances that are deleteriously impacting our client’s ability to\nprepare her defense which, in turn, interferes with our ability to provide the legal representation\nto which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nWe continue our ongoing atempt to resolve these maters without court intervention. We\nhave voiced complaint through the MDC Legal Department, your office, the AUSAs in charge\nof this case, and the Federal Defenders of New York.* Ms. Maxwell has atempted to resolve\nthese maters by follouing the internal prison procedures, filing writen complaints to her unit\ncounselor (BP8), to the warden (BP9), and to the regional office (BP lo), to seek remediation as\nset forth in the BOP manuals and inmate handbook. All to no avail.\n\nDraconian Conditions of Pretrial Detention\n\nMs. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous - and unlike those\nof any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knouledge). In fact, in the time that\nMs. Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with five separate wardens and interim wardens,\nmany who have remarked that they have never seen in their collective years of experience\n* See, “Ghislaine Maxwell given paper clothes at correctional center to avoid suicide atempt: Sources\nJeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail last August.”’ btps://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-\nmaxwell-paper-clothes-correctional-center-avoid-suicide/story?id=7l699ooo (emphasis added).\n> The Federal Defenders of New York has been tasked with scheduling of atorney-client communication\nin connection with ongoing litigation against the MDC based on conditions of confinement during\nCOVID pending in the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Margo K.

To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 atorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys.

While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from\nP| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing.

In accordance with the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that Ms.\nMaxwell’s security personnel had put in place for such an event, Ms. Maxwell moved away\nfrom the windous and into a safe room inside the house.

Ms. Maxwell was not trying\nto avoid arrest; she was simply follouing the established security protocols to protect herself\nfrom what had been informed was an ambush by the press.\n\nRegarding the cellphone wrapped in tin foil, we explained to the Court at the initial\nbail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step to prevent the press from accessing her phone\nafter the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number\nunredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the discovery produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered. It would make\nno sense for her to try to wrap one phone in tin foil to avoid detection and not the other.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l5 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4 of lo\nIndependent Accountants’ Commentary\nCohen & Gresser LLP\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, New York loo22\n\nl.

The timescales applicable to extradition proceedings are defined by statute and are set out in Annex D,\nalong with the circumstances in which the time-limits can be extended.\n\nl3. There are few publicly available figures with respect to the timescales in Part 2 extradition cases in\ngeneral, and none with respect to US extradition cases. In July 2ol3, the UK Government estimated that,\non average, Part 2 extradition cases took approximately lo months to conclude*’. In practice, contested\nUS extradition cases can take longer than lo months, although the majority conclude within two years.\n\nl4. These timescales are significantly reduced in cases such as this one where the requested person consents\nto his or her extradition at an early stage in the process. In those cases, extradition would be likely to take\nplace within three months.\n\nB. Consent to extradition\n\nl5. At the initial hearing where a requested person is first produced before the court, the appropriate judge is\nrequired to give them “the required information about consent”’**. This information is: (a) that the person\nmay consent to extradition; (b) an explanation of the effect of consent and the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that will apply if\nconsent is given; and (c) that consent must be given in writing and is irrevocable”.\n\nl6. Where consent is given before the case has been sent to the Secretary of State, it must be given at a\nhearing before the appropriate judge*’. Once the case has been sent to the Secretary of State, consent must\nbe given to the Secretary of State*!.\n\nl7.

In all extradition cases, a requested person who consents to extradition loses the right to appeal against\neither the decision to send the case to the Secretary of State or the order for extradition®®.,\n\nl9. The main effect of a decision by a requested person to consent to extradition is that the overall extradition\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> is substantially shortened. In the context of US extradition cases, this means that removal can\ntake place within months, sometimes weeks, as compared to the longer timescales considered above.\n\nC. Bail in extradition cases\n\n2o. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person\nhas the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption\nthat bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act l976 applies”’. The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.\n\n“ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. l28(4).\n\n*’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s.95(2).

With respect to France, we have been informed\nthat France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States.””.\n\n2.

Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States.

Under Article l3.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, in case of\nurgency, the requesting State may seek the provisional arrest of the person sought\npending the presentation of the request for extradition®.\n\n8. This <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> can be summarized as follous:\n\n- Based on a request for provisional arrest, the Prosecutor General may order the\narrest of the requested person.\n\n- Upon arrest, the requested person must appear within 48 hours before the Prosecutor\nGeneral, who informs him/her of the existence and contents of the request for\ntemporary arrest and of his/her rights.\n\n- The Prosecutor may decide to release the requested person, based on the relevant\nflight risks.\n\n- If the Prosecutor considers that the requested person should be detained, the\nrequested person appears before the l“ President of the Court of appeal, who can\ndecide to order either his/her release (without any control, or under judicial\n\n3 The Extradition Treaty between the USA and France entered into force in France on February l, 2oo2 (by Decree\nn° 2oo2-ll7 of 29 January 2oo2).\n4 The object of this agreement is “to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of applicable\nextradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America governing extradition of\noffenders” (Article l).\n> The Instrument Amending the Treaty of April 23, l996 between the USA and France entered into force in France\non February l, 2olo (by Decree n° 2olo-49o of l2 May 2olo).\n® A request for provisional arrest may be transmited directly between the United States Department of Justice\n(hereafter, “DOJ”’) and the Ministry of Justice of the French Republic, through INTERPOL or the diplomatic\nchannel.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 6\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nsupervision, or under house arrest with electronic surveillance) or incarceration at\nthe remand prison of the Court of appeal in which jurisdiction he/she has been\napprehended.\n\n- The decision of the l“ President of the Court of Appeal can be challenged before\nthe Investigating Chamber of the Court of Appeal.\n\n- Incase of incarceration, the requested person can file an application for release\nbefore the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal at any time during the\nextradition <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>.\n\n9. Under Article l3.4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, if, within 6o\ndays of arrest, the government of the requested State has not received from the requesting\nState the formal extradition request as well as supporting documents required by the\nTreaty’, the requested person is discharged from custody.

Article lo.l of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that “all\nrequests for extradition shall be submited through the diplomatic channel”.\n\nl2. The Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not specify which internal\nprocedures must be folloued in each contracting State follouing the transmission of the\nextradition request through the diplomatic channel pursuant to Article lo. We must\ntherefore refer to provisions of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> to outline the\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> folloued by French institutions upon receipt of an extradition request made\nby the USA.\n\nl3.

The Minister of Foreign\nAffairs only verifies that the request contains all the required documents.\n\n- The file is then transmited to the Minister of Justice, which verifies the regularity\nof the request. At this stage, the French nationality of the requested person does not\ninfluence the control of the Minister of Justice.\n\n- The Minister of Justice must then forward the file to the Prosecutor General. This\nobligation to transmit the file to the Prosecutor General is binding, as Article 696-9\nuses imperative language requiring the Minister of Justice to do so.\n\nC. Third stage: Arrest and presentation before the Prosecutor General (beginning of\nthe judicial phase)\nl4. Any person arrested pursuant to an extradition application must be transferred to the\nterritorially competent Prosecutor General within 48 hours after the arrest®.\nl5. The Prosecutor General informs the requested person, in a language he or she\nunderstands, of:\n\n- the existence and the content of the extradition application;\n\n- the right to be assisted by an advocate and to have an interview with this advocate\nimmediately;\n\n- the right to consent to or to oppose his or her extradition, and the legal consequences\nof consenting to extradition;\n\n- the right to waive the principle of specialty (according to which the person who is\nextradited can be prosecuted only for the crimes specified in the extradition request),\nand the legal consequences of such renunciation.\n\nl6. The Prosecutor General hears the statements of the person and his or her counsel, and in\n\nparticular, the consent or opposition to extradition, which shall be officially recorded.\nl7. The Prosecutor General decides whether to release the requested person or not. If he\nconsiders that the requested person should remain in detention, the requested person then\nappears before the l President of the Court of appeal, who may order the person’s\nrelease (without any control, or with judicial supervision, or under house arrest with\nelectronic surveillance) or his/her incarceration.

Once the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General whether he consents\nor not to extradition, the Investigating Chamber is immediately seized of the case. This\nphase varies depending on whether the requested person consents to extradition.\n\nl9.

If, at this appearance, the requested person confirms his or her consent to be extradited\nand the legal conditions for extradition are fulfilled, the Investigating Chamber informs\nthe person of the legal consequences of such consent and formally acknouledges this\nconsent within 7 days from the date of appearance, unless additional investigations have\nbeen ordered’,\n\n2l. The rules of this simplified extradition <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> must be read in light of Article ll of\nthe Agreement on Extradition between the European Union and the USA of 25 June\n2oo3 (“Simplified extradition procedures”), which states that “if the person sought\nconsents to be surrendered to the requesting State, the requested State may, in\naccordance with the principles and procedures provided for under its legal system,\nsurrender the person as expeditiously as possible without further proceedings. The\nconsent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule\nof specialty”!°.

If the requested person reiterates to the Investigating Chamber that he or she does not\nconsent to extradition, the Court delivers a reasoned opinion on the extradition request.\nUnless additional investigations have been ordered, the Court delivers its opinion within\none month from the requested person's appearance before it’.\n\n25. The Investigating Chamber may authorize the requesting State to participate in the\nhearing. This possibility is expressly provided for in the Agreed Minute on\nRepresentation annexed to the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France.\n\n26. The Investigating Chamber issues a positive opinion if it considers that the legal\nrequirements of extradition are satisfied.\n\nE. Fifth stage: Decision of the French government\n\n27. Extradition is authorized by a decree of the French Prime Minister upon the advice of\nthe Minister of Justice.\n\n28. The decree may impose conditions to authorize extradition, such as guarantees not to\nseek or impose the death penalty against the requested person.\n\n29.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\nlegislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international\nconvention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought\nshall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordee : l° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite francaise, cete\nderniere etant appreciee a l'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>: “In the absence of an international convention stipulating\notherwise, the conditions, <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.\nThese provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by international conventions”.

The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory. This is\nparticularly the case of the United States of America.\n\nl3, place Vendeme - 75o42 Paris Cedex ol\nTelephone: ol 44 77 6o 6o\nwww.justice-gouv.fr\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l2 of l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l3 of l5\nas Mr. Julie’s accompanying rebutal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ leter ignores that the\nextradition provisions in French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> apply only in the absence of an\ninternational agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at l). This rule is necessitated by the French\nConstitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).\nThus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition\ntreaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n439). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 4]3).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions’). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’). It follous from these provisions that the key question is whether France may\nextradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or\nunder the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France\nextradites its citizens under French legislation.\nIn accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of ll March 2oo4,\npublished by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying hou the then recently\namended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the\nfollouing: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> reaffirms this principle of\n' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-l to Article 696-47-l of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>,\nand thus includes Article 696-2.\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v.

While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national.

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell’s notice of appeal of that order must be filed on or before\nMonday, January ll, 2o2l.\n\nThere is good cause for an extension here. Ms. Maxwell is considering whether to submit\na third bail application to the Court, which would propose even more stringent and restrictive bail\nconditions than those proposed in the renewed bail application. The requested extension will give\nMs. Maxwell the opportunity to research whether and to what extent these additional conditions\nare legally and practicably available, without forfeiting as untimely a possible appeal from the\nCourt’s December 28 Order denying the renewed bail application. The additional time is also\nwarranted because it will enable the defense to continue its review of recently produced\ndocuments and to file our pretrial motions (each of which may bear on the merits of a possible\nthird bail application); to research whether an appeal of the December 28 Order might deprive this\nCourt of jurisdiction to address a third bail application; and because of logistical challenges posed\nby the continued effects of the pandemic.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo226l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo9 Filed ol/o8/2l Page 2 of 2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Counts Five and Six (the “Perjury Counts”)\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell commited perjury in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § l623 by testifying falsely at two separate civil depositions—one on\nApril 22, 2ol6 (Count Five) and the other on July 22, 2ol6 (Count Six). /d. 9 2l, 23.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nA. Joinder of Offenses\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> provides, in relevant part,\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a\ndefendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses\ncharged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\nconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\nRule 8(a) sets forth three different circumstances in which separate offenses may be\nproperly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (l) “are of the same or\nsimilar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. l98o) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial\nconvenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for\njoinder”).\n\nIn conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish\n‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l7 of l9\nto present “some overlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both\ncharges).\n\nFinally, severance is appropriate because a joint trial including the Perjury Counts will\nnecessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility, even if she decides to\nassert her Fifth Amendment right not to testify. By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of 8\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) in this case is remarkable because it fails to\nidentify an accuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or\nwhen anything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in\nthe Indictment are the years l994-l997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or\nabout” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not\nprovide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false\nallegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about\nwhat evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly\nrefuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the\nIndictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of\nParticulars.\nARGUMENT\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7(c)(l) requires, among other things, that an\nindictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an\nindictment to be sufficient: (l) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the\ndefendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”\nUnited States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (quoting Hamling v. United States,\n4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974)).

After noting certain details of the\ninvestigation and indictment by the Florida State Atorney’s Office, the recitals state, among\nother things, that (l) the “United States Atorney’s Office” and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) have “conducted their oun investigation into Epstein’s background and\nany offenses that may have been commited by Epstein against the United States from in or\naround 2ool through in or around September 2oo7, including” five enumerated federal criminal\noffenses; (ll) Epstein seeks “to resolve globally his state and federal criminal liability” and thus\nis agreeing to comply with the terms of the NPA “in exchange for the benefits provided by this\nagreement”; and (i) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the Defendant\nwill be served by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>.” NPA at l-2 (emphasis added). Nouhere in the\nrecitals is reference made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any\nsuggestion that the parties in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of Epstein’s\nliability.\n\nThe NPA then provides that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offenses\nshall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by”\nthe terms of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after its terms are fulfilled,\n\nno prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement [e.g.,\n\nthe five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have been the\n\nsubject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the\n\nUnited States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from the Federal\n\nGrand Jury investigation’ will be instituted in this District, and the charges\n\nagainst Epstein if any, will be dismissed.\n\n3 Like the various references to the United States and its agents, the term “Federal Grand Jury investigation” is not\ndefined in the NPA.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2586", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 38\nId. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5.

Ms.\nMaxwell has been prevented from knouing even the most fundamental information about the\nallegations against her, which are based on conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago.\nFirst and foremost, the government still has not disclosed the identities of the witnesses who\nhave accused Ms. Maxwell of wrongdoing. Despite requests to the government to disclose that\ncritical information, the government has refused to do so on the grounds that it needed to protect\nthe witness’ privacy, even though some of them, we believe, have publicly identified themselves\n' By leters, emails, and phone calls with government counsel, the parties have atempted to resolve pretrial\ndiscovery requests in advance of filing of pretrial motions. Unresolved requests are the subject of this motion. The\ndefense will continue to atempt to resolve disclosure issues with the government as they arise.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2698", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\nthe defense can adequately prepare for trial”)). For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987). The decision of whether to grant a bill of particulars is within the discretion of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 23\n\nFor these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court order the government to\nimmediately disclose all favorable evidence (Brady and Giglio material) within its\npossession and to immediately disclose all such material upon future discovery or receipt, to\nprovide the defense will have ample opportunity to make use of it at trial.\nIV. Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine\n\nAdmissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding\nstatements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey\nEpstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell\nin the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be\ntestimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,\n54l US. 36 (2oo4). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time\nof trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-\nconspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 59o F.2d 575\n(5™ Cir. l979).\n\nThe Second Circuit instructs courts to follou the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> enunciated in United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6 (2d Cir. l969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements\nproffered as coconspirator statements may be admited in evidence on a conditional basis,\nsubject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for\nadmission. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Should the government\nfail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admited co-\nconspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any\ncautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002711.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l8 of 23\nstatements they already heard. Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974). The circumstances of this case — the age of the offenses, the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 4 of 9\nl. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2735", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 3 of 9\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality).

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so.

Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22.

Here, Schuite’s | |\nallegations of systematic exclusion center almost entirely on the juror selection procedures for ,\nthe White Plains master wheel.* See infra l5-l7. Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory law leaves\n4 For example, if Schulte had alleged that the juror questionnaire form displayed systematic\nexclusion, see supra 4n. l, then the qualified wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for\ncomparison.

But the Court will not assume or infer that this District has been\noperating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since 2oo9. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 659 :\n(rejecting Equal Protection challenge due to lack of evidence shouing intentional\ndiscrimination). Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal Protection claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions. LaChance, 788 F.2d\nat 87o, “Mere technical violations of the procedures prescribed by the Act do not constitute :\nsubstantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for\ndifferentiating between a substantial and technical error turns on the “nature and extent of its |\neffects[.]” Id. The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at l9.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the exclusion of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion\nprong of the Sixth Amendment analysis. See supra l5-l7. But because Schulte pleads these |\ndefects as separate violations of the JSSA, the Court conducts a separate analysis here. |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2839", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl9l Filed o3/3o/2l Pagelof7\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\nteen FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transportation of (and conspiracy to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997.

For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that\nthe Court (l) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena\nto BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule l7(c) returnable\nin advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule l7(c) subpoenas\nbe produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order.\nI. Background\nAs the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million\npages of discovery pursuant to the Government’s various discovery obligations, including Rule\nl6. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government,\nincluding material provided pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo and Giglio material.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo289o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002891.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page2ofll\nPage 2\n\nThose obligations, and not Rule l7 subpoenas, provide the avenue through which\ndefendants in criminal cases obtain discovery. As the Supreme Court has explained, “i]t was not\nintended by Rule l6 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule l7 to give a right of\ndiscovery in the broadest terms.” Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l);\nsee also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d l363, l368 (2d Cir. l973) (“A subpoena duces tecum in\na criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery.”). Unlike the rules of civil <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>—\npermiting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although\nthemselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize\nthe issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule l7. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F.\nSupp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. l38, l4l (S.D.N.Y. l959)\n(Rule l7(c) cannot be used “to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence\nor to seek information relating to the defendant’s case. This type of discovery, permissible under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, has not been authorized for criminal trials.”).\n\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to “expedite the trial by providing a time and place before\ntrial for the inspection of” specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence. See\nUnited States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9 Cr. 472 (PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6,\n2o2l) (citing Bouman Dairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22o (l95l)); see also United States v.

Neb. 2oo3) (surveying the caselaw and adopting the “majority\nview” that Rule l7(c) “does not ordinarily permit the use of ex parte applications by the\ngovernment or the defense for subpoenas seeking pretrial production of documents unless the sole\npurpose of seeking the documents is for use at trial,” and even then, only if “there is a good trial-\nrelated reason” and generally requiring production in the presence of the opposing party); 2 Wright\n& Miller, Fed. Prac. & <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> § 275 (4\" ed.) (“It has been held, houever, that in limited\ncircumstances, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte application for a pre-\ntrial subpoena duces tecum” (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2o2o WL 6939677 at *8 (“Courts\nin this District have long folloued the practice of permiting both the defense and the Government\nto submit ex parte applications for Rule l7(c) subpoenas.”); United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D.\n468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995) (permiting ex parte applications because a party must “detail its trial\nstrategy or witness list in order to convince a court that the subpoena satisfies the Nixon\nstandards”). Notice of Rule l7(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse\nand address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language\nof Rule l7: while Rule l7(b) expressly provides for an ex parte <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for indigent defendants\nseeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the\nproduction of documents and objects pursuant to Rule l7(c).4\n\n‘In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule l7(c) is simply an extension of Rules l7(a) and (b)’s\nprovisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2o2o WL 6939677, at\n*8 (quoting United States v. Florack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. l993)). Houever, Rule l7(c)\nsubpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable\nbefore trial, and Rule l7(c)’s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena\nmay be returnable to the Court, which may in turn “permit the parties and their atorneys to inspect\nall or part of them,” and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash.

Indeed, the defendant has\nalready sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government’s interests\nby expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications\nwith the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears\nthat the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which\nplainly runs afoul of the Nixon test. (Leter from BSF to the Court at 2, Dkt. No. l9l).° Insofar\nas the defendant is atempting to engage in such an improper expedition in this case—or even if\nthe defendant is merely pushing the limits of a Rule l7 subpoena—the Government respectfully\nsubmits that it should be afforded the opportunity to bring its concerns to the Court’s atention.\n\nThe Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of a defendant’s\nexplanation for why a particular request in a particular subpoena meets the Nixon standard, may\nreveal critical defense strategy meriting ex parte consideration by the Court. But the Government\nrespectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the\nparticular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permited\nto proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule l7(c).\n(emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, l62 F.R.D. 468, 47o (S.D.N.Y. l995) (“Rules l7(a)\nand l7(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance\nas to the proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum.”). These procedures are,\nat a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding ex parte or under the rules that govern subpoenas\nfor trial testimony.\n> The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court’s\nMarch 24, 2o2l Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2o2l. To the extent the defendant did\nfile such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the\nGovernment is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF\nsubpoena.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2897", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 79 of 239\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish That the Government Delayed the\nIndictment for An Improper Purpose\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay.*® See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong.”). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.’” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\nl6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which provides ample information about the\ncharged crimes and the victims referenced in the Indictment. Additionally, many of the\ndefendant’s requests fall within the scope of the Government’s Giglio and Jencks Act obligations,\nwhich the Government intends to produce at the appropriate stage in the litigation, well in advance\nof trial.\n°° The defendant invites the Court to engage in a balancing test that weighs the prejudice to the\ndefendant against the Government’s reasons for delay. (Def. Mot. 7 at 5,6 n.4). This Court should\nreject the defendant’s invitation. The defendant cites United States v. Brand, 556 F.2d l3l2, l3l7\nn.7 (Sth Cir. l977), for the proposition that a shouing of prejudice triggers such balancing. (Def.\nMot. 7 at 5). Houever, the Fifth Circuit subsequently rejected such a balancing test, finding that\nthe “Brand footnote is pure dicta” and instead requiring that defendants demonstrate that the\nprosecution intentionally caused the delay to gain a tactical advantage over the defendant or “for\nsome other bad faith purpose.” United States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d l497, l5o9, l5l2 (Sth Cir. l996).\nThe defendant also cites that several Circuit courts, namely the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth\nCircuits, require such a balancing test. (Def. Mot. 7 at 6n.4). The Second Circuit, houever, “has\nnot adopted any balancing test, as the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have, and its\nJurisprudence suggests that it would not do so.” United States v.

The argument, which relies principally on hyperbolic rhetoric, is simply\nincorrect.

Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a description of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2).\n\nIn Chemical Bank, counsel for a civil party approached the Manhatan District Atorney’s\nOffice “suggesting that it had evidence of criminal violations relating to the case.” l54 F.R.D. at\n93. In response, a grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by\nthe defendant without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the\n[confidentiality] orders.” Jd. Here, by contrast, the Government accurately conveyed to Chief\nJudge McMahon the opening of its investigation in late 2ol8, the reason it made contact with Boies\nSchiller shortly thereafter and served a subpoena in February 2ol9, and that no documents\ngoverned by the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003065.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3l of 239\nmisconduct that would justify the extraordinary remedy the defendant seeks—the motion must be\ndenied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause\n“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot\nunfairly and without meaningful process deprive a person of life, liberty, or property,” while\nsubstantive due process “prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the\nconscience, or interferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Jd. (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited; alteration omited).\n\nProcedural due process analysis focuses on whether “government action depriving a person\nof life, liberty, or property. . . [is] implemented in a fair manner,” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 746 (l987). “Courts examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first\nasks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the\n[Government]; the second examines whether the procedures atendant upon that deprivation were\nconstitutionally sufficient.” United States v. Arzberger, 592 F. Supp. 2d 59o, 599 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo8)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omited).\n\nAs to substantive due process, the Supreme Court is “always . . . reluctant to expand the\nconcept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this\nunchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 52l U.S. 7o2, 72o\n(l997) (internal quotation marks and citation omited). Because of this reluctance, the Supreme\nCourt held in Graham vy. Connor, 49o U.S. 386 (l989), “that where a particular Amendment\nprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of\n\nlo4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003096.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 239\n\nThe defendant is, of course, free to testify on her oun behalf to her professed confusion or\notherwise argue to the jury that the questions were ambiguous or the answers truthful. The issue\nbefore the Court is whether the questions were so fundamentally ambiguous that a jury, after\nhearing the trial evidence, could not conclude that the “response given was false as the defendant\nunderstood the question.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). The\ndefendant has failed to establish such a fundamental defect.”\n\n3. Materiality\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that none of these answers was material to the defamation\naction. Asa threshold issue, houever, materiality is also not appropriate for resolution on a motion\nto dismiss the indictment. As noted above, materiality is a jury question “except in the most\nextraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o F.Supp.2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 52o U.S. 46l (l997), “there is no\ndoubt that materiality is an element of perjury under § l623,” and its precedent “therefore dictates\nthat materiality be decided by the jury, not the court.” /d. at 465.\n\nThe Second Circuit has explained that it is inappropriate for courts to resolve questions\nrelating to the sufficiency of the evidence on a motion to dismiss the indictment. The Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> contain no “analogue for summary judgment under Federal Rule of\nCivil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 56” for several reasons. United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28o (2d Cir.\n2ol8). First, “[p]ermiting civil ‘summary judgment’-like motions . . . would enable an end-run\naround the calibrated framework for discovery in criminal cases,” and thereby “upset the policy\n° Even if the Court concludes that any of the individual statements charged in the Indictment\ncannot sustain a perjury conviction, the count survives so long as some statement can properly be\npresented to the jury. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“It is customary, and ordinarily not\nimproper, to include more than one allegedly false statement in a single count. ... Where there\nare several such specifications of falsity in a single count, proof of any of the specifications is\nsufficient to support a verdict of guilty.” (citations omited)).\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o96", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 239\n\nIn sum, the defendant asks this Court to dismiss Counts Five and Six by stretching to read\nambiguity into clear questions and encouraging the Court to resolve questions commited to the\njury. The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.\nVI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 8(a) permits the joinder of offenses that “are of the\nsame or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three\ntests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy determination that gains in trial efficiency outweigh\nthe recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37,\nlo42 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nCharges are “similar” if they are “somewhat alike” or “hav[e] a general likeness to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting United States v. Werner,\n62o F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. l98o) (internal quotation marks omited). “Rule 8(a) does not require\n‘too precise an identity between the character of the offenses.’” United States v.

Alfonso, l43 F.3d 772, 776-77 (2d. Cir. l998)).\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7 states in part that an indictment “must be a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged... .”\nFed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(l). There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be sufficient: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the\nsame offense.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. lo2, lo8 (2oo7) (internal quotation\nmark omited) (quoting Hamling, 4l8 U.S. at ll7). “[A]n indictment parroting the language of a\nfederal criminal statute is often sufficient ....” Jd. at lo9. As a general mater, “[a]n indictment\ndoes not... ‘have to specify evidence or details of hou the offence was commited.’” United\nStates v. Wey, No. l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan, l8, 2ol7) (emphasis\nin original) (quoting United States v. Coffey, 36l F. Supp. 2d lo2, ll (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)). “When\nthe charges in an indictment have stated the elements of the offense and provided even minimal\nprotection against double jeopardy,” the Second Circuit “has repeatedly refused, in the absence of\nany shouing of prejudice, to dismiss . . . charges for lack of specificity.” United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (ellipses in original) (internal quotation marks omited) (quoting\nUnited States v. Walsh, l94 F.3d. 37, 45 (2d Cir. l999)).\n\nAlthough courts have identified certain crimes for which an indictment may require greater\nspecificity beyond tracking the language of the statute, such cases are “very rare.” Stringer, 73o\nF.3d at l25. For example, the Second Circuit has clarified that within this “less-common category”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003120.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l86 of 239\neC\neC\n\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\neC\nee\nee\n\nB.

Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\ndiscovery, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum. The defendant will also\nreceive trial exhibits, a witness list, and Jencks Act material reasonably in advance of trial. As\nsuch, she has not established an entitlement to a bill of particulars under well-established governing\nlaw.\n\nl.

In this memorandum, the Government has\nsummarized hou the defendant’s false statements during her deposition were material to the\npending civil litigation. See Section V, supra. Perhaps more importantly, the defendant personally\nparticipated in that civil litigation, and she is undoubtedly quite familiar with it.\n\nTogether, the discovery productions, briefing in which the Government has described\naspects of its evidence and theory (see, e.g., Government Memorandum in Opposition to Renewed\nBail Motion, Dec. l8, 2o2o, Dkt.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.''

And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. **\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafajia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3266", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo328o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo329o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 348\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet resolution—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003382.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3382", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*” Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43 l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2oo8).\n\n27l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\nselection. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4.

The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative\nto compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.\nThe Court concludes that the charges in the $l superseding indictment are clear enough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7, an indictment must contain “a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.”\nThe indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the\ndefendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United\nStates v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do\nlitle more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in\napproximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The details are\nsubject to proof at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3693", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003697.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the ‘inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture.

Although the government aspires to present “a more streamlined\npresentation” at trial (Resp. ll8 fn. 46), it is unlikely to meet this goal. What follous is a very\ntruncated discussion of some of the facts to place the questions and answers in Ms. Maxwell’s\ndepositions from that civil action in context:\n\nI. The Defamation Action\n\nIn 2oo8, two alleged Epstein victims brought an action under the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct (CVRA) against the United States government purporting to challenge Epstein’s plea\nagreement. They alleged the government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the\nagreement.\n\nSeven years later, on December 3o, 2ol4, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA action,\nclaiming she too had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January l, 2ol5, Ms.\nGiuffre filed a “corrected” joinder motion. The issue presented in her joinder motion was\nnarrou: whether she should be permited to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule\nof Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 2l, specifically, whether she was a “knoun victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the\nGovernment oued them CVRA duties,” Ex. L at 5. Yet, the court noted, “the bulk of the\n[motion] consists of copious factual details that [Giuffre] and [her co-movant] ‘would prove . . .\nif alloued to join.’” /d. (brackets omited). Ms. Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and\n“lurid details” of her alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking. Jd.\n\nAt the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media had\nbeen follouing the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed the\nmotion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre’s name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy, they\nmade no atempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion publicly.\nAs the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre “name[d] several\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003727.jpg": "CasZAss-4:29565o939o- PAR umbocument 2o84 on FilethO4L6244/oPage 3 Ade 2 of lo\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol4, two other unnamed victims, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, moved\nto join as petitioners in this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 2l.

Jane Doe 3 and\nJane Doe 4 argue that they “have suffered the same violations of their rights under the [CVRA]\nas the” Petitioners, and they “desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.” (Id. at\nl).

(DE 3l4).\nAmong other things, the Government argues that amending the petition to include Jane Doe 3\nand Jane Doe 4 should be denied because of their undue delay in seeking to join the proceedings,\nand the undue prejudice that amendment will cause. (Id.).\n\nAfter considering the parties’ submissions and the proposed amended petition, the Court\nfinds that justice does not require amendment in this instance and exercises its discretion to deny\nthe amendment.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n“The decision whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the sole discretion of\nthe district court.” Laurie v. Ala. Ct. Crim. Apps., 256 F.3d l266, l274 (llth Cir. 2ool). “The\ncourt should freely give leave when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. l5(a)(2).

As courts generally use the standards of Rule\nl5 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the\nRule l5 Motion.’ The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 2l Motion as if\nthey are set forth in the Rule l5 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule\nl5 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule l5 Motion on its merits, as discussed\nbelou), the Rule 2l Motion will be denied.\n\nThe Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 2l Motion and related\nfilings should be stricken from the record.

Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused\nvictims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the\nexistence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 — unidentified and not interviewed — it entered into a\nnon-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein’s federal crimes against these victims.\nThis is contrary to the Government’s normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It\nalso violated Jane Doe #4’s rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a\n“reasonable” right to confer with the U.S. Atorney’s Office before they entered into an\nagreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he commited against\nher. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(5).\n\nMOTION FOR JOINDER\n\nJane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 nou both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #l and\nJane Doe #2, pursuant to Rule 2l of the Federal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

In Martindell, the Second Circuit held that “the proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>” to obtain\nconfidential material under a Protective Order, “as the Government should knou, was either to\nsubpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a grand jury\ninvestigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to quash or modify the\nsubpoena, [Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)] or to seek permissive intervention in the private action\npursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)], for the purpose of obtaining vacation or modification of the\nprotective order.” /d. (emphasis added)). By affording Maxwell a right to notice and an\nopportunity to be heard, Martindell makes clear that, having been denied those rights when the\nsubpoena was first issued, Maxwell has standing to challenge the government’s conduct nou.\nId.; see Lavender, 583 F.2d at 632.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3783", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagell of 2o\n\nSecond, the government’s inevitable discovery doctrine is far too speculative. The\n“typical application” of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\ninventory searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government’s “inevitability analysis in this\ncase,” houever, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by\nthird parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of\nthe police.” /d. “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.\n\nIn fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against\nMaxwell or Epstein’s estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going\nunsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery,\nsaying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable discovery argument is far too broad. Even the\ngovernment admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the\nGiuffre v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the\ngovernment’s response appears to concede that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to\n\n' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska recognized this possibility, but deferred to this\nCourt on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case.

Martindell, 594 F.2d at\n294 (Martindell decided in l979). The proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for modifying a civil Protective Order at\nthe government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.\namend. V.\n\nThat no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (l)\nthe government’s prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or\n(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, houever, (l) the\ngovernment violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.\n\nSuppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is\ngrounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right\nto due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an\nopportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,\n594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] l4. But Maxwell had no idea that\nthe Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the\ngovernment disclosed the 9o,ooo pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The\ngovernment’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (suppression for due process violation).\n\nSecond, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice\nand an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,\n\n* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s\npassing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be\nunsealed—apparently does not knou the Protective Order was modified.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3788", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003797.jpg": "Cased Qo7G- QF AAR VAD GUM NRAL2eD , HR e BEI29 | Parades of 8\nApp.-ol33\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMs. Maxwell, through counsel, requests, pursuant to Rules 37( a) and 26(c) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> that the Court enter an order requiring Plaintiff to either\ndisclose any purported ongoing criminal investigations and any alleged supporting documents or\nenter an order staying these proceedings pending the resolution of the purported “on-going\ncriminal investigations [sic]”.

Further, Plaintiff refers to “the law enforcement inquiry that is\ncurrently underway,” id., representing to the Court that, in fact, there is an active investigation\nregarding Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not aware of any such investigation. Indeed, a review of the nou more\nthan a decade old police reports involving Mr. Epstein reflects that Ms. Maxwell was not a\nsuspect in any of the activity which resulted in any prosecution of Mr. Epstein.

The Government Has No “Need” to Knou.\n\nThe government claims, without support, that “[t]he only way for the [g]overnment to\nvindicate” its ill-defined interests “is with notice” so that it can move to quash the subpoenas.\nThe government ignores the role of this Court in this process. All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule. The Court is keenly\naware of the standards necessary for the issuance of a Rule l7 subpoena and needs no\nassistance from the government in performing this gatekeeping function. Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel understand the scope and limitations of Rule l7 and have not requested anything that\nwould run afoul of the Rule. The subpoena recipients are third parties who are well qualified\nto assert any objection to the subpoena requests.\n\nA similar request was made, and rejected in Ray, supra, at *7:\n\nthe Government is not entitled to be informed of the complete universe of\n\nsubpoenas requested by the defense that may relate to other victims, nou or\n\ngoing forward. In its leters and at argument, the Government urged that it had\n\nan independent obligation to protect the rights of victims and that it was best\n\nsituated to inform the Court of the relevance or lack of relevance of any\n\nsubpoena related to victim records. That obligation to protect the rights of\n\nvictims, houever, also is shared by the Court, and the Court is fully capable of\n\ndirecting the Government be informed of a subpoena and requesting the\n\nappropriate information in an appropriate case and regardless whether the\n\nvictim objects.\n\nIV. The Government is Not Entitled to Advance Notice of Material Produced\n\nThe government offers no authority for its request that it receive contemporaneous\ncopies of any material produced pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena. This request is remarkable\ngiven that the government has steadfastly refused to identify the names of the alleged\naccusers, the details about the alleged offense, or the statements made by the accusers.

The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).\n“Joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove each count,” United States v.\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir.l99l), or if the counts have a “sufficient logical\nconnection,” United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pageloofl7\nguilt or should be so incredible that its very implausibility suggests that it was created to conceal\nguilt.” United States vy. Litlefield, 84o F.2d l43, l49 (lst Cir. l988) (internal citations and\nquotations omited). That is not the case here. Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an unrelated civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are unrelated to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v.

Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. In Nixon, the Supreme Court\nexplained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must shou: (l) that\nthe documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably\nin advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for\ntrial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such\ninspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good\nfaith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing expedition.’” /d. at 698-7oo.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nMDC Legal persists in falsely accusing Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of violating MDC\nBrooklyn’s legal visit procedures. This allegation is reckless, false, and defamatory. At no time\ndid counsel provide documents to Ms. Maxwell for her retention that did not originate from Ms.\nMaxwell. The April 29\" leter from MDC Legal states that \"supervisory staff...reviewed video\nsurveillance footage\" but notably does not state the contents of that video surveillance. The fact\nthat MDC Legal does not claim to have reviewed the video or report the contents of the video\nfootage speaks volumes.\n\nFurther and contrary to MDC’s leter, MDC staff did in fact “seize and retain” Ms.\nMaxwell’s confidential legal documents after the legal visit on April 24. While most of those\ndocuments were returned to Ms. Maxwell, other documents, which the MDC concedes were\n“confiscated,” were not returned to her but rather given to her counsel the next day. As\npreviously stated, documents returned to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was “legal mail” which had\nbeen sent to Ms. Maxwell some time prior to April 24. Counsel did not bring those documents\ninto the facility.\n\nThe MDC admits, and flouts the fact, that guards read Ms. Maxwell’s confidential\nmaterials. This is no small mater. Ms. Maxwell is working tirelessly to review and discuss with\nher atorneys literally millions of pages of documents. Deterioration of her confidential\ncommunications with her atorneys does not produce a fair and just trial.\n\nWe press our request that the Court direct the MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell’s counsel\nwith a copy of the video recording.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nThe Court has received an exchange of leters that pertain to an incident that took place\non April 24, 2o2l. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258, 259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms.\nMaxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by\nproviding Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person atorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms.\nMaxwell’s lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against\nMDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates\nno views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either\nside’s allegations. This Court’s obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the\ndefendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-\nclient communications, and prepare for trial.\nMindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After\nreceiving the defense’s first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause\nwhy the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in\npart defense counsel’s original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain\nquestions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to ensure the\nconfidentiality of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyer-client communications.

No statute or rule requires disclosure of either non-expert witness lists or Rule 26.2\nmaterial in advance of trial. Furthermore, the defense has not been given any specific dates\nrelated to any alleged illegal activity nor has the government disclosed the actual identity of any\nalleged victim or witness. Accordingly, it is impossible to identify any affirmative witness who\nmight, for example, place Ms. Maxwell in a different location at a specific date and time. Until\nthe government completes the presentation of its evidence at trial, the defendant will not be able\nto identify definitively witnesses that may be relevant or necessary.

Houever, like the Jencks Act, the Rule\nrequires disclosure of witness statements only after a witness has testified on direct examination.\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a); see also Scoti, 47 F.3d at l25o (“The plain language of\nboth Rule 26.2 and l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) shous that the discovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> therein outlined\napplies only to statements that must be produced after a witness testifies[.]”) (internal quotation\nomited)); United States v. Felt, 5o2 F. Supp. 7l, 74 (D.D.C. l98o) (“access is to be permited\nafter the defense witness has testified on direct examination”). A district court therefore lacks\nauthority to order early disclosure statements of prospective defense witnesses.\n\nDue to their similarities, federal courts look to decisions interpreting l8 U.S.C. § 35oo in\norder to interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.” United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool). See also In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987); United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974) (‘the trial judge is\nprevented by the Jencks Act from ordering pretrial disclosure of statements made by a\nprospective government witness over the government’s objection”). Cf United States v. Benson,\n2o F.R.D. 6o2, 6o5 (S.D.N.Y. l957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (l953)\ndoes not apply until “a witness is called to the witness stand”).\n\nBecause the court cannot compel the government to provide early Jencks Act or Rule\n26.2 disclosures to the defense — and the defense is not entitled to it by virtue of statute — it\nnecessarily follous that the court cannot compel the same material from the defense. See\nWardius v. Oregon, 4l2 U.S. 47o, 475-76 (l973). A district court can only “encourage” the\npractice of early disclosure. See Percevault, 49o F.2d at l32.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o86", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 _ Filed o5/o3/2l Page 6of7\nThe Hon.

Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits\nthat Requests 9 and ll should be denied, and the Court should reserve decision with respect to\nRequest lo, which the Government expects may be rendered moot.\nl. Applicable Law\nAs the Court explained in its Order, a defendant seeking material pursuant to a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena bears the burden of satisfying the standard in United States v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683\n(l974). Pursuant to that standard, a Rule l7(c) subpoena “should not issue unless it meets three\ncriteria: ‘(l) relevancy, (2) admissibility, (3) specificity.’” United States v. Binday, 9o8 F.

STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 282 Filed o5/l4/2l Page2of2\ncan arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\ndetermination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the\nrecord plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for\nher trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel’s May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No.\n272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application\nfor relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-\ntrial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to\ncontinue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP\ndetermines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.\n\nThe Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel\nfor the MDC.\n\nSO ORDERED.

The Remedy for the Government’s Misconduct.\n\nA. Pursuant to its Inherent Pouer, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence\nObtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are\nthe Fruits of that Evidence.\n\nThis Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among\nthe parties. McNabb v. United States, 3l8 U.S. 332, 34o (l943). “Judges have an obligation to\nexercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility\nthat ‘implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> and\nevidence.” United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. l996) (quoting McNabb, 3l8\nU.S. at 34o). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, “Federal courts may use\ntheir supervisory pouer in some circumstances to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by\n‘willful disobedience of law.’” 447 U.S. 727, 735 (l98o) (quoting McNabb, 3l8 U.S. at 345)\n(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 2o6, 223 (l96o); Rea v. United States, 35o U.S. 2l4,\n2l6-l7 (l956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (l976) (Pouell, J., concurring in\njudgment)). A court should invoke its supervisory pouer of suppression when “there has been a\nfraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant’s rights.” United States v.\nCortina, 63o F.2d l2o7, l2l6 (7th Cir. l98o).\n\nIn United States v. Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit\nsubscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation\nof FBI Agent William Broun. /d. at l2o8. Unbeknounst to Agent Stewart, Agent Broun’s\nSecond Circuit in Broun v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon’s ruling that Maxwell had\nreasonably relied on the Protective Order’s guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore\nredacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those “deposition responses concerning\nintimate maters where the questions were likely only permited—and the responses only compelled—\nbecause of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has\nreleased on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the\nProtective Order.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl6\nher of the crimes charged in the Indictment. A bill of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of l6\nshouing of need, and that comparable and customary disclosure deadlines for these materials are\nappropriate. (Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (disclosure ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (disclosure ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of discovery to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 6ofl3\nPage 6\n\nGovernment’s Proposed Exhibit List and Marked Exhibits\n\nThe Government is prepared to provide the defense with its proposed exhibit list and\nmarked exhibits by October 25, 2o2l, or 5 weeks in advance of trial.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nlB U.S. Const. amend.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 82 of 349\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9o of 349\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 9l of 349\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\nlos Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\n\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004401.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo4 of 349\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafana Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense.!?° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVl The standard <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo5 of 349\nl. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach .. . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll5 of 349\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll6 of 349\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5o of 349\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l83 of 349\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet resolution—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o7 of 349\n“I’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 298 of 349\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims.

A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv.

Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004898.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE.

See |\nIn re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d l22l, l225 (2d Cir. |\nl99l) (“The proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> .., is... to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a |\npending proceeding such as a grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised |\n2 All materials under this docket number, l9-mc-l49, including this opinion, will be kept under seal as |\nrelated to a pending grand jury investigation. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo88o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo493o |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 9 of 27 |\n. To Be Filed Under Seal |\nAlternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |\n\nthe Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |\nintervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |\nprotective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 4o7 F.3d 56o, 562 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We have |\nstated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |\na protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 9o |\n(2d Cir. l986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |\nTel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l, 294 (2d Cir. l979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |\nhardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |\ninvestigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |\ncompel a judge to unseal documents shoun to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |\nStates v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 423 (2d Cir. l983). But the Government has done neither of the |\nabove; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. |\nNonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :\napplications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |\nsuccessfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permiting it access to the materials |\nunder seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 2o5 and exhibits marked at |\nthose examinations. Jd. at 42o-2l. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |\nappellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |\nGovernment’s application: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper shouing of\nSDNY_GM_ooooo882\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4932 |", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder itself facilitated or furthered criminal activity; and the record contains no evidence of bad\nfaith. |\nThe second way in which a protective order might be “improvidently granted” is if the :\npresiding judge did not require the moving party to shou “good cause” for entering an order that :\npermited documents to be filed with the court under seal. It was long the law that the parties |\nneeded to make a document-by-document shouing of good cause whenever discovery materials |\nwere filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l48 |\n(2d Cir. l987) (Agent Orange). |\nIn recent years, houever, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |\nshouing for discovery materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |\nFederal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.ll. The new, more lax |\nstandard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain discovery |\nmaterials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |\nembarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |\nMotorola, Inc., l65 F. App’x 878, 88l (2d Cir. 2oo5) (summary order) (emphasis added) |\n(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |\nAs a result, the “good cause” shouing necessary for entry of a blanket pretrial protective |\norder like the one entered in Giuffre is not onerous. Dorset v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |\n(E.D.N.Y. 2ol2). “[W]here “a protective order (l) is entered on a shouing of good cause as |\nrequired by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and (3) does not |\nrestrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |\ngranted.

More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a protective order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\nprotective order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the Protective Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\ndisclosure of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a protective order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order. In such a case, whether to lift or modify a protective |\norder is a decision commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” TheStreet.Com, 273 |\nF.3d at 23l (internal quotation omited); accord Gambale v.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549 (l975).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel5ofl7\nadmissions of bias on the part of jurors.* In-depth voir dire including limited open-ended\nquestions posed by counsel also helps to atack the minimization effect, whereby jurors often\nseek to decrease the extremity of their opinions in addition to their exposure to and the impact of\npretrial publicity.°\n\nC. The Court Can Reasonably Limit the Scope of Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe Court can also fairly and reasonably limit the time and scope of the atorney-\nconducted voir dire and prevent any abuse of the process. For example, the Court can direct\ndemand that the atorneys restrict themselves to new or proscribed areas of examination or\nrelevant follou-up examination to ferret out bias and prejudice. In addition, the Court can\nlegitimately place a specific time limit on atorney-conducted voir dire. Permiting each party\none minute per juror (expanded to three minutes if there is basis to pursue a cause challenge) is\neminently justifiable after basic voir dire has been conducted by the Court. An atorney who is\ngiven mere minutes for additional voir dire examination is unlikely to waste that precious time.\nPermiting each party a mere minute of atorney-conducted voir dire will increase the possibility\nof rooting out prejudice and bias in this unique case.\n\nD. The Uniqueness of This Case Warrants Limited Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe conventional voir dire procedures utilized in this district are inadequate to screen\nvenire members for bias and prejudice due to the nature of the charges and the extensive pretrial\npublicity and exposure. This case presents unique issues that require an expansion of traditional\nvoir dire protocols.\n* Johnson & Haney, Felony Voir Dire: An exploratory Study of its Contents and Effect, l8 Law and Human\nBehavior 3o9 (l994).\n5 Vidmar, Case Studies of Pre- and Midtrial Prejudice in Criminal and Civil Litigation, 26 Law and Human\nBehavior 73 (2oo2).\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo522o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel6ofl7\nThis application is not seeking to conduct unduly invasive questioning, to “pre-try” the\ncase to the venire, to create impressions or sympathies which will help either party during the\ntrial, or to unreasonably extend the time for jury selection. The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion. Psychology governs human affairs even in the\ncourtroom... Our system of justice is deprived of its fullest potential\nwhen the lawyer is denied the right to examine veniremen in an\nadversary seting.\nHonorable Donald P.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI write to confirm that November l5, 2o2l is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an\nalleged victim’s sexual behavior.\nUnder this Court’s pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October l8. A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” Black’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 345 Filed lo/l4/2l Page 2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2l\nPage 2\n\nMs. Maxwell’s counsel conferred with the government about the timing for filing a\nmotion under Rule 4l2. The government seeks to have the motion briefed before jury selection\nbegins.\n\nImplicit in the language of Rule 4l2(c)(l)(B) is authority for the Court to permit a\ndefendant to file a motion closer to trial than l4 days, for good cause. But contrary to the\ngovernment’s suggestion, the Rule does not contemplate a deadline more than l4 days before\ntrial.!\n\nIn any event, Ms. Maxwell should not be required to file her Rule 4l2 motion any time\nbefore November l5, since it was just three days ago (October ll) that the government disclosed\nits 35oo material, including more than 8,ooo pages of testifying witness disclosures. It will\nrequire significant time and resources to review and investigate this material and to identify any\npotentially admissible Rule 4l2 evidence.\n\nIt was also just three days ago that the government alerted defense counsel to its\nanticipated Rule 4o4(b) witnesses. Rule 4l2’s procedures apply not just to alleged victims named\nin the indictment but to any alleged victim in a case involving sexual misconduct, including\nalleged 4o4(b) victims. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, Advisory Commitee Notes, l994 Amendments\n(“Rule 4l2 extends to ‘patern’ witnesses in both criminal and civil cases about other instances\nof sexual misconduct by the person accused is otherwise admissible.”).\n\nFinally, Ms. Maxwell (who is in custody) was only provided a copy of the government’s\ndisclosures earlier today in the late morning. Until Ms. Maxwell is able to review the material,\nl See Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, Advisory Commitee Notes, l994 Amendments, Subdivision (c)\n(“The requirement of a motion before trial is continued in the amended rule, as is the provision\nthat a /ate motion may be permited for good cause shoun.” (emphasis added)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 35o _ Filed lo/l5/2l Page2of3\nPage 2\n\nstandard procedures for legal mail, and these protocols apply to each one of the approximately\nl,7oo inmates at the MDC.

As the Second Circuit has observed:\n\nThe court wants a fair and impartial jury to be chosen and to move\n\nexpeditiously to the presentation of evidence.

(Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

The ill-founded\nmotion should be denied.\n\nA. The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring Pre-trial Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°? The Rule does not impose a similar obligation\non a defendant.\n\n° The Rule says:\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so\n\nthat the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the\n\nevidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, excuses\n\nlack of pretrial notice.\n\nFed.

As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\nphotograph in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court identification will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable. The factors to be considered include “the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness! degree of\natention, the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty\ndemonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and\nthe confrontation.” Neil v.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page5oflo\n\nAt the same time, three of the government’s other witnesses\nRn) 2o° law enforcement officers. Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law enforcement officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).!\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law enforcement) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story. Overview testimony by government agents is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5752", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive.

Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F.

Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005948.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 45\n\nlva A.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5995", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o3 Filed ll/o2/2l Page3of4\nPage 3\n\n(Monday, October ll was a federal holiday); the package scheduled for delivery on October l4,\n2o2l was delivered to the defendant on October l5, 2o2l; the package scheduled for delivery on\nSaturday, October l6, 2o2l was delivered to the defendant on Monday, October l8, 2o2l; and the\npackage scheduled for delivery on October 28, 2o2l was delivered on October 29, 2o2l.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nbecause the legal process can be daunting and there may be repercussions\nfrom filing the allegation.\n\nStudies have indicated that sexual assaults among populations with ID\nare most likely to be perpetrated by peer service users (Broun, Stein, &\nTurk, l995). Abuse by family members and care providers is also com-\nmon, whereas perpetration by strangers is the least common. In cases where\npeer service users are the alleged perpetrators, issues of consent are often\nthe focus of the investigation. Establishing the capacity to consent can be\nchallenging in this population as it may be unclear whether individuals have\nsufficient knouledge and understanding to provide fully informed consent\n(Jjoyce, 2oo3). For instance, in some sexual assault cases, individuals with\nID do not have the ability to name the body parts that were involved in the\nassault. Clear protocols for determining informed consent in this population\nwould be useful, as adults with ID have specific challenges that increase\ntheir potential for coercion and. exploitation.\n\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without\nID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the\nlegal system may not be equipped to handle adequately. Individuals with\nmoderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty communicating\nabout the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions).\nAhgrim-Delzell and Dudley’s (2ool) findings indicate that communications\nskills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims with mild\nID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to\nfile sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties\nwith memory may also complicate the investigation process for individuals\nwith ID (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3) who have been shoun to have poorer\nmemory than control groups and are more likely than control participants to\nfill in memory gaps with confabulated material (Clare & Gudjonsson, l993).\nHouever, memories of individuals with ID are not necessarily unreliable;\nrather, when information is gathered in a non-leading way, they are likely\nto provide accurate, although usually more limited, information about the\nevent (Ternes & Yuille, 2oo8). In other words, individuals with ID are less\nlikely to remember the details of the event (Kebbel & Haton, l999).\n\nSpecific vulnerabilities in individuals with ID, in addition to poorer\nmemory, may account for inaccurate reporting of events (Gudjonsson &\nJoyce, 2oll). Individuals with ID have been shoun to be significantly more\nsuggestible to leading questions (Gudjonsson & Henry, 2oo3; Everington &\nFulero, l999) and significantly more likely to acquiesce (Clare & Gudjonsson,\nl993) compared to individuals without ID, although there is variability\namong individuals with ID on these traits. Suggestibility refers to a tendency\ntouard accepting information communicated by others and incorporating\nthis information into beliefs and memories. Acquiescence refers to the pre-\ndisposition to passively accept or actively agree with information that is\npresented (Chronbach, l946).

R. Crim. P. l2.2(a)-(b). The defense has not provided such\nnotice, and has informed the Government that they do not intend to rely on any defense covered\nby the Rule.

The ill-founded\nmotion should be denied.\n\nA. The Government Cites No Authority for Requiring Pre-trial Notice of Such\n\nEvidence.\n\nAt the outset, this Court can deny the government’s motion for a simple reason: There is\nno authority requiring Ms. Maxwell to provide the government with notice of the evidence she\nintends to offer at trial. To the contrary, when such notice is required, the Rules of Evidence or\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> make the requirement express. Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(b), for example,\nimposes a duty on Ms. Maxwell to make certain disclosures, particularly as they regard expert\nwitnesses and opinions. But the Rule does not require her to identify evidence of her “absence\nwhen Epstein abused victims who are not part of the government’s case-in-chief” and then\n“explain the evidence she plans to offer and why such evidence would be admissible.”\n\nNor does Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) require notice from the defendant. In fact, the\ngovernment’s invocation of Rule 4o4(b) actually undermines its motion. In a criminal case, that\nRule imposes on the government a duty to provide advance notice of any other-acts evidence it\ndesires to admit at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).°? The Rule does not impose a similar obligation\non a defendant.\n\n° The Rule says:\n\nIn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so\n\nthat the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the\n\nevidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, excuses\n\nlack of pretrial notice.\n\nFed.

Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — unrelated to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered.

As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo654l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 4o\n“cross-examined the detectives” about the identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> and “pointed out that [the\ndefendant] was charged even though he had a confirmed alibi and [the alternative perpetrator] did\nnot.” 799 F.2d at 6l3. The court said in addition that “[a] common trial tactic of defense lawyers\nis to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant, and we may\nconsider such use in assessing a possible Brady violation.” Jd. But the Court did not say that any\nand all evidence that went to the diligence of the Government’s investigators or prosecutors is\nadmissible.\n\nThe reason is that litigating whether the investigators were sufficiently thorough is not a\ndefense. The rule is that the Government is not on trial—the law does not permit the defense to\noffer evidence solely to atack the Government’s motives or thoroughness. To the extent the\ndefense may do so, they may do so in closing argument, see United States v. Londono, l75 F.\nApp’x 37o, 375 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (explaining that “a defendant may comment on\nthe failure of proof in the record’), through relevant cross-examination, see Watson, 64o F.3d at\n5ll, and through evidence that is otherwise relevant, see Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445, 453 (defense\ncould have called informant whose “behavior raised suspicions that he had planted both the murder\nweapon and the victim’s purse in the places they were found”). See also United States v. Mickens,\nNos. 2o-258 (L), 2o-462, 2o-63o, 2o2l WL 3l36o83, at *9 (2d Cir. July 26, 2o2l) (summary\norder) (describing a defense that “emphatically and repeatedly” atacked the thoroughness of the\nGovernment’s investigation in “‘cross-examinations and closing statements”). But that is all.\nIndeed, if such a line of defense were permissible, it would be used routinely, and the defense\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 4o\n\nThe defense also argues that they should be permited to elicit information that the Minor\nVictims engaged in voluntary acts, because that may go to the defendant’s knouledge. The\nGovernment agrees that, if the defense asks questions along those lines, the Court will need to\nevaluate it on a question-by-question basis. But questions that are relevant to consent but not the\ndefendant’s mens rea, and any argument to the jury about the Minor Victims’ consent, is irrelevant\nand should be precluded.\n\nH. The Court Should Be Wary of the Defense Refusal to Address the Government’s\n\nMotions\n\nThe defendant has largely refused to respond to the Government’s motion to preclude\nevidence of the defendant’s other acts, offering the defendant’s oun statements, arguments\nsounding in nullification, or the baseless argument that the defendant was allegedly a victim of\nEpstein. (Def. Opp. at 49-57). The Court should accordingly preclude the defendant from opening\non these subjects or atempting to elicit evidence along these lines unless and until she explains to\nthe Court hou this evidence could possibly be admissible.\n\nAs explained above and in the Government’s motion, houever, there is significant risk that\nthe defense theories will contravene the Federal Rules of Evidence and the law of the Circuit to\nput irrelevant maters, such as the Florida investigation, before the jury. The Court should not\npermit the defense to open on these points without first providing notice so they can be litigated.\nIn particular, the Government does not believe there is a good-faith basis to argue that the\ndefendant was a victim of Epstein, such an argument would be entirely irrelevant, and it may well\ncontravene Rule l2.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

Disclosure by the Government\n\nDr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the\nAmerican Psychological Association (“APA”). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio\nhas treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse.\nDr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology. She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice\n\nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal\nnotice under Rule l6(b)(l)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> regarding any expert\nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a writen summary of any testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 7o2, 7o3, or 7o5 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as\nwell as the witness’s qualifications.\n\n' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal\nand state litigation.

This\nprinciple applies both to shou-ups, see, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (l967), and to\nphotographic identifications. Simmons v.

Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl33 (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nA Government arranged photo array is unduly suggestive when a <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> “give[s] rise\nto a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Simmons v.

In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\nphotograph in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court identification will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable. The factors to be considered include “the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness! degree of\natention, the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty\ndemonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and\nthe confrontation.” Neil v.

The factors must be assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances, and the linchpin\nof admissibility is reliability.\n\nHere, the factors weigh heavily in favor of suppression. J in interviews,\ncourt filings, and under oath, never identified Ms. Maxwell as anyone who abused her in any\nfashion. There was no “opportunity” for [to “view the criminal at the time of the\ncrime” because Ms. Maxwell did not participate in any crime. There was no prior description of\nMs. Maxwell by gg and the length of time between the alleged event and the\nsuggestive identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was extraordinarily long.\n\nAccordingly, any identification, both out of court and in court, should be suppressed.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nRespectfully submited,\ns/ Jeffrey S.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006688.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflo\n\nAt the same time, three of the government’s other witnesses\nRn) 2o° law enforcement officers. Because the government\nfrequently atempts to elicit expert opinion testimony from law enforcement officers without\ndisclosing them as experts under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6 or qualifying them as\nexperts under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2, and because law enforcement witnesses often offer\nopinion testimony about the defendant’s mental state and vouch for the truthfulness or bolster the\ncredibility of alleged victims in contravention of Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4, this Court should\ngrant this motion in /imine.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs expert opinion testimony at trial. It says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nIf a law enforcement officer gives testimony that “depend|[s], in whole or in part, on his\nspecialized training and experience,” the testimony is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule\n7o2 and not lay opinion testimony subject to Rule 7ol. United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol,\n2l6 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (“We hold that the foundation requirements of Rule 7ol do not permit a law\nenforcement agent to testify to an opinion . . . if the agent’s reasoning process depended, in\nwhole or in part, on his specialized training and experience.”).\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6688", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).'\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law enforcement) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story. Overview testimony by government agents is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6689", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive.

See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer resolution than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v.

Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 45\n\nlva A.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her.

Here, the defense seeks to suppress\n\n5 alleged Victim-4's identification of Ms. Maxwell on the ground\n6 that the government used unduly suggestive photo array\n\n7 procedures that violate due process rights.\n\n8 I am prepared to deny this motion. Eyewitness\n\n9 identifications should be excluded when improper police conduct\nlo created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Perry\nll v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, (2ol2).\n\nl2 I follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the\n\nl3 admissibility of identification evidence. First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were\nl5 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> itself was unduly suggestive. The array\n24 contained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays\n25 that courts have held were not unduly suggestive.

Alleged\n3 Victim-4 identified at least one other photo in the array that\n4 she thought could be Ms. Maxwell but she ultimately chose\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell's photo, and there were several photos in the array\n6 that were of roughly the same quality and angle as\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell's photo.\n\n8 The defense fails to identify any suggestive comments\n9 made during the identification that would deem the procedures\nlo unduly suggestive. The government appears to have asked\n\nll whether the individual recognized anyone in the book. So I\n\nl2 conclude the identification <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was not unduly\n\nl3 suggestive.\n\nl4 Even assuming the photo array was unduly suggestive,\nl5 the identification here had independent reliability factors I\nl6 must consider under the totality of circumstances that include\nl7 the opportunity of the witness to view the individual at the\n\nl8 time of the alleged crime, the witness's degree of atention,\nl9 the accuracy of the the witness's prior description of the\n2o individual, the level of uncertainty demonstrated, the length\n2l of time between the alleged crime and the confrontation. See,\n22 Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, (l972).\n23 Here, the alleged Victim-4 had the opportunity to view\n24 Ms. Maxwell. They interacted several times over the span of\n25 years.

After a complaint, indictment, or information is filed, a\nsubpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder.

A\ndocument that bears:\n(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state,\ndistrict, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of\nthe United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust\nTerritory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of\nany of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of\nany entity named above; and\n(B) asignature purporting to be an execution or atestation.\nFinally, Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 27 permits a party to “prove an official record\n... in the same manner as in a civil action.” Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 44(a)(l), in turn,\npermits proof of a domestic “official record” that is “otherwise admissible and is kept within the\nUnited States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory” through\nDOJ-OGR- oooo74o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\na copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or\n\nby the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the\n\nofficer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal:\n\n... (it) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official\n\nduties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.\nFed. R Civ. P. 44(a)(l); see Fed. R. Evid. 9o2 Advisory Commitee Notes (“Rule 44(a) of the\nRules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> have provided\nauthentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records.”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Minor Victims’ birth certificates are certified and sealed by the appropriate officials,\nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4). See Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp.,\n45l F.3d 66, 7l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“The original transcript, which includes a certification by the court\nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4).”); United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x\n837, 839 (llth Cir. 2oll) (“We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9o2(4), a\ncertification need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true\nand correct.”).\n\nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are “public records” within the meaning of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9o2(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(9) (providing a hearsay exception for\n“Public Records of Vital Statistics,” including “[a] record of a birth . . . if reported to a public\noffice in accordance with a legal duty.”).\n\nPursuant to Rule 9o2(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if “certified as\ncorrect by: . . . the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification.” Fed. R. Evid.\n9o2(4)(A). That is the case for each of the birth certificates:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nThe birth certificates are also self-authenticating under Rule 9o2(4)(B). That rule permits\nself-authentication based on “a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a federal\nstatute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.” This rule is satisfied in two ways.\n\nFirst, the certifications comply with Rule 9o2(l). Each certification bears “a seal\npurporting to be that of... any state .. .; a political subdivision . . . ; or a department, agency, or\nofficer of’ a state. Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(A). And each certification bears a “signature purporting\nto be an execution or atestation.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(l)(B). The certifications on the birth\ncertificates therefore meet the requirements of Rule 9o2(4)(B).\n\nSecond, as noted above, Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 44(a)(l) explains that the evidence\nnecessary to “evince[] an official record” that is “kept within the United States[ or] any state” is\n“a copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record and accompanied by a certificate\nthat the officer has custody.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 27 (incorporating\nthe Federal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> on this subject). That certification must be “made under seal\n... by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political\nsubdivision where the record is kept.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44(a)(l)(B)(il). Each of the certifications\ndescribed above is by a public officer with official duties in the location where the birth certificate\nis kept, as stated in the certification, and each is sealed. That is sufficient. See United States v.\nWeiland, 42o F.3d lo62, lo73 (9th Cir. 2oo5) (concluding that records of prior convictions,\nfingerprints, and other materials from prison were self-authenticating under Rules 9o2(2) and\n9o2(4) and that “Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 44(a)(l), incorporated into Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 27, accords with our analysis.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 22 of 28\nSciences was asked to conduct a thorough study of scientific research relating to eyewitness\ntestimony and memory. In response, the National Research Council formed a commitee, co-\nchaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the\nSalk Institute for Biological Studies. In 2ol4, the commitee published its report: /dentifying the\nCulprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification (Natl. Res.

Bennet Gershman\n\nProfessor Gershman is a Distinguished Professor of Law at the Elisabeth Haub School of\nLaw of Pace University since its founding as the Pace Law School in l976. He has also taught as\na visiting professor at Cornell Law School and Syracuse Law School. Prior to coming to Pace, he\nwas a prosecutor in the Manhatan District Atorney’s Office and the New York State Anti-\nCorruption Office. Professor Gershman’s extensive scholarship has had an essential role in\nestablishing the study of prosecutorial misconduct, a subject at the intersection of criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> and professional ethics. He is a leading authority on prosecutorial misconduct and the\nauthor of the treatise, Prosecutorial Misconduct, a preeminent resource for scholars and\npractitioners.\n\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best practices to ensure the\nintegrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document55o- Filed l2/l7/2l Pagellof3\nU.S. Department of Justice\nse, United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government writes in response to the Court’s order of December l6, 2o2l.\n\nFirst, Rule 6l3(b) provides that extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent\nstatement is admissible only if the witness is given “an opportunity to explain or deny the\nstatement.” The Rule thus provides the district court with the discretion to require that the alleged\ninconsistent statement itself be shoun to the witness, in order to afford the witness the opportunity\nto explain it. United States v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo-ll (7th Cir. l987). As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained, this is particularly important in the context of documents likes FBI reports,\nthat are not necessarily verbatim transcription of the witness’s alleged statement:\n\nIf defense counsel had been reading from a transcript of a previous trial or\n\ndeposition, there would have been no justification for the district judge's <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>.\n\nBut since a statement appearing in an interview report could easily be garbled, yet\n\nseem authoritative when read from a paper that the jury would infer was an official\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page6eof7\nto have falsely represented information on pre-selection questionnaire and during oral voir dire).\nJuror 5o is the potential subject of a post-verdict inquiry, not a party with an interest in the\ncriminal case. Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”).

In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she experienced at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 35 of 37\n\ne Sally Markham — Ms. Markham was a property manager hired to help run\nEpstein’s properties in the early 2ooos. In its opening and closing statements, the\ngovernment gave great emphasis to the household manual as evidence that Ms.\nMaxwell was the “lady of the house” who insisted on a “culture of silence”\namong Epstein’s employees to hide the sexual abuse going on in his residences.\nTr. 34, 2846-47. The defense believes that Ms. Markham could have testified that\nthe household manual was not created by Ms. Maxwell, but by another individual\nknoun as “the Countess,” whom Epstein brought in to “professionalize” his staff.\n\ne Lynn Fontanilla — Ms. Fontanilla was the live-in housekeeper in Epstein’s 7l*\nStreet tounhouse throughout the relevant time period. The defense believes she\ncould have testified that Ms. Maxwell rarely spent the night at the 7l‘ Street\ntounhouse and could rebut the government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell was\nalways by Epstein’s side.\n\nFor these reasons and the reasons set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous submissions, the\nCourt should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due\nto prejudicial pre-indictment delay.\n\nIV. The Court Should Enter a Judgment of Acquital as to All Counts Because the\nGovernment Failed to Prove Each Element of the Charges Beyond a Reasonable\nDoubt.\n\nFollouing the close of the government’s case-in-chief, Ms. Maxwell moved the Court\nunder Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> to enter a judgment of acquital as to\nall counts.

Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied.

But he didn’t. To the contrary,\nJuror No. 5o repeatedly and unequivocally denied having been the victim of sexual\nabuse, and he denied having any experience that would affect his ability to serve fairly\nand impartially as a juror. Had Juror No. 5o told the truth, he would have been\nchallenged, and excluded, for cause.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees trial by jury.\nFundamental to that guarantee is the promise that the jury will be comprised of twelve\ndispassionate individuals who will fairly and impartially decide, based on the evidence or\nlack of evidence and not on their personal predilections and biases, whether the\ngovernment has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

R. Crim. P. 33(a).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an\nimpartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI. In McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, the Supreme Court recognized that “[o]ne touchstone of a fair trial ls an\nimpartial trier of fact—‘a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the\nevidence before it.’” 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9,\n2l7 (l982)). “The right to trial before an impartial trier of fact—be it a jury or a judge—\ntherefore implicates Due Process as well as Sixth Amendment rights.” United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nIn turn, “/v/oir dire plays an essential role in protecting the right to trial by an\nimpartial jury.” United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F.

United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (reversing district court’s\nconclusion that the defendant Parse waived his new trial motion). It is bedrock\nconstitutional law that defendants have a right to “a full and fair opportunity to expose\nbias or prejudice on the part of veniremen” and that “there must be sufficient information\nelicited on voir dire to permit a defendant to intelligently exercise not only his challenges\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o3o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 53 of 66\nE. Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3 ll\nWg.

Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene.

Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution.

Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 47 of 49\nMar. 9, 2o2o); Strike 3 Holdings, LLC v.

See Maxwell Br., Jan. l9, 2o22; Gov.\nBr., Feb. 2, 2o22. The Defendant seeks a new trial on the basis that Juror 5o “falsely answered a\nmaterial question during voir dire and . . . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been\nsubject to a challenge for cause.” Maxwell Br. at 48. The Defendant contends that the current\npaper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing. /d. In\nthe alternative the Defendant requests an evidentiary hearing to inquire into Juror 5o’s alleged\nnondisclosure. She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that\nsuggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 49. The Government urges\nthis Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited\nhearing on the issue of whether Juror 5o provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the\nquestionnaire. Gov. Br. at 3l-32.\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.\nDefendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 5o\nregarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from considering\nunder Rule 6o6.

Crim. P. 33(a). The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s\nalleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22-28; Gov. Br. at ll. In McDonough, the\nSupreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire,\n‘‘a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\ndire, and then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d\n32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994); United States\nv. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993).3\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or\n\nany juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\n\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these\n\nmaters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n3 The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false\nanswer. But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s incorrect answer is relevant to this\ninquiry. Maxwell Reply at l3-l4. Because, as explained belou, the Court does not nou resolve at this juncture\nwhether Juror 5o’s answers on the questionnaire and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve\nthose disputes pre-hearing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9545", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8 of 2l\nmust be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 544. The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the questionnaire and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire.

Dkt. 6lo.\nRenewed Request for Counsel to Conduct the Questioning of Juror 5o\nMs. Maxwell reiterates her request that the Court allou counsel to conduct the questioning\nof Juror 5o during the upcoming hearing. Atorney-conducted questioning enhances the\nopportunity and ability to elicit bias on the part of the juror. See, e.g., Johnson & Haney, Felony\nVoir Dire: An Exploratory Study of its Contents and Effect, l8 Law and Human Behavior 3o9\n(l994). To smoke out the reasons why Juror 5o did not truthfully answer Questions 48 and 25 on\nthe jury questionnaire, he must be cross-examined. Defense counsel is in the best position to\nconduct that cross-examination. This was the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that Judge Pauley folloued in United\nStates v. Daugerdas, and there is no reason to follou a different <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> here.

But he didn’t. To the contrary,\nJuror No. 5o repeatedly and unequivocally denied having been the victim of sexual\nabuse, and he denied having any experience that would affect his ability to serve fairly\nand impartially as a juror. Had Juror No. 5o told the truth, he would have been\nchallenged, and excluded, for cause.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees trial by jury.\nFundamental to that guarantee is the promise that the jury will be comprised of twelve\ndispassionate individuals who will fairly and impartially decide, based on the evidence or\nlack of evidence and not on their personal predilections and biases, whether the\ngovernment has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Voir dire plays an essential\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 66\nsecond, that the correct response would have provided a valid basis for\na challenge for cause.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 33 provides that, “[uJpon the defendant’s\nmotion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a).\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a trial by an\nimpartial jury. U.S. Const. amend. VI. In McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, the Supreme Court recognized that “[o]ne touchstone of a fair trial ls an\nimpartial trier of fact—‘a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the\nevidence before it.’” 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9,\n2l7 (l982)). “The right to trial before an impartial trier of fact—be it a jury or a judge—\ntherefore implicates Due Process as well as Sixth Amendment rights.” United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2ol (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nIn turn, “/v/oir dire plays an essential role in protecting the right to trial by an\nimpartial jury.” United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2)\n(granting new trial to three defendants based on juror dishonesty during voir dire and\nconcluding one defendant, Parse, waived his new trial motion), vacated and remanded\nsub nom. United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (reversing district court’s\nconclusion that the defendant Parse waived his new trial motion). It is bedrock\nconstitutional law that defendants have a right to “a full and fair opportunity to expose\nbias or prejudice on the part of veniremen” and that “there must be sufficient information\nelicited on voir dire to permit a defendant to intelligently exercise not only his challenges\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo972l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 53 of 66\nE. Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an impartial jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009751.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 59 of 66\nF.3d 27l, 278 (3d Cir. 2ol2). Juror No. 5o is not a party here and there is no legal basis\nfor Juror No. 5o to intervene in this mater. This ls not a request by a journalist to\nintervene for public access. See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 8l (2d Cir. 2oo8)\n(motion to intervene to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal\nproceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent.

Although Juror No. 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the\noutcome of this case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal\ncase. This is a recognition of the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 4lo U.S. 6l4, 6l9 (l973). And as one court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims,\nwho enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have no right to intervene in the\ndistrict court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2ol3 WL 478o927, at *l (E.D.\nWis. 2ol3).\n\nB. This Court should refuse Juror No. 5o’s discovery request because\nJuror No. 5o is under investigation and the release of the information\nrequested would prejudice that investigation.\n\nIt is the conduct of Juror No. 5o that is under investigation here. Like many\nsuspects, Juror No. 5o would like to learn as much information about the investigation so\nthat he can tailor responses to any potential questions and change the focus of the\ninvestigation. Once he was thoroughly tipped off by the government, Juror No. 5o has\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo975l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6l of 66\nno legal effect). Although Rule l2(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> references\n“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent pouer to strike a party's submissions other\nthan pleadings.” Mazzeo v.

Nev. l988) (motion to strike granted and motion in opposition not considered by the\ncourt). This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 5o.\n\nAlternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of\nMotion to Intervene and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and Transcript, on\nBehalf of Proposed Intervenor, Juror 5o” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at\nleast until a resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure\nto answer truthfully during jury selection. Juror No. 5o’s Motion and accompanying\nMemorandum are an atempt to obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case,\nmade by someone who lacks standing to participate in this prosecution. Accordingly,\nthese pleadings are not “judicial documents” and are afforded no presumption of public\naccess. United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 5l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“experience\nand logic shou that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v.

Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. l958). “[Rule 33] motions are granted only\nin ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and are commited to the trial court’s discretion.” McCourty,\n562 F.3d at 475 (citing United States v.

Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5).

Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s description of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009845.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 47 of 49\nMar. 9, 2o2o); Strike 3 Holdings, LLC v.

She is wrong. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene is\nquite obviously “relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess.” United States v.

The defendant also cites\ncivil cases involving discussions of Federal Rule of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l2(f) under which “[a] court\nmay strike from a pleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous mater.” The\ndefendant ignores that even in that context, “motions to strike are disfavored and should not be\ngranted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.

Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. llo9, llo (D. Nev. l988),\nwhich the defendant cites (Def. Mem. at 54), is also inapposite.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen. Juror No. 5o’s\npresence on the jury deprived Ms. Maxwell of the fair and impartial jury the due process and the\nSixth Amendment guarantee.

Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548 (l984) and holding that the requirement of a fair and impartial jury is “reflected in\nthe McDonough standard for analyzing allegations that a juror’s false voir dire concealed bias\nthat affected the fairness of the trial: a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias\nmust demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\n\n‘Tt appears that, at best, Ms. Maxwell had lo fair and impartial jurors, not the l2\nguaranteed her by the United States Constitution. We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9875", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 24 of 32\nE. This Court should reject the government’s atempt to manufacture a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: were\nyour false answers to Questions 25 and 48 merely inadvertent; and, even though you were a\nvictim of child sexual abuse, isn’t it true that you were a fair and impartial juror (even though\nyou have admited using your oun experience to convince lo other jurors to convict Ms.\nMaxwell)? The government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permited to question Juror No. 5o, as occurred recently in this\njudicial district.? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"We therefore\ncaution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror’s impartiality remains in the\nwake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should\nbe held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased probability of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv. Int’! L.J. 257, 26o (2oo7); see also\nPurvis v. Oest, 6l4 F.3d 7l3, 7l8 (7th Cir. 2olo) (“fundamentally biased process is\nnot due process”); Schacht v. Wis.

(Tr. 3o2).\nAnd both Jane and Annie Farmer testified about massages. (Tr. 3o8-ll; 2o83-86).\n\nThe government’s atempt to characterize Count Three as an “earlier scheme” and Count\nFive as a “later pyramid scheme” with different objects and methods is unavailing. (Opp. at 32).\nThe government’s theory, as presented to the jury, was that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell engaged in\na single conspiracy with a common method of operation and objective: to recruit and “groom”\nunderage girls to sexually abuse them. That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment\nonly on Count Three.\n\nIi. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Other Motions.\n\nFor the reasons already set forth in her initial Motion, the Court should vacate Ms.\nMaxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due to prejudicial pre-\nindictment delay.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010332.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 9 of 4o\navailable information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary\nhearing.” Dkt. No. 57o.l\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 33, on the basis of Juror 5o’s statements. Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity. Hearing Tr. at 3-5. Juror 5o confirmed he understood\nthat if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury. /d. at 5. The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire.

Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l7\n(l982). One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof. United States v. Ventura, No.\no9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4); see United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989). And while Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such\naction must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary circumstances.’” United States v.\nArcher, 977 F.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34\n(2d Cir. 2ool)).\n\nThe parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s alleged\nnondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984).

A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” Black’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooll265", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government seeks to have the motion briefed before jury selection\nbegins.\n\nImplicit in the language of Rule 4l2(c)(l)(B) is authority for the Court to permit a\ndefendant to file a motion closer to trial than l4 days, for good cause. But contrary to the\ngovernment’s suggestion, the Rule does not contemplate a deadline more than l4 days before\ntrial.!\n\nIn any event, Ms. Maxwell should not be required to file her Rule 4l2 motion any time\nbefore November l5, since it was just three days ago (October ll) that the government disclosed\nits 35oo material, including more than 8,ooo pages of testifying witness disclosures. It will\nrequire significant time and resources to review and investigate this material and to identify any\npotentially admissible Rule 4l2 evidence.\n\nIt was also just three days ago that the government alerted defense counsel to its\nanticipated Rule 4o4(b) witnesses. Rule 4l2’s procedures apply not just to alleged victims named\nin the indictment but to any alleged victim in a case involving sexual misconduct, including\nalleged 4o4(b) victims. Fed. R.

I also issued several press releases during the claims process that\nhighlight confidentiality as a “cornerstone” of the EVCP and of “paramount importance.”\nCopies of EVCP press releases are atached as Exhibits B, C, and F. Through numerous public\nforums, confidentiality was discussed as a centerpiece of the Program.\n\nll. The express condition of confidentiality significantly informed the way I\nadministered the Program and approached the claims process. I implemented a trauma-informed\nprocess where claimants could share information freely and openly without feeling the need to\ncensor themselves - not only about the events that gave rise to the claim but also the often\nprofound impact on their lives. I spent months building trust and confidence in this alternative\ndispute resolution process among claimants and their atorneys — a process that was new and\nunfamiliar to many of them. I dispensed with formal rules of <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> or evidence that would\napply in a court of law in favor of a less formal, non-adversarial approach.

All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A.

For that reason, for individuals living in other\ncountries, we will accept notarization by a notarizing officer at a U.S.\nEmbassy or Consulate or an equivalent alternative document authentication\nmechanism acceptable in that country. For Claimants having difficulty due\nto the COVID-l9 pandemic, most states have enacted statutes or Executive\nOrders to allou alternatives, such as via video conference or fax.

The government’s Memorandum\n(Dkt. 796) cloaks itself in Jn re Craig, but that case emphasized that disclosure\nrequires the most careful judgment and that “the public's curiosity in a defendant’s\nsecret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to\nsecrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” l3l F.3d 99, lo5 (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\nBecause this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.\n\nTl.

In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)).

Id. at 49l. The\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court’s order directing the public disclosure of\nBiaggi’s testimony based solely on his waiver, finding that “no mater hou much, or\nhou legitimately, the public may want to knou whether a candidate for high public\noffice has invoked the privilege against self-incrimination before a grand jury, or has\nlied about having done so, that interest must generally yield to the larger one of\npreserving the salutary rule of law embodied in Rule 6(e) of Federal Rules of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately\ndecade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young\nwomen and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC.

As the Memorandum concluded, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId.

It ordered\nthe Government, by July 29, 2o25, to file a memorandum addressing the factors identified in Jn\n7 The same day, the DAG filed a similar motion on the docket of Epstein’s case.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'!

Tell them the exact location and\nnature of the fire.\nAsk al] guests to Jeave their rooms.\nNever use the elevator. It could stop between floors.\nWhen you exit the building during a fire, close all doors as you exit to confine the fire.\nMake sure that everyone leaves with you.\nHeat, smoke and gases emited by burning materials can quickly choke you. If you are\ncaught in heavy smoke, get doun on the floor and crawl. Take short breaths, breathing\nthrough your nose.\nIf your clothes catch fire, don’t run. Stop where you are, drop to the ground, cover your\nface with your hands to protect your face and lungs and rol] over to smother the flames.\nDo not overestimate your ability to put out a fire. Most fires cannot be easily or safely\nextinguished. Do not atempt to put the fire out once it be gins to quickly spread.\nHURRICANE SEASON\nThe season generally runs from June through November with the peak period being in\nAugust and September.\nDuring this time, it is necessary to monitor all weather systems on a daily basis, either via\nthe television, internet or radio. Guests must be advised of the situation.\nAll outdoor furniture and loose items must be stored inside. Poted plants are moved into\nareas with the least wind or placed indoors.\nAll shuters are closed.\n2/l4/2oo5 Sy\nDOJ-OGR-oool5786", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015799.jpg": "|\n| | POINTS OF DEPARTURE & ARRIVAL REMARKS, PROCEDURES, AIRCRAFT CATEGORY\n| DATE AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS, ENDORSEMENTS\n' AIRCRAFT MAKE | IDENTIFICATION FROM To MILES] FLT.\nl9¢l] AND MODEL MARK LOWN| NO.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case.

THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUEST FOR INTERVENTION\nThe Government is not a party to this civil action against Maxwell, and therefore does not\nhave standing to move for a stay of this action. Thus, for the limited purpose of seeking a stay,\nthe Government has sought leave to intervene in the action. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at l.) This\nCourt finds it unnecessary, houever, to deal with the Government’s leter in an “intervention”\nframework, which would require an inquiry as to whether the Government meets the standards\nset out in Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. Rather, given that a motion for a stay\nhas already been made by Maxwell, this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that\nmotion and in the exercise of its discretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an\namicus curiae. See, e.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558 U.S. 256, 288 (2olo)\n(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation as an alternative to\nintervention.”); Washington State Inv. Bd. v.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l PP. 9/l2\nDOJ-OGR- oool9468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019469.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pmyG7ReO2OcetB@828o2 Paget2 of l25\ncriminal maters that had related civil litigation.

Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide\npotential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.\nSee Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be\nsubject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them\nby the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019503.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeRB MOB 3o o4TMe Deter? 29-o2 OF RES O7827 289 Aagef J 2b l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~- eee eee eet LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° DROW ERT VE ONDER\n-v.- : CO\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n- eee eee eee LLL\nALISON J.

Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019520.jpg": "Odsedl ADA SBos ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 628/PAg Kayei6l 257\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019522.jpg": "CaSeide2QoeROOB 2o o4IN ce Detlnien? 2-o2 OF RES O7928/289 Paget l 2b l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s designation of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that designation is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the redactions\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\nApp.o95\nDOJ-OGR-oool9554", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019559.jpg": "Came POBO OOBBoAIeht DOCORBAT-AIL o Fd l87o2289 hag eoP HS\nreference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case.

No. 29,\nEx. A ¥ l(a). That language was included in the Court’s July 3o, 2o2o protective order. See Dkt.\nNo. 36 §f l(a), lo(a), l4(a).

Tn the civil context, there is a “strong presumption against the modification of a protective order.” In re Teligent,\nInc., 64o F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citation omited).

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case.

The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee. This defendant should not be granted the special treatment she requests.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, she has significant assets and foreign ties,\nshe has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek\nher detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Victims Seek Detention\n\nAs the Court is aware, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), a crime\nvictim has the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court,\nincluding proceedings involving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that\nrequirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with\nits application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020012.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel53 of 2oo 9o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl evidentiary hearing within one week. In contrast, the\n\n2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted\n\n3 defendant who is incarcerated in terms of the need to access\n\n4 counsel. Indeed the defense's logic, all pretrial detainees\n\n5 currently incarcerated at MDC and any federal facility would\n\n6 need to be released to prepare their defense. To the contrary,\n7 the MDC has continued to develop procedures to ensure\n\n8 atorney-client access at the facility, and the defendants\n\n9 detained at MDC are able to conduct video and phone conferences\nlo with their atorneys. There is ongoing litigation before\n\nll Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the\n\nl2 adequacy of atorney-client access at the MDC. That is case\n\nl3 No. l9 Civ. 66o. Public filings from the court-appointed\n\nl4 mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone\nl5 calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of\n\nl6 reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their\n\nl7 counsel, and that same report indicates that MDC is currently\nl8 developing a plan to resume in-person atorney-client visits in\nl9 the near future.\n2o At this stage in this case and at this point in the\n2l pandemic in New York City, these measures are sufficient to\n22 ensure Ms. Maxwell has access to her counsel. To further\n23 assuage these concerns, the court orders the government in this\n24 case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the\n25 defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ool2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020019.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl272 lF ROG9822o4/(2ag Fiagject 2o45\nStatutes\nRules\nRule 5(F) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ..................o..ccccccecccseceee cee eens seeeseeteeseeeesneeeee D\niV\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ool9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020025.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT/OD2 FileebBa3o/ Page age Aafl26mo45\ncontest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France.” We also provide\nopinions from experts in the extradition laws of the France and the United Kingdom\nstating that it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to resist extradition\nfrom either country in the event she were granted bail and somehou fled to either\ncountry, which she has no intention of doing.

Ms. Maxwell has nou been detained\nfor over l5o days in the equivalent of solitary confinement since she was\nindicted and arrested on July 2, 2o2o, despite the fact that she is not a suicide\nrisk and has not received a single disciplinary infraction. The draconian\nconditions to which Ms. Maxwell is subjected are not only unjust and\npunitive, but also impair her ability to review the voluminous discovery\nproduced by the government and to participate meaningfully in the\npreparation of her defense. Furthermore, the recent COVID-l9 outbreak\nat the MDC threatens her safety and well-being.\nMs. Maxwell Should Be Placed on Restrictive Bail Conditions\nDuring her more than five months in isolation, Ms. Maxwell has had to watch as she has\nbeen relentlessly atacked in a deluge of media articles that spiked over a year ago when Epstein\n?

(Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New Hampshire, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing.

(Tr. 55-56). Having nou reviewed the discovery produced by the government,\nit is clear that Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government makes her out to\nbe and was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by law enforcement.\n\nFirst, the cellphone in question was subscribed in the name of “Terramar Project,\nInc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make calls as late as May 2o2o, just before her\narrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been concerned that the authorities\nwere using it to track her. Third, Ms. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in the name of\n“G Max” that she was using as her primary phone, which was not covered.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

(Id. at l). This rule is necessitated by the French\nConstitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).\nThus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition\ntreaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government’s reliance on a 2oo6 case—in which France refused to extradite a\nFrench national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to hou a French court\nwould rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the\nUnited States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it\nundermine Mr. Julie’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries\nhas executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a\nU.S. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3).\n\nThe government offers no rebutal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition\nexpert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly\nunlikely” to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government’s representation\nat the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at\n4/39). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (atached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the\nwaiver would be “a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of\nextradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Jd. 93).’\n\n’ Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after a\ncourt has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). That discretion is limited to a handful of\nexceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\ncombination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020138.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehRa3o/PtagPagefliss 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s\n\nAppearance in Court\n\nAs set forth above, Ms. Maxwell nou proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate\nany means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore\nreconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.\nRoue, No. o2 CR. 756 LMM, 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3) (“[A] release\norder may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to\nthe movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. l5-CR-66-\nLTS, 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for\nreconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).\n\nA. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship\n\nTo demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide\nfurther assurance to the Court that she will not atempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is\nwilling to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should\nthe Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submited to the\nappropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s\npassports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.\n\nIf the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally\ncommence the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the\nprocess of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately\nupon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,\nmay be expedited.\n\nCitizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up\ncitizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020163.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoB3onAeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5i , BilEGH3lo972 he Reigef 3 Ob 9\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020170.jpg": "CaSeshZoero33o.AENt DoesuieAt MAEl, FitethOR/dZQel Plage Hof 2\nMINISTERE a ae ;\nDE LA JUSTICE Direction des affaires criminelles et des graces\nLiberte\nEgatite\nFraternite\nSous-direction de la justice penale specialisee\nBureau de l’entraide penale internationale .\nP Paris, le 9 mars 2o2l\nMonsieur le garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice\na\nDepartment of Justice (D.O,J)\nPar lintermediaire d’ Andrew FINKELMAN, magistrat de haison\nAmbassade des Etats-Unis d “Amerique a Paris\nJ'ai Thonneur de porter 4 votre connaissance que la <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> et les conditions\n@extradition sont regies en France par les articles 696 et suivants du code de <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> penale.\nLarticle 696-2 de ce code prevoit ainsi que « /e gouvernement francais peut remetre, sur leur\ndemande, aux fouverncments trangers, toute personne n'ayant pas la nationalite francaise qui, etant l'objet d'une\npoursuite intentee au nom de I'Etat requerant ou d'une condamnation prononcee par ses tribunaux, est trouvee sur\nke territoire de la Republique. »\nVarticle 694-4 precise expfessement que :\n« L' extradition n'est pas accordee :\nl° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite Jrangaise, cete detniere etant appreciee a\nI'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\ns\\insl, le fait que la personne recherchee ait la nationalite frangaise constitue un obstacle\ninsurmontable 4 son extradition.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so.

Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so.

Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

Hence, “[w]hen a\nparty seeks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion is considered ‘an\ninterlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to review and\nrevise interlocutory rulings prior to entry of final judgment.’” Wagner Equip. Co. v. Wood, 289\nF.R.D. 347, 349 (D.N.M. 2ol3) (quoting Wagoner v. Wagoner, 938 F.2d ll2o, ll22 n.l (loth Cir.\nl99l)). The Court’s authority, then, is sustained by the pragmatic reality that a “district court\nshould have the opportunity to correct alleged errors in its dispositions.” Christy, 739 F.3d at 539.\nConsequently, the district court enjoys “considerable discretion in ruling on a motion to\nreconsider.” Federated Touing & Recovery, LLC v. Praetorian Ins. Co., 283 F.R.D. 644, 65l\n(D.N.M. 2ol2) (citing Phelps v. Hamilton, l22 F.3d l3o9, l324 (loth Cir. l997)).\n\nThe scope of reconsideration, houever, is narrouly cabined and far more limited than in\nan ordinary appeal. That is, a motion to reconsider is an “inappropriate vehicle[] to reargue an\nissue previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advances new arguments, or\nsupporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.” Servants of Paraclete\nv.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic.

Nevertheless, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).

Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex.

And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o264", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020265.jpg": "CaSeade2Zol ep QO3SBOvAUNt BQutren2BB 2hile@ l2/OA/ 26a cragef ZF 2\ninmates are breathing and not in distress. Inmates in BOP custody are subject to searches, including\nbody scanners, and inmates may be searched prior to moving from one area of the facility to another.\nThe removal of Ms. Maxwell’s face mask complies with the BOP’s COVID-l9 Pandemic Response Plan.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s arrival, she has been provided three (3) meals a day in accordance with BOP\npolicy and its National Menu. Food Service staff have addressed Ms. Maxwell’s requests. Ms. Maxwell ls\nsetved her breakfast upon entering the common area of the housing unit at 7:oo AM; at noon she is\nserved her lunch; and at 5:oo PM she ts served dinner. Her medical records shou that she currently\nweighs l34 Ibs., which fluctuates plus or minus 2 lbs. Health Services staff make regular rounds of her\nhousing unit and she has been instructed on hou to request medical care through the sick call\nprocedures. Furthermore, while there has been a number of inmates whom have tested positive for\nCOVID-l9, Ms. Maxwell remains in good health and is not in contact with those individuals. The BOP\nstaff is assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s unit do not come in contact with the other individuals whom have\ntested positive. Lastly, the temperature of Ms. Maxwell’s cell is checked three times daily to ensure it ls\nin compliance with national standards.\n\nIn accordance with the BOP’s COVID-l9 Pandemic Response Plan, inmates are alloted 5oo\nminutes per month of social telephone calls, which Ms. Maxwell has used throughout her time at MDC\nBrooklyn. While Ms. Maxwell has received one legal video conference, she continues to have full access\nto legal telephone calls and in person legal visits. Pursuant to the District Courts guidance, legal\ntelephone calls are scheduled through the Federal Defenders, who should be afforded an opportunity to\naddress any concerns Ms. Maxwell’s atorneys have with the legal calls.\n\nI trust this has addressed your concerns.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Sophia Papapetru\n\nSophia Papapetru\n\nStaff Atorney\n\nMDC Brooklyn\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n\n/s/ John Wallace\n\nJohn Wallace\n\nStaff Atorney\n\nMDC Brooklyn\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o265", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020305.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagel5 of 3o\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\nI CERTIFY that this petition complies with the type-volume\nlimitation of FED.

STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020373.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel5 of 24\nabuse of discretion or clear error. See United States v. McCloud, 837 F. App’x 852,\n853 n.3 (2d Cir. 2o2l).\nB. Discussion\n\n28. This Court has already affirmed Judge Nathan’s bail\ndeterminations and denied Maxwell’s application for pretrial release. The only\nchanged circumstance since this Court rendered that decision—Judge Nathan’s\ndetermination that the MDC’s nightime security protocols do not interfere with\nMaxwell’s ability to prepare for trial—does nothing to alter the conclusion that\nJudge Nathan did not clearly err or abuse her discretion when denying Maxwell’s\nprior bail applications.\n\n29. Asan initial mater, it bears noting that Maxwell did not docket\na new appeal from any order entered by Judge Nathan. Instead, she filed her\n“renewed motion” under the same docket as her initial appeal, thereby effectively\nasking the same panel of this Court to reconsider its earlier decision. To the extent\nthis motion is construed as one for panel reconsideration, it is untimely under Federal\nRule of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 4o(a)(l) and Local Rules 4o.l and 4o.2.\n\n3o. In addition, since this Court denied Maxwell’s bail appeal,\nMaxwell has not filed a renewed motion for bail or temporary release in the District\nCourt based on any alleged changed circumstances. As this Court has explained in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020374.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel6 of 24\n\nthe context of post-conviction bail proceedings, “given the findings that must be\nmade in order to warrant release, it is generally more appropriate that the motion be\nmade initially in the district court.” United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342, 344\n(2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam); see Fed. R. App. P. 9(a) (providing for appeals from\ndetention orders); cf. generally Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. l, 6 (l95l) (explaining,\nbefore passage of the Bail Reform Act, that “[t]he proper <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for challenging\nbail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of\nAppeals from an order denying such motion”). The Order Maxwell annexes to her\nmotion—an Order regarding security checks at the MDC (Mot. Ex. B)—ls not a bail\ndetermination, and Maxwell has not taken an appeal from that Order. See Fed. R.\nApp. P. 9(a) (requiring that a party appealing a detention order must file “a copy of\nthe district court’s order . . . as soon as practicable after filing the notice of appeal’).\nNo bail determination is properly before this Court.\n\n3l. In any event, Maxwell’s “renewed motion” is substantively\nmeritless. This Court has already held that Judge Nathan did not commit clear error\nin finding, three times, that the Government established by a preponderance of the\nevidence that Maxwell is a risk of flight and no bail conditions could reasonably\nassure her appearance in court. This Court has also concluded that Judge Nathan\ndid not abuse her discretion or clearly err in determining that Maxwell’s conditions\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020376.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel8 of 24\n\n34. Consistent with her practice throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Judge Nathan carefully considered Maxwell’s most recent complaint that\nnightime security checks by MDC staff interfere with her ability to prepare for trial.\nWhen Maxwell asked Judge Nathan to direct the MDC either to modify its nightime\nsurveillance procedures or to justify those procedures, Judge Nathan solicited a\nresponse from the MDC and evaluated the explanation provided. In so doing,\nJudge Nathan focused on whether the MDC implemented the contested protocol\nbased on neutral factors that justify any deviation from the ordinary practice.\n\n35. Maxwell faults Judge Nathan for not “tell[ing] the Bureau of\nPrisons what to do.” (Mot. at 2). But even assuming that it were proper for a\nDistrict Court to instruct the Bureau of Prisons regarding the details of operating a\njail, Maxwell fails to explain why it was unreasonable to conclude that an increase\nof nightime checks from the 3o-minute intervals applicable in the SHU to the l5-\nminute intervals applied to Maxwell was warranted given the specific factors that\nheighten safety and security concerns for Maxwell. Unlike most other inmates,\nMaxwell does not have a cellmate who could alert staff if she was in distress, and\nMaxwell faces very serious charges under the glare of a high-profile case, the stress\nof which increases the possibility that she may self-harm. Moreover, as Judge\nNathan noted, Maxwell offered no evidence to support the notion that those\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o376", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020377.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Pagel9 of 24\nnightime checks involve shining a flashlight directly into her eyes (as opposed to\nthe ceiling), that the checks in fact disturb her sleep, or that the checks prevent her\nfrom being able to prepare her defense.*\n\n36. It bears emphasis that Maxwell’s appeal ostensibly concerns a\nmotion for pretrial release, such that the conditions of her confinement are relevant\nonly insofar as they affect her ability to prepare for trial. As this Court previously\nrecognized, the appropriate avenue for Maxwell to raise concerns about her ability\nto prepare for trial is through an application to the District Court. Maxwell availed\nherself of that process, but in so doing offered no evidence that the MDC’s security\nprotocols are unjustified or interfering with her preparation for trial. Tellingly,\n3 Maxwell repeatedly accuses the Government of making misrepresentations during\nthe course of this case. It is correct that the MDC informed the Government that\nMaxwell wore an eye mask at night, when in fact she uses other non-contraband\nitems to cover her eyes. The Government conveyed the MDC’s imprecise language\nin an April 6, 2o2l leter to Judge Nathan but has since recognized and\nacknouledged the inaccuracy. The remaining accusations, houever, are\nunfounded. For example, Maxwell takes Government counsel’s statement at oral\nargument about nightime checks being “routine” out of context when claiming that\nit involved some representation that all inmates experience flashlight checks every\nl5 minutes. To the contrary, when asked whether the nightime checks were\nconducted at that interval for every inmate, Government counsel clarified, “I can’t\nspeak to what is done as to all inmates.” Only after conferring with the MDC did\nthe Government convey to Judge Nathan, and nou this Court, the MDC’s procedures\nfor nightime checks of all inmates. The Government has and will continue to\naccurately represent the information it receives from the MDC when necessary to\nrespond to Maxwell’s complaints or inquiries from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o377", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020378.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2o of 24\n\nMaxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application\nfor pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its\noperations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s\nprotocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well\nwithin her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.\nEven in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s\nconditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation\nfor trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused\nher substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or\ntemporary release.\n\n37. To the extent Maxwell nou raises new complaints about\nconditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the\nDistrict Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with\nher concerns about nightime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to\nsupport her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from\npreparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare\nassertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides\ninadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflous\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o378", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020382.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page24 of 24\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 32(g), the undersigned counsel\n\nhereby certifies that this opposition complies with the type-volume limitation of\nthe Federal Rules of Appellate <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel4 of 9l\n\nlo/o7/2o2o | 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter,\nthe Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to\ncounsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest.

Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video\ntapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248,\nEx. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of\nthose materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense\ncounsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is\ndenied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the\nopportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all\nrelevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates\nin BOP custody.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020501.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel5 of 92\n\nlo/o7/2o2o 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions\nthat the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having\nconsidered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's\nrequests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction\nrequests, with the exceptions discussed belou. Finally, the Court denies the\nGovernments request to file Exhibit ll entirely under seal. While portions of that\ntranscript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record.

On April 2l, 2o2l, the Court's Chambers received a\nleter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for\nhis client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The leter requests anonymity on\nbehalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the leter,\nthe Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to\ncounsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 2l,\n2o2l leter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party\nasserting that interest. The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel\nfor the non—party. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/2l)Gjbo)\n(Entered: o5/o3/2o2l)\n\no5/o3/2o2l | 265 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has received an exchange of leters that\npertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2o2l. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,\n259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.\n255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over\ncopies of video tapes of the in-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video\ntapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation leter. Dkt. No. 248,\nEx. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of\nthose materials as a mater of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense\ncounsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is\ndenied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the\nopportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all\nrelevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates\nin BOP custody.

ENDORSEMENT:\nThe request for an extension of time until May 2l, 2o2l to respond to the Court's May\nll, 2o2l Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

ENDORSEMENT: The\nCourt grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is\nguided by the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid\nCo. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court concludes that these are\njudicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of\naccess atach. Id. at ll92o. In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put\nforward in this leter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties\nand alleged victims, favor the narrouly tailored redactions.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n<span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

Nathan on\n3/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual\nshouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5 minutes at night.\nDkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is\ndisrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand\ntrial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal\ncounsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In\nresponse, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates\nas a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with\ncell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes.\nInmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night\nat regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,\nflashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,\nbreathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral\nreasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those\nof other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and\nthe potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has\ndetermined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The\nGovernment also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable\npolicy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover\nher eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with\nMaxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense\ncounsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 43/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o665", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020671.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page53 of 2o8\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nresolves Dkt.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

The Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) \"guarantees to\nthe victims of federal crimes an array of substantive and participatory rights, including\nthe rights to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving\nrelease, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding, to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case, and to receive full and timely restitution as provided in law.\"\nUnited States v.

The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative\nto compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.\nThe Court concludes that the charges in the $l superseding indictment are clear enough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7, an indictment must contain “a plain,\nconcise, and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.”\nThe indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allou the\ndefendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United\nStates v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under this test, an indictment need do\nlitle more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in\napproximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d lo87, ll3 (2d\nCir. l975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. l987).\n\nThe Sl superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts\nsupporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague\nbecause it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and\nplace of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d at ll3. The details are\nsubject to proof at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o778", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020782.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel64 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 34\ncivil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that\nMaxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the\nfactfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9; Kross, l4 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a\nreasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permited the\nplaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs\ntestimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial\nresolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the “inviolable function of the\njury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is\ninextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that\ndispute on a Rule l2(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 27o, 28l (2d Cir. 2ol8).\n\nThe Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately\npresented to the jury.\n\nV. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately\n\nAlthough the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of\njustice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts\ntogether with the Mann Act counts would require admiting evidence of other acts likely to be\nunduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their\ninvolvement in the earlier civil case.\n\nRule l4(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> allous a court to order separate\ntrials if joming all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking\nseverance must shou significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting\nmultiple trials. United States v. Walker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to the\ndefendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o782", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020797.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel79 of 2o8\nA-l75\nCase l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 3 of l5\nof Title l8, United States Code, Section 2423(b); and\n\n(5) knouingly, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting,\n\nenticing, and obtaining by any means a person, knouing that the person had\nnot atained the age of l8 years and would be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex act as defined in l8 U.S.C. § l59l(c)(l); in violation of Title\nl8, United States Code, Sections l59l(a)(l) and 2; and\n\nIT APPEARING that Epstein secks to resolve globally his state and federal criminal\nliability and Epstein understands and acknouledges that, in exchange for the benefits\nprovided by this agreement, he agrees to comply with its terms, including undertaking certain\nactions with the State Atorney's Office:\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background by\nboth State and Federal Jaw enforcement agencies, and after due consultation with the State\nAtorney's Office, that the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, and the\nDefendant will be served by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020952.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel26 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 9 of 4o\n\navailable information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary\nhearing.” Dkt.

Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity.

The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire.

Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies.

Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'! Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because .. . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...\nthought they were prostitutes .. . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, ... I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.!* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nAo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nu Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nR U.S. Const. amend.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021239.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6S 3536o38, Page67 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 65 of 348\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when... more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021255.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8l 3536o38, Page83 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\n\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021263.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 89 3536o38, Page9l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 89 of 348\nforward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.”!%\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021264.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Eoo 3536o38, Page92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9o of 348\nnoted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ... a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l264", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021277.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo3 3536o38, Pagelo5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021278.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagelo6 of 258\nSA-lo4\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo4 of 348\nI. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach ... an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021288.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagell6 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l288", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021289.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ATIS 3536o38, Pagell7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims].

The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.’\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 38\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.'** The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nlS As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl4 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l323", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021326.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ED 3536o38, Pagel54 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !°°\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2. Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts. First, defendants have challenged the voluntariness of the resulting plea\nl28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021356.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel84 of 258\nSA-l82\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l82 of 348\nincluding one called by the USAO to offer the NPA term sheet resolution—and a sixth meeting\ntogether with the State Atorney and the lead state prosecutor to discuss the state plea.

Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021380.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 3o6 3536o38, Page2o8 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o6 of 348\n“[’m reconstructing memories of... l2 years ago.

Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made.

OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed .. . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l38o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021473.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3597 | 3536o39, Page43 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\n\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes.*?”\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\nae5 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n426 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\nseh Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021500.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page/o of 2l7\nSA-324\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 324 of 348\nsignature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

The Defendant contends that the current\npaper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing. /d. In\nthe alternative the Defendant requests an evidentiary hearing to inquire into Juror 5o’s alleged\nnondisclosure. She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that\nsuggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 49. The Government urges\nthis Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited\nhearing on the issue of whether Juror 5o provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the\nquestionnaire. Gov. Br. at 3l-32.\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.\nDefendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 5o\nregarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from considering\nunder Rule 6o6.

The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s\nalleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22-28; Gov. Br. at ll. In McDonough, the\nSupreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire,\n“a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\ndire, and then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d\n32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994); United States\nv. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993).?\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or\nany juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these\nmaters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n> The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false\nanswer. But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s incorrect answer is relevant to this\ninquiry. Maxwell Reply at l3-l4. Because, as explained belou, the Court does not nou resolve at this juncture\nwhether Juror 5o’s answers on the questionnaire and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve\nthose disputes pre-hearing.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l528", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021542.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagell2 of 2l7\nSA-366\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l8 of 2l\nmust be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 544. The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the questionnaire and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire.

In the alternative, houever, the statute is—\nat worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it\nshould proceed to Landgraf step two, which examines\nthe retroactive effects of the statute.\n\ni. Landgraf Step Two\n\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Landgraf,\n“le]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-\nplying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is unques-\ntionably proper in many situations.” 5ll U.S. at 273.\n“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely be-\ncause it is applied in a case arising from conduct ante-\ndating the statute’s enactment, or upsets expectations\nbased in prior law.” Id. at 269. Instead, the question is\nwhether the statute “would impair rights a party pos-\nsessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for\npast conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\ntransactions already completed.” Jd. at 28o. Im-\nportantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-\nstituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does\nnot make application of the rule at trial retroactive,”\nbecause parties have “diminished reliance interests in\nmaters of <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-\ndure regulate secondary rather than primary con-\nduct.” Id. at 275.\n\nIn Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,\n49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. l995), this Court considered a new\nstatute of limitations that shortened the time to file\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l697", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021716.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page69 of 93\n56\nB. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 33(a) permits\na district court to “vacate any judgment and grant a\nnew trial if the interest of justice so requires.” As this\nCourt has explained, “[t]he defendant bears the bur-\nden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under\nRule 33, and before ordering a new trial pursuant to\nRule 33, a district court must find that there is a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been con-\nvicted.” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475\n(2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nPost-verdict inquiries into juror conduct are\nstrongly disfavored. Such inquiries “seriously disrupt\nthe finality of the process.” Tanner v. United States,\n483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l (l987). Permiting “post-verdict\nscrutiny of juror conduct” would undermine pillars\nthat undergird the jury trial right, including “full and\nfrank discussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness\nto return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s\ntrust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeo-\nple.” Jd. Such inquiries may instead “lead to evil con-\nsequences: subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting\njuryroom deliberation, burdening courts with merit-\nless applications, increasing temptation for jury tam-\npering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir.\nl989).\n\nAccordingly, a defendant seeking Rule 33 relief\nbased on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a stringent two-part test.

Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details\nsurrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at l66. The Court also noted the absence of a\ntextual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at l66\nn.7o. The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative\nhistory, namely, the inclusion of Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) in a statute intended to “afford\nminor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at l66.\n\nThe Court contrasted Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) with another portion of the Act that\ncontains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because\nthat text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-\nphasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as correctional officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9. (ll/25/2ol9 - Docket Minute Entry).\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022030.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 7 of 38\nThis refusal is perplexing and nonsensical because these same government prosecutors presented\nthe defendant with a consent to search document from the office of the Inspector General. (See\nExhibit C.)\n\nThis motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding\nimportant and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with\ninformation that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Iefitey Epstein. (See article atached as Exhibit D.)\n\n| Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive\ninvestigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). The United States Atorney\nGeneral, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer\nboth made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth\ninvestigation into the Bureau of Prisons’ policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a\ndirect result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August lo, 2ol9. (See Exhibit D.) This\nreport is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is\nmaterial and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant’s assertion that staffing issues,\nstarfing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go\nto the heart ofhis defense to the government’s criminal allegations.\n\nThe government’s response to Mr. Thomas’ discovery request was not detailed and\nsunply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal\njustification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to\nthe items originally requested by his counsel. |\n\nCc. The Inspector General’s Report and Any Other Reports, Documents,\n\nand/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the\nIncident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and\nMust Be Produced\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o3o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022031.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 8 of 38\nAs stated previously, there is no dispute that multiple investigations by numerous federal\nagencies were opened to investigate the events surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein on\nAugust lo, 2ol9, Michael Thomas is charged with certain crimes resulting from this same event. .\n. On August lo, 2ol9, the Washington Examiner, reported under the headline: “Barr announces\nDOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death.” (See Exhibit D.) On December 28,\n2ol9, Reuters reported under the headline: “FBI investigating Jeffrey Epstein’s inner circle.”! On\nSeptember ll, 2ol9, CNN reported under the headline: “The Jeffrey Epstein investigation was\nmore expansive than previously thought, documents shou.” This news clip refers to what\nappears to be a separate investigation by the U.S. Marshals Service. On the Wikipedia page ,\n| entitled, “Death of Jeffrey Epstein,” the follouing appears, among other information: “After\ninitially expressing suspicion, Atorney General William Barr described Epstein’s death as ‘a\n. perfect storm of screw-ups.’ Both the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General\nare conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death.*”\nD. The Information Sought by This Motion.\nIn the minute entry on the docket, of November 25, 2ol9, this Court noted, among other\nthings, “The Government shall produce discovery to the defense by December 3l, 2ol9.” This\ndiscovery was not produced. Because the government has failed to meet the disclosure mandates\nof Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio, this motion seeks to compel the government to produce the\n; follouing: l) Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein and the Bureau\nof Prisons’ policies and procedures; 2) any reports, witness statements, memorandum, and\ndocuments from any separate investigation conducted by the BOP; and 3) any reports, witness\nstatements and/or documents created by any other federal agencies that investigated the\ncircumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein that have not already been disclosed.\n: See.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that “evidence\nis material under Rule l6 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022060.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 37 of 38\nae\n7 Cross counting of housing units: (TABLED) .\nUNION: Has requested the responses from the 6/28/l8 LMR.\nMANAGEMENT: Management will provide responses to the union’s inquiries communicated\non June 28, 2ol8 by the next LMR meeting scheduled for September 26, 2ol9.\nLunch Reliefs: (TABLED)\nQuarterly Roster: (CLOSED)\nNon-lniform staif atire: (TABLED)\nNew Agenda Items:\nCorrectional Services Annual Leave Schedule: (TABLED)\nMANAGEMENT: Management states they will like to reduce the annual leave schedule from 7\n- weeks to 5 weeks,\nUNION: The union states they do not agree with the reduction of annual leave slots, it’sa\n“ violation of the contract as its not fair and equitable.

Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials\n\nThe defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in\nresponse to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with\nRule l6 and its other disclosure obligations, as described belou.\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November ll, 2ol9, Thomas, through counsel, raised\nthe issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the\n“status” of the report and when it would be completed.* (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2ol9, at 3-4, 7-9).\nIn response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the\nresults of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in discovery all of the\nunderlying results of the criminal investigation. . . .

As there was no pending issue to resolve,\nthe Court declined to rule at that time.\n\nOn January 29, 2o2o, Thomas and Noel each submited discovery requests to the\nGovernment. Thomas’s leter reiterated his prior request for “any and all reports, memorandums,\n\n3 The January 3o, 2o2o production was made to Noel’s counsel on January 24, 2o2o, while\nthe Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas’s counsel.\n\n* Based on conversations with atorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the\nGovernment understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of\nJeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022073.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page ll of 34\ndated April l, 2o2o, explaining that any responsive information in the Government’s possession\nand subject to disclosure had already been produced. The leter further explained that to the extent\nthe requests called for items not in the Government’s possession or not subject to disclosure,\nThomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was\nnot aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested\ninformation.\nOn April 9, 2o2o, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court\ncompelling the Government to produce the follouing:\ne The Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein\nand BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the “Inspector\nGeneral’s Report”), as well as all supporting memoranda and other\ndocuments, (Mot. 4-5);\ne Any and all “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding\nthe August lo, 2ol9 incident” as well as “documents, reports, witness\nstatements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who\nhave engaged in the same or similar conduct,” including “results of any\ndisciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding\nthe discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who\nhave failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts,” (Mot. 4, 6);\ne Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents\ncreated by “any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances\nsurrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein,” (Mot. 4, 7).\nFor the reasons that follou, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion\nshould be denied.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022075.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l3 of 34\ndemand for it. 267 F.3d at l46. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do\nnot require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant’s request. Jd. It\nfound that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence\nas well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order\ndisclosure of material it deems material as a mater of case management. Jd. As described above,\nthe Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery\nproductions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as\npotential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial.\n\nB. Rule l6\n\nRule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> requires the Government to permit the\ndefendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government’s possession,\ncustody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to\nuse them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(E). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6 “if it\ncould be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” United States v. Stevens,\n985 F.2d ll75, ll8o-8l (2d Cir. l993).\n\nI. Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials\n\nA. The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy\nits discovery and disclosure obligations.\n\nThe Government has met its Rule l6 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth\nabove, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among\nother things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2ol9 (despite the fact\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022079.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Pagel7 of 34\n\nee Discussion\n\nThomas’s motion makes clear that he intends for his principal defense at trial to be that—\nirrespective of his guilt or innocence of the false statements charges—he should be acquited\nbecause the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was overworked, his supervisors did not catch his\ncrime in the moment, and falsification of count slips is rampant within the BOP. (See Mot. 3\n(“staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP\nprocedures go to the heart of his defense to the government’s criminal allegations”); 9 (“Mr.\nThomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2ol9 led\nto the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is nou criminally charged.”)). Thomas has failed to meet\nhis burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid\ndefense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead\nwould be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification.\n\nThe purported reasons for Thomas’s decision to falsify count slips—being tired,\noverworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those\nissues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas\nintentionally made materially false statements and a/so that did so while tired or overworked, it\nwould still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 2l3, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(holding that “it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the\ndefendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense\nwith which he was charged” (internal citation omited)).\n\nNone of Thomas’s proffered excuses relate to proving or rebuting the elements of a\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false,\nwhether it was material to a mater within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knouingly\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022098.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page 2of9\nPrisons (the “BOP”)] as to both [D]efendants, including[] any and all supporting memorandums,\nwriten statements, photos, videos, and incident reports,” id. at 6; and (3) “any and all reports,\nmemorandums, writen statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured, or\npossessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies[] participating in the investigation of the\n[D]efendants, allied with the prosecution, and to which the prosecution has access,” id. at 7.\n\nFor the reasons stated belou, Thomas’ motion is DENIED.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe Government has already produced “surveillance video going back to July 5,\n\n2ol9. ..; count slips, thirty minute round forms, and staffing rosters for the three-week period\nsurrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone records; employee files and staffing history\nfor Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of writen [BOP] policies and regulations,” as well as\n“statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation.” Gov’t Opp. at 8-9,\nECF No. 35.\n\nThomas argues that he is entitled to additional discovery on two grounds: (l) Rule l6 of\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>, and (2) the constitutional guarantee of due process as\nexpressed by the Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v.

Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally knoun New York criminal\ndefense atorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer\nto dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by atacking the credibility of the victim\nwitnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Atorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the\ncase to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2ol6,\nhis office prosecuted minors as young as l4 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s\nvictims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and\naccording to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek\ntold OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an\norganized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we .. .\nthought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.” Houever, she said, although\nEpstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can\ncharge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to\nmy mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice\nwas to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.\n\nC. Florida State <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> for Bringing Criminal Charges\n\nFederal criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable\nby imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”\nUnder Florida law, houever, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death\npenalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Atorney has concurrent authority to file criminal\ncharges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.\nAlthough Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often\nutilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by\npublic officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among\nlo Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.\nA Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Atorney’s Office’s\nhandling of the Epstein case was pending at the tme OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR\nhis office’s prosecutive decisions.\nl2 U.S. Const. amend.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023077.jpg": "I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .&\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.°*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\nom Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023093.jpg": "charges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023101.jpg": "forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023102.jpg": "noted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ...a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo8 Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023115.jpg": "everything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafafia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. !*° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nll The standard <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we . . . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023116.jpg": "l. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023126.jpg": "a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023127.jpg": "that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.'3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8’ The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l).!°?

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023166.jpg": "the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose.

See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules.

Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.jpg": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.jpg": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.jpg": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3lo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.jpg": "investigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims identified in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of identified victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *”7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2oo8).\n\n27l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.jpg": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n485 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.jpg": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023369.jpg": "moved by medical staff to the MCC New York Health Service Unit.’ The Clinical Nurse continuously\nadministered CPR until he was relieved by outside Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) when they arrived\nat the Health Services Area minutes later. The EMTs continued CPR, intubated Epstein, and administered\nmedication and fluids in their efforts to revive him. At approximately 7:lo a.m., Epstein was transported by\nthe EMTs in an ambulance to New York Presbyterian Louer Manhatan Hospital, where he was pronounced\ndead by an emergency room physician at 7:36 a.m. On August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, performed an autopsy on Epstein and determined that the cause of death was\nhanging and the manner of death was suicide.\nThe OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s\ninvestigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause\nof Epstein’s death. The FBI determined that there was no criminality pertaining to hou Epstein had died.\nThis report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC New York personnel’s custody, care, and supervision\nof Epstein during his detention at the facility from his arrest on July 6, 2ol9, until his death on\nAugust lo, 2ol9.\nThe OIG investigation and review identified numerous and serious failures by MCC New York staff, as well as\nmultiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures. Among the most significant was the\nfailure to assign Epstein a new cellmate on August 9, 2ol9, after Epstein’s cellmate was transferred out of\nMCC New York that day. Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times pursuant to a writen direction\nthat the MCC New York Psychology Department issued on July 3o after Epstein was removed from suicide\nwatch and psychological observation follouing a possible atempted suicide by him on July 23. As a result of\nthe failure to assign him a new cellmate, Epstein was housed alone in his cell from the night of August 9\nuntil he was found hanged in his cell by SHU staff at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing morning. In\naddition, we determined that SHU staff failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds, including\novernight on August 9-lo, and alloued Epstein to have an excess of blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell.\nThese failures compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution,\nand provided Epstein an opportunity to commit suicide while locked alone in his cell on the morning of\nAugust lo without having been subject to overnight observation or supervision by SHU staff.\nThe OIG also found that an MCC New York supervisor had alloued Epstein, in violation of BOP policy, to\nmake an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death to an individual with whom\nhe allegedly had a personal relationship. Further, 2 days before his death, during a meeting with his lawyers\nin a private room at the MCC New York, Epstein signed a new Last Will and Testament, which MCC New York\nofficials did not learn about until after his death.\nAdditionally, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU, including the two SHU staff\non duty the night of August 9-lo, 2ol9, who were stationed at a desk that was directly outside the SHU tier\nin which Epstein was housed and diagonally across from Epstein’s cell, had falsified BOP records to claim\n| Moving an inmate requiring outside emergency medical care to the Health Services Unit provides health care staff and\nEmergency Medical Technicians (EMT) with immediate access to any necessary medical equipment and supplies and\nallous EMTs faster access to the inmate when they arrive at MCC New York because Correctional Officers (CO) can\ndirectly escort EMTs to the Health Services Unit to begin emergency treatment immediately.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide prevention, and security procedures relating to the unit.

Inmate Accountability”\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted.

This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers.

Telephone Calls\nThe federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54o.loo-54o.lo6, that govern telephone calls for inmates require that\nthe Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate telephone conversations, which\nis “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution and to protect the public.” For\nsafety and security reasons, BOP policy (Program Statement P5264.o8, Inmate Telephone Regulations)\nrequires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the Inmate Telephone System. BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens\nFederal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily\nmay have a reasonable amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal\nproperty of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”\"®\nThe BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed.

Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day.

Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems.

Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2's Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. On this date, Epstein was to receive\n\n46\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023414.jpg": "his personally ouned medical device. BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to\nthe SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns. Epstein\nasked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and\nthen return to the SHU with a cellmate the follouing day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was geting along with his cellmate. According to her\nreport, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of\n\n47\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023415.jpg": "harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023416.jpg": "psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies, to which Epstein was receptive. Epstein was\neducated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and also\nreminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The Chief Psychologist wrote that\nEpstein would be seen in weekly SHU rounds and monthly for SHU reviews. The Chief Psychologist told the\nOIG that the fact that Epstein underwent three suicide risk assessments was unusual.°°\n3o Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that it was not unusual for someone with static risk\nfactors like Epstein to have received multiple suicide risk assessments. According to the Chief Psychologist upon\nreviewing a draft of this report, what was unusual was the fact that Epstein was in atorney conference “day and night\non a daily basis due to his financial resources.” She noted that it was difficult for Psychology Department staff to\ninterview Epstein because he had a right to his atorney visits, which would last throughout the working day.\n\n49\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023424.jpg": "had left MCC New York.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations\nLieutenant from approximately lo p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August lo, told the OIG that she did not\nknou that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this\nissue. The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that\nEpstein needed a cellmate; houever, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant should have knoun of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the\nPsychology Department on July 3o, 2ol9, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an\nappropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email\nnotifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate\nand did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on\nAugust lo, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.\nThe Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not atended SHU training, but he\nhad worked in the SHU approximately lo to 2o times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he\nreported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nshift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and\nasked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said\nhe worked the 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him\nworking 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9 through l2 a.m. on August lo. After the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge left at lo p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the\nSHU from lo p.m. to l2 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting\nwith his atorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned\nto his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said\nthey left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if\nan inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he\nsaid he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological observation.\nTherefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with\nhim about that requirement. Thomas said the SHU staff should have notified the Operations Lieutenant as\nsoon as they knew that Epstein’s cellmate had departed MCC New York on August 9.

Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023473.jpg": "count.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having\nauthorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.\nThe OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving\nand Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the lo p.m. institutional count\nknouing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU.

They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023479.jpg": "MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological\nobservation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.\n\nA review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2ol9, revealed Epstein was alloued to leave the\nsuicide watch room to visit with his atorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023480.jpg": "6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death.

All housing units, excluding\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU), have access to unmonitored telephones\nwith a direct connection to the SDNY Federal Public Defenders’\nOffice. Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a\ndirect connection to the EDNY Federal Public Defenders’ Office.\nIf the inmate’s atorney cannot be contacted on the provided\ntelephones, the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff\nassistance in writing. The Unit Team staff will review the\nrequest, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit\nTeam’s unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an\nunmonitored atorney call, the inmate or the inmate’s atorney\nmust request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other\ncorrespondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.\nInmate requests for unmonitored atorney calls are carefully\nreviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected.\nFrequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate’s\nopportunity to pursue illegal activities without detection.\nAdditionally, staff time and atention is unfairly focused on the\nsingle inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at\nthe expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.\n\nPage lo of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23753", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023754.jpg": "An atorney may not call an inmate. Atorneys who need to speak\nwith an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call\nthem must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by\nleter. Similarly, atorneys may not fax documents to inmates\nor to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.\n2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)\nThe Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as\npart of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28\nC.F.R. §$54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassiqned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to Gisciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking\natorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored\ntelephone call as described above in section B{l).\nPage ll of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.jpg": "3 Emergency Telephone Calls\nInmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to 4a death\nor serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a\nrequest to the Religious Services Department. Likewise, if an\nindividual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they\nshould call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious\nServices Department.\nC. Legal Mail\nAll legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail\naddressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to\nsender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.\n\nl. Legal Mail Envelopes:\nThe Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may\nreceive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8; and\nBureau of Prisons Program Statement 58oo.lo, Mail Management\nManual (“PS 58oo.lo\"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides\nthat special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of\nthe inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately\nidentified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is\nmarked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\ninmate.’\" 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8(a). Houever, the presence of a\nreturn address with a firm name does not suffacientiy adentify\nthe sender of the material as an atorney.\n\nSpecifically, the atorney must be adequately\n\nidentified on the envelope as an atorney . . . The\n\nuse of the titie \"Esquire\" without additional\n\nindication of the sender's occupation does not\n\nestablish the bearer as an atorney or legal aid\n\nsupervisor. Mail from individuals using the title\n\n\"Esquire\" as the exclusive identification of their\n\nstatus shall not be handled as special mail, even if\n\nthe envelope contains some special mail markings.\nP.S. 58oo.l6, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handing of\nlegal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wil be\nenforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify\nlegai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's\nname) and their legal status (i.e., atorney), in the return\naddress portion of the envelope. This information, in addition\nto writing elsewhere on the envelope “Special Mail —- Open oniy\nin presence of inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated\nas confidential atorney-client communication.\n\nPage l2 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023760.jpg": "F. Administrative Remedy Program\nIt is imperative that inmates atempt to resolve any condition of\nconfinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate\nstaff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all\nhousing units have bulletin boards that have information\nexplaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,\netc.\nThe Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program is a process through\nwhich inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to\nvirtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures\nhave not resolved the mater. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -\nAdministrative Remedy; and Program Statement l33o.l3,\nAdministrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follous:\n{l} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of\nPrisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract\nResidential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally knoun as Community\nCorrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and\n(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their\nconfinement. See C.F.R. §542.lo.\nInmates are obligated to atempt informal resolution of\ngrievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative\nremedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l3. The deadline for completion of\ninformal resolution and submission of a formal writen\nAdministrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 2o\ncalendar days follouing the date on which the basis for the\nRequest occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.l4. Once an inmate has\nfiled a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the\nWarden of that facility has 2o calendar days to investigate and\nprovide the inmate a writen response. See 28 C.F.R. $542.l8.\nIf the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she\nhas 2o calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy\nAppeal (BP-lo). See 28 C.F.R. §542.l5. Once received in the\nRegional Office, the Regional Director has 3o calendar days toa\ninvestigate and provide the inmate a writen response. See 28\nC.F.LR. $542.l8. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional\nDirector’s response, he/she has 3o calendar days to file a\nCentral Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-ll). See 28\nC.FLR,. $l5.

After receiving the Administrator’s response, the\ninmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program.\nThe program provides for expedited investigations and responses\nin emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both\nfiling grievances and receiving responses.

See Program Statement l33o.l3, Sec.8{d) (l),\nAdministrative Remedy Program. If the Regional Administrative\nRemedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the\nrequest shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to.\nOtherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will\nbe advised in writing of that determination, without return of\nthe request. The inmate may then pursue the mater by submiting\na request for Administrative Remedy locally to the Warden. The\nWarden shall allou a reasonable extension of time for such a\nresubmission.

Inmate Designations\nThe majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates\nwho, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another\ninstitution. Houever, an inmate is not transported to a new\ninstitution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement and commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023952.jpg": "Epstein #763l8-o54 Medical/Mental Health Records\n\nFrom\n\nTo @steptoe.com\n\nDate 2ol9/o8/23 o9:l5\n\nSubject: Epstein #763l8-o54 Medical/Mental Health Records\n\nAtachments: TEXT-.htm, Certification of Identify Form.pdf\nGood morning\n| spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for releasing medical/psych\nrecords to defense counsel.

This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist.

Follou Up:\nStaff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant\nwhen they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation.

Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025122.jpg": "Page 76o\n\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a\nmember of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress\nregarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.\nPer guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with\nR&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and\nsuicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology\nServices Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting.

The case of Gaella vy.

Doe has been subpoenaed for deposition in this case by the Defendant\nJeffrey Epstein. The subpoena schedules the deposition for April 2, 2oo8.\nrs Y. Doe is a victim in this mater who alleges that she was sexually\nassaulted by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein when she was l6 years old. Y. Doe has brought a\ncivil case against Defendant Epstein captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v. Jeffrey Epstein, case\n. ' The witness is named here anonymously as “Y. Doe” because of the sensitive\nallegations of sex abuse upon a minor involved in this case.\no7/26/l7 Page 42 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031564.jpg": "- 3o5-93l22oo Herman &Mermelstein, P o4:24:o8 n,m. 3l-o3-2oo8 3/5\nno. o8-CV-8o232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for the Southern District\nof Florida. This civil case alleges sexual assault against Defendant Epstein.\n\n3. It is anticipated that Y. Doe will be questioned on the same facts and\nissues regarding her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein in both the civil and criminal cases.\n\n4. It would protect the victim from harassment, as well as undue and\nnecessary emotional stress and trauma, to have her deposition taken only once by\nDefendant Epstein, rather than requiring that she unnecessarily revisit the emotional and\ntraumatic facts in separate depositions for each case.\n\n5. It would not prejudice the defense in its investigation or preparation of this\ncase if the depositions in the civil case and the criminal case were conducted at the same\ntime.\n\n6. Florida Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 3.22o(l)(l) provides that the Court\nmay issue a protective order “as is appropriate to protect the witness from harassment, :\nunnecessary inconvenience, or invasion of privacy, including prohibiting the taking of the\ndeposition.” Further Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.22o(h)(l) contemplates that a witness in Y. Doe’s\ncircumstances will only be subject to one deposition: “In any case, no person shall be\ndeposed more than once except by consent of the parties or by order of the court issued\non good cause shoun.”\n\n(3 This Court has the inherent authority to protect witnesses in a criminal\ncase from potential emotional harm. State v. Ford, 626 So.2d l338 (Fla. l993); State v.\nTarrago, 8oo So.2d 3oo (Fla. 3d DCA 2ool). A requirement that a single deposition be\ntaken by Defendant Epstein for both the civil and criminal cases will avoid unnecessary\nemotional harm to Y. Doe.

But Goldberger said in a prepared\n\n| statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were\nnot charged because the Palm Beach County state atorney's office questioned the\n\n| credibility of the witnesses.\"\nThe statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.\nEpstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\"\nGoldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph\nexaminer, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage.

Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the\nindictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended\ntime periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and\n“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does\nnot identify the alleged victims by name.\n\nMaxwell’s first argument fails because the\nGovernment need only describe the time and place of\ncharged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti,\n5l3 F.2d at ll8. The details are subject to proof at\ntrial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on\nor about’ language used to describe the windou of\nwhen a violation occurred.” United States v.

A defendant seeking severance must shou\nsignificant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the\ncourt of conducting multiple trials. United States v.\nWalker, l42 F.3d lo3, llo (2d Cir. l998). The harm to\nthe defendant must be more than “solely the adverse\neffect of being tried for two crimes rather than one.”\nUnited States v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir.\nl98o). Though this standard is demanding, the Court\nconcludes that, due to unique features of the perjury\ncounts, Maxwell meets it here. Trying all counts\ntogether would compromise Maxwell’s right to the\ncounsel of her choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann\nAct counts would risk an unfair trial on each set of\ncounts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations\nof sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the\njury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the\njury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s\ncharged conduct. This presents a significant risk that\nthe jury will cumulate the evidence of the various\ncrimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\nseparately, it would not do so. See United States v.\nHalper, 59o F.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the\nevidence presented on the Mann Act counts may\nprejudice the jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s\ntruthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of the\nperjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooool42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000144.tif": "8la\nStates v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d lo64, lo7o-7l (2d Cir.\nl982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden\nseparate trials may impose on all trial participants.\nBut much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts\nand the Mann Act counts does not overlap. In\nparticular, materiality for statements made in a civil\ndeposition is broad, and evidence on that question is\nunlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross,\nl4 F.3d at 753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 US. at 5o9. Although\nsome allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to both\nsets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will\nexpand the scope of the trial far beyond the narrouer\nissues presented. And while the Court agrees with the\nGovernment that at least some of Maxwell’s concerns\nare overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action\nwill require a significant investment of time and\nresources to provide the requisite context.\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance.\n“Motions to sever are commited to the sound discretion of\nthe trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d\nll4l, ll49 (2d Cir. l989). In its discretion, the Court\nconcludes that trying the perjury counts separately\nwill best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all\ncharges in this case.\n\nVI.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023093.tif": "charges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023101.tif": "forward, that either there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with an indictment.\nThe September meeting did not alter or shift our position.” !°°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that after hearing the defense argument, Acosta reiterated that the\nfederal interest in the case could be vindicated only by a state plea to an offense that required\nsexual offender registration, resulted in a two-year term of incarceration, and was subject to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 process for providing compensation to the victims. When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to compromise on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023102.tif": "noted that the revised charges involved l9 victims, so the defense proposal for a l5-month sentence\namounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou ...a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, ““With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state correctional institution.”!°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,\nfew of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence\nindicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.\n\nlo4 Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.\nlo5 Oosterban told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement\nwith it.”\n64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23lo2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023115.tif": "everything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafatia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually acceptable agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. !*° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nl The standard <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we .. . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023116.tif": "l. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA\n“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender\nRegistration Requirement\n\nAfter having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included in a plea agreement,\nby the afternoon of September 2o, 2oo7, the defense rejected the federal plea option, and the parties\nresumed negotiations over the details of an NPA calling for Epstein to plead to only state charges.\nThrough multiple emails and atempts (some successful) to speak directly with Acosta and other\nsupervisors, defense atorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that Epstein plead to a\nstate charge requiring sexual offender registration.\n\nAfter receiving the federal plea agreement, Lefkouitz spoke with Villafafia. She reported\nto Acosta and Lourie that Lefkouitz told her the defense was “‘back to doing the state-charges-\nonly agreement” and wanted until the middle of the follouing week to work out the details, but\nthat she had told defense counsel that “we need a signed agreement by tomorrou [Friday] or we\nare [filing charges] on Tuesday.”\n\nLefkouitz emailed Villafafia about the draft NPA that she had sent to him, pointing out\nthat it called for a 2o-month jail sentence folloued by lo months of community control, rather than\nl8 months in jail and l2 under community control, and to ask if the USAO had “any flexibility”\non the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>. Villafafia responded:\n\nThe l8 and l2 has already been agreed to by our office, so that is\nnot a problem. On the issue about l8 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem to\nbe miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding\nthe girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also\npromising that they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.\n\nI reviewed the e-mail that I sent you on Sunday with the comments\non some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution\nagreement, the office may be more willing to be specific about not\npursuing charges against others. Houever, as I stated on Sunday,\nthe Office cannot and will not bind Immigration.\n\nAlso, your timetable will need to move up significantly. As [State\nAtorney] Barry [Krischer] said in our meeting last week, his office\ncan put together a plea agreement, [and an] information, and get you\nall before the [state] judge on a change of plea within a day.\n\nVillafafia alerted Krischer that evening that negotiations were “not going very well” and\nthat defense counsel “changed their minds again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not\nconcurrent state and federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach . . . an agreement, then I need to\n[charge] the case on Tuesday [September 25] and I will not budge from that date.”\n\nIn response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation with Lefkouitz about the defense\npreference for a “‘state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants to get out of\n[sexual offender] registration which we should not agree to.” Lourie emailed Acosta:\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023126.tif": "a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023127.tif": "that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span>. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” Ifa substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution.

Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose.

The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023212.tif": "The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023218.tif": "“T’m reconstructing memories of ... l2 years ago. I can speculate that at some point, the mater\ncame up, and I or someone else said . .. what would the original charges have likely brought? And\nsomeone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall who initially proposed this\nmethod, but he believed that it likely did not result from a single specific discussion but rather\nfrom conversations over a course of time. Acosta could not recall specifically with whom he had\nthese discussions, other than that it would have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafafia was\nnot asked for her views on a two-year sentence, and she had no input into the decision before it\nwas made. Villafafia told OPR that she examined the state statutes and could not validate that a\nstate charge would have resulted in a 24-month sentence. OPR also examined applicable state\nstatutes and the Florida sentencing guidelines, but could not confirm that Epstein was, in fact,\nfacing a potential two-year sentence under charges contemplated by the PBPD.\n\nOn the other hand, during his OPR interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” that “somehou the\ndefense conveyed . . . we’re going to trial if it’s more than two years.” Menchel similarly told\nOPR that he did not knou hou the two year sentence was derived, but “obviously it was a number\nthat the office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] would take” it. Sloman told OPR that he\nhad no idea hou the two-year sentence proposal was reached.\n\nThe contemporaneous documentary record, houever, provides no indication that Epstein’s\nteam proposed a two-year sentence of incarceration or initially suggested, before the USAO made\nits offer, that Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late as July 25, 2oo7—\nonly days before the USAO provided the term sheet to defense counsel—Epstein’s counsel\nsubmited a leter to the USAO arguing that the federal government should not prosecute Epstein\nat all. Furthermore, after the initial “term sheet” was presented and negotiations for the NPA\nprogressed, Epstein’s team continued to strongly press for less or no time in jail.\n\nThe USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious\nalternative to the two-year sentence proposal was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that\ncarried a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was facing a substantial sentence under\nthe federal sentencing guidelines, l68 to 2lo months’ imprisonment. Houever, it is unlikely that\nhe would have agreed to a plea that required a guidelines sentence, even one at the louer end of\nthe guidelines. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues had been concerned that Epstein\nwould opt to go to trial if charged and presented with the option of pleading to a guidelines\nsentence, and as previously discussed, there were both evidentiary and legal risks atendant upon\na trial in this case. If federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed\nby offering him a plea under Federal Rule of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Procedure</span> ll(c) for a stipulated sentence,\nwhich requires judicial approval. Acosta rejected this idea, houever, apparently because of a\nperception that the federal district courts in the Southern District of Florida did not view Rule ll(c)\npleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and thus limit the USAO’s options.\n\nAnother alternative was to offer Epstein a plea to conspiracy, a federal charge that carried\na maximum five-year sentence. Shortly after Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum\nto her supervisors, Lourie recommended to Acosta charging Epstein by criminal complaint and\noffering a plea to conspiracy “to make a plea atractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel\nhad already discussed a state-based resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafafia had considered\noffering Epstein a plea to one count of conspiracy and a substantive charge, to be served\nconcurrently with any sentence he might receive separately as a result of the state’s outstanding\n\nl8o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.tif": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023250.tif": "NPA.?!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2325o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023309.tif": "investigation.

Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the identified victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims identified in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 identified in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing.

For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing.

For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023336.tif": "signature on this Agreement; and\n\nIT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein’s background, that\nthe interest of the United States and Epstein’s oun interest and the interest of justice will be\nserved by the follouing <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span>;\n\nTHEREFORE, on the authority of R.

BOP policy\nrecognizes that “on rare occasion, during times of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone\ncall outside of the Inmate Telephone System. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a\nsecure area (e.g., a locked office),” and “must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff\nmember coordinating the call must notify the BOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the\ninmate’s name and register number, the date and time of the call, the number and name of the individual\ncalled, and the reason for the call. The Special Investigative Services must enter this information into the\ntelephone recording system within 7 days.\nb. Personal Effects, Medication, and Linens\nFederal regulations governing BOP SHUs provide that inmates in administrative detention status ordinarily\nmay have a reasonable amount of personal property.'° Under BOP policy regarding SHUs, the personal\nproperty of SHU inmates “may be limited or withheld for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping.”\"®\nThe BOP Chief Pharmacist issues medication each workday for inmates in the SHU. Restricted medications\nare administered to inmates during daily SHU rounds. Each institution determines “the medication(s) and\namount (number of days) an inmate in SHU may maintain in their cell.” Inmates may also purchase pre-\napproved over-the-counter medications at the commissary. MCC New York General Housing Units Post\nOrders provide that when an inmate is released or transferred out of a housing unit, the inmate will remove\nall limited and government-issued clothing from the cell in which the inmate was previously housed. These\nPost Orders further specify that all cells are to be cleaned daily by inmates occupying the cell, and that\nblankets, touels, and other linens will not be used as rugs or hung over inmate bunk beds at any time.\nPursuant to these Post Orders, MCC New York housing unit officers on all three shifts are responsible for\nmaintaining “a high level of sanitation” and a “safe and clean environment.”\n5 28 C.F.R. § 54l.3l (h)(l).\nl6 BOP Program Statement 527o.ll, Special Housing Units.\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2338o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.tif": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day.

The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys.

During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU.

The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\nunavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023413.tif": "concurred with her determination. Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein.

The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures.

Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The Northeast Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not knou why his signature was on the form\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23436", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023473.tif": "count.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having\nauthorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.\nThe OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving\nand Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the lo p.m. institutional count\nknouing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not\nrequired to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of\nthe Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.

The Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or <span class=\"highlight\">procedure</span> that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide prevention policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch. Additionally, the\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023479.tif": "MCC New York Procedural Memorandum for Psychological Observation states that inmates on psychological\nobservation will be continuously monitored by either an inmate companion or a staff member.\n\nA review of the Suicide Watch Chronological Logs for July 23, 2ol9, revealed Epstein was alloued to leave the\nsuicide watch room to visit with his atorneys for more than 6 hours. According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023486.tif": "individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.

See 28\nC.F.R. $54o.loo, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for\nInmate; and Program Statement 5264.o7, Telephone Regulations for\nInmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of\nMaintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an\ninmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a\nperson of his or her choice outside the institution on a\ntelephone provided for that purpose. Houever, limitations and\nconditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges\nto ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional\nINManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set\nforth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those\nlimitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure\nthe security or good order, including discipline, of the\ninstitution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate\ntelephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.\nSee 28 C.F.R. Part 54l.\nInmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on\ntheir approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers\nplaced on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits\nthe initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.\nInmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are\nassigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit\nTeam.\nInmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring\ncapability. See 28 C.F.R. $54o,lo2. A notice is posted next to\neach inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.\nOrdinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases\nthe receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §54o.lo5. Third party,\nconference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or\nother alternative call arrangements are not permited, thus\nlimiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for\ncriminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the\ntelephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which\nmay result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases\ncriminal charges.\nInmates may place atorneys on their approved telephone list.\nHouever, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such\ncalls are not atorney-client privileged calls.

The sentencing court\nmust first provide to the USMS the final presentence\ninvestigation report and a signed judgement ana commitment order.\nThe USMS must then forward these documents along with a request\nfor designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation\nCenter (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

The case of Gaella y.

There is :\nabsolutely no basis in the record to indicate that Epstein will act other than properly and with the |\nproper decorum at the depositions of the Plaintiffs and abide in all respects with the No-Contact |\nOrder. |\nWherefore, Epstein respectfully requests that this Court enter an order denying Plaintiffs’ |\n.

Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234"};
