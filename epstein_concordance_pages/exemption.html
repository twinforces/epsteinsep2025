There were a lot of\nproblems with their last atempt. They tried to re-open\nall the loopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent\nto Lefkouitz the draft NPA that she had provided to\nLefcourt on September ll, 2oo7, noting that it was the\n“last version” and would “avoid [him] having to\nreinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case\nagents on the status of negotiations, noting that she\nhad told her “chain of command... that we are still on\nfor the [September] 25th [to bring charges] ... , no\nmater what.”\n\nAfter receiving the draft NPA, Lefkouitz asked\nVillafafia to provide for his review a factual proffer for\na federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with\nrespect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f we go that route,\nwould you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecu-\ntion agreement public?” Villafafia replied that while a\nfederal plea agreement would be part of the court file\nand publicly accessible, the NPA “would not be made\npublic or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.
