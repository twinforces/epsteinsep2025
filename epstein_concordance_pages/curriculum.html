Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence.

As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l3 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l2\n\nC.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my <span class=\"highlight\">curriculum</span> vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL.

Examiner Flatley will explain that such registry software information includes\nseveral fields, including registered organization and registered ouner, which are user input data.\nHe is expected to explain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data\nAD Lab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that he examined\ncertain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and\n55. In particular, he is expected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails\non Government Exhibit 54; Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on\nGovernment Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify\nthat Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created under a user profile named “gmax.”\nHe is also expected to testify that Government Exhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on\nGovernment Exhibit 55. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed\non Government Exhibits 4l7, 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the\nmetadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content created date, date\nlast saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the\naccuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner\nFlatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the\nfile was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or\nembedded inside certain files, like Word documents.\n\nThe Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony\nreferenced in the September l5, 2o2l leter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr.\n643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, l4 Cr. l6o\n(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.\nHealey, ll Cr. l32 (SAS).\n\nAs noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the\nsort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on\nhis first-hand knouledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To\nthe extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes\nfamiliar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses specialized knouledge by virtue\nof his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,\nand is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is\ncharacterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 7o2, we note that his experience and\ntraining are described in his <span class=\"highlight\">curriculum</span> vitae, which was produced to you on September l5, 2o2l\nbearing Bates number 35o3-ool.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 76l _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page lo5 of 246 24oo\nLCGVMAX3 Loftus — direct\n\nl A.

Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her intention to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o357\n"};
