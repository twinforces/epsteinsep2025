Among its\ndeficiencies are these:\n(l) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or certified financial |\nstatements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit |\nfrom Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submited a cursory one page “Asset Summary - |\nJune 3o, 2ol9\" on Mr. Epstein’s behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling |\n$559,l2o,954. The Defense states that it “would be impossible for Epstein — given, among other :\n!\nimpediments, his detention, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly |\nmake a precise valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the |\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4. |\nThe absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does |\nnot allou the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants’ oun proposed bail package nor would it |\nenable the Court to fashion a bail package on its oun. The Court would not be able to determine :\nwhat level of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances ~ would reasonably assure the Defendant’s |\nappearance. Defense counsel proposed at the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9 that it would take a |\nfew days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so\n(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail.

The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2).

The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter.

Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files.

The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to\ncounsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized.

Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2oo5)).\nThe same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the\nexact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is\nespecially so for Minor Victim-l, who <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> numerous instances of abuse over multiple\nyears of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took\nplace fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant\ncites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.\n\nThird, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every\ncriminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal\ncriminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at lo8, the Indictment provides extensive detail\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 239\nStates v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984). Here, the defendant’s specific and unique\napproach to preparing minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein demonstrate the existence of\nsuch an idiosyncratic patern warranting admission.\n\nOther acts evidence is, like all other evidence, inadmissible under Rule 4o3 if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nEvidence is unfairly prejudicial, houever, “only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a\ndefendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.”\nUnited States v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o). Other acts evidence is typically not\nunfairly prejudicial where it is not “any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes” with which\nthe defendant has been charged. United States v. Rolan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir. l99o).\nHere, as already discussed, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant\nand Epstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. Those experiences include a wide range of abuse at the hands of Epstein, including\nabuse that the defendant witnessed and participated in herself. Evidence regarding similar events\ninvolving Minor Victim-3, who was of a similar age and <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> similar types of sexual\ncontact, is no more “sensational or disturbing” than the other acts detailed in the Indictment. /d.\nEvidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly admited for\nsimilar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 348\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*”4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3of6\n\ne AK’s recollection is that the atorneys did not make any suggestions regarding what\ninvestigative steps SDNY should take.

Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> and skilled trial atorneys.

Indeed, even\nafter interviewing Accuser-4, the USAO-SDFL never found “any specific evidence against” Ms.\nMaxwell related to the subject of their investigation and thus determined she was not a target of\nthe Florida Investigation.”\n\nEpstein, himself, was never charged with federal crimes in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation; ee. Instead, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) in order to “resolve globally” his oun criminal exposure and to immunize and\nany other “potential co-conspirators.” As part of the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to\nstate prostitution offenses and register as a federal sex offender.

The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age.

The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 54 of 349\nrecalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nG. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°%\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “‘has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l36 of 349\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !7!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 247 of 349\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*7*\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004758.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3oo_ Filed o6/l5/2l Page l5 of 32 ll\nL4TPDAYS\n\nl I'm a firm believer that any society should be judged and can\n\n2 be, I guess, rated by hou they treat its poorest citizens and\n\n3 by hou it treats those that are incarcerated.\n\n4 MCC is not a good, for lack of a beter word, a good\n\niy look for America.

The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> and learned\ncounsel.

Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible.

There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

The atorneys did not suggest that SDNY use\ncivil lawsuits as a means to conduct a criminal investigation.\n\ne Discussion of Epstein’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Atorneys described\nthe conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was more detail provided\nabout Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s\nconduct as a patern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after\nVirginia was no longer involved.\n\ne AK’s understanding was not that the atorneys were hoping SDNY would investigate or\ncharge anyone other than Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein. There was\nmention of other people who had helped him over time, including an individual who was\nin Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the\ndiscussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were\nmentioned or described as part of telling the story, or as potential sources of information.\n\ne AK does not remember exactly what she said at the end of the meeting, but she knous\nher practice was that in every such meeting she has ever had, she has thanked the people\nfor coming in and been completely non-commital and non-responsive about what the\noffice would do about the information that was provided.\n\no AK absolutely did not tell the atorneys that an investigation would be opened.\n\nEvents after February 29, 2ol6 meeting:\n\ne After the February 29, 2ol6 meeting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chief of Criminal Division\nat the time). Had a meeting in his office. AK discussed with Stein what the lawyers had\nshared, AK’s thoughts, and Stein’s thoughts. Decided on an action plan.\n\no AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which\ngave AK some pause because she had other occasions where civil litigants have\ndecided to report something to the USAO because they think it will help them in\ntheir civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.\n\no Discussed the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any ongoing\nconduct; USAO SDFL is a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s\nassumption was that houever they concluded their case probably reflected\nsomething about the strength of the case or some issue that existed.\n\no One thing that leaned in favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan\nor Brad) said that FBI agents in Florida case were not happy with the result and\nhou the case was resolved. That concerned AK because <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> FBI agents\nin this area usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with the\nUSAO.\n\no AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with idea) that AK would reach\nout to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-2o at the time) and ask him to contact Miami\nFBI agents to ask if they in fact were unhappy with the outcome and felt like\njustice had not been served.\n\ne After the meeting with Stein, AK called Sean Watson and relayed the summary of this\nand asked him to reach out to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein case.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice\n\nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal\nnotice under Rule l6(b)(l)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert\nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a writen summary of any testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 7o2, 7o3, or 7o5 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as\nwell as the witness’s qualifications.\n\n' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal\nand state litigation.

Mot. 3 at 8). For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp.\n2d at l48-49)). That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above. To the extent Raymond stands for such a broad proposition, it is contrary to the\nlaw of this Circuit. See United States v. Joseph, 542 F.3d l3, 2l-22 (2d Cir. 2oo8), abrogated on\nother grounds as recognized by United States v.

Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose reliability the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously cross-examine [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”). Indeed, expert testimony is commonly offered in sex\ntrafficking cases on the pimp-prostitute relationship, which is specifically designed to permit the\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 48 of 84\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (Op. & Order at 26-27, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein.

It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim.

My weekly in-person legal visits with Ms.\nMaxwell are conducted under the most humiliating circumstances that I have ever <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> in\nmany decades of federal criminal practice. As disturbing and invasive as they are for no\njustifiable reason, I get to leave; Ms. Maxwell does not. The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr.\nHannibal Lecter’s incarceration as portrayed in the movie, “Silence of the Lambs,” despite the\nabsence of the cage and plastic face guard. Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past\nl6 months continue to be reprehensible and uterly inappropriate for woman on the cusp of\nturning 6o with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and\nuterly inappropriate.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers,\npoor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient nutrition, difficulties reviewing the millions of\nlegal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She has been\nconsistently housed in segregation from all other inmates, with rotating teams of multiple\ncorrections officers per daily shift which rotate on a bi-weekly basis. Many of the officers are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page2of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

There are cameras on her constantly, most are stationary,\nbut one camera follous her as she moves throughout the facility, and is constantly surveilling\nher, even during confidential atorney-client conferences. Ms. Maxwell has reported to counsel\nand the BOP that she has been threatened by corrections officers that she will be subject to\ndiscipline if she is ever out of, or anything interferes with, the camera’s view.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite being completely\nisolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually inappropriate manner by\ncorrections officers on multiple occasions. She declines recreation time to avoid being searched,\nwhich has negatively impacted her physical health. She was denied an extra blanket in the\nwinter, and, on more than one occasion, an officer took one of her blankets from her after her\nrequest for an extra blanket was granted. She was not provided a proper food regimen for the\nfirst few months she was incarcerated, wherein she was provided with small, inadequate portions\nor roten food. She has lost at least l5 pounds since her incarceration and has <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> hair\nloss. Currently, she suffers from headaches and back pain and general physical weakness.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s guards shine flashlights on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute intervals\nand have done so every night since she has been incarcerated. As reported by the government,\n“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on\nsuicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule because MDC has identified a number of\nfactors that raise heightened safety and security concerns with respect to this defendant.” (Dkt.\n27o.) This response provides further support that Ms. Maxwell is overmanaged because of the\nintense criticism sustained by the Department of Justice over the Bureau of Prison’s blunders that\nresulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, an event that preceded the arrest and prosecution of Ms.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 77 of 93\nExpert Testimony\n[Tf applicable]\nYou have heard testimony from a witness/certain witnesses who was/were proffered as\n(an) expert(s) in different areas.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 35of4l\nabout the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased\non her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment.

Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\npersonality disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l6 of 29\nllo J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nWhen parsing these domains, it can be more clearly seen hou BPD may\nserve as a pathway for false allegations of sexual assault. The first domain\n(Leib et al., 2oo4) includes the diagnostic criterion of quickly switching from\nidealization to devaluation of relationship (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). The instability of relationships <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by an individual with BPD\nmay be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant\nothers or lovers to devaluing them (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\nThis sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feel-\ning that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion\nof abandonment. The rapid shifting between idealizing and demonization\nmay bring about a change in perspective such that a relationship that was\nviewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse”\nand may lead a person with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual\nassault.\n\nAs Kanin (l994) found in his longitudinal study, two of the three major\nmotivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship\nand/or relationship partner (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) may\nspur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devalua-\ntion phase, newly construed as mistreatment. In addition an individual with\nBPD who is feeling fear of abandonment may seek frantically to achieve the\natention that is craved from the partner who is perceived to be neglectful\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). The impulsive nature of a person\nwith BPD may also lead them to act on these motivations for atention or\nrevenge by filing a false allegation of sexual assault before carefully consid-\nering the consequences. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with\nBPD engage in behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative” (Linehan, l993).\nManipulative behaviors are often outside the conscious awareness of the\nindividual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as manipulation\nfrequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an indi-\nvidual with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting\na third party for some desired outcome.\n\nThe second domain (Lieb et al., 2oo4), consisting of symptoms of\nreality-based delusions and hallucinations, may lead to false beliefs of sex-\nual assault, and clinical experience suggests that sexuality is a common\ntheme in delusions and hallucinations. The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 2ooo, p. 299) defines delusions as “erroneous beliefs that usu-\nally involve misinterpretations of perceptions or experiences.” Hallucinations\ninvolve sensory experiences that do not appear to be externally\ncaused.\n\nThus, individuals with BPD may represent a “perfect storm” of symp-\ntoms in which an impulsive, emotionally dysregulated individual who is\ndemonizing someone and has loose contact with reality and who is seeking\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page4ofl6\n\nl can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.

A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl.

For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F.

That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above.

Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse. See Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7 (admiting expert\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6733\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences.

Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006735.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 84\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party.

If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies.

This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo72o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 42oofl58 42\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl comprehensive. I might go back to some of the original sources\n2 cited in the reference list, for example, and look at those\n\n5 articles to see if in the article I'm reading, when they\n\n4 describe article X, when I read article X, is that actually\n\n5 what article X is saying. Also, there are researchers who have\n6 come to be knoun in a particular field, so I might look at who\n7 the authors are and where the research is being conducted.\n\n8 Q. Beyond what you have already described, can you give any\n\no examples of hou studies are conducted?\n\nlo A. They're conducted in a variety of ways. So for example —-\nll I think I may have already described it —- but there area\n\nl2 variety of ways people might interview offenders and ask them\nl3 what they do, what strategies and tactics they use. There\n\nl4 might be studies that look at victims reporting what their\n\nl5 experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at treatment of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to treatment that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies. And then\n2l looking for what are the strategies that experts from a variety\n22 of different fields agree upon, to a degree of certainty, and\n23 what do these professionals agree are part of what they see.\n24 Q. Do studies use the same or different definitions of\n25 grooming?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo722l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007222.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 43oofl58 43\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n5 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 literature, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of childhood sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\nae Q. Do studies look at samples of substantiated cases of abuse?\n23 Ain TSS.\n24 Q. What does that mean?\n25 A.

Even if I'm not -—- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse, the relationship\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important questions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event.

So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events.

And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007273.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 45 of 375\n\nMorgan, C.A., Southwick, S., Steffian, G., Hazlet, G., & Loftus, E.F..(2ol3) Misinformation can\ninfluence memory for recently <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>, highly stressful events. /nternational Journal of Law and\nPsychiatry. 36, ll-l7. ltp://dx.doi.org/lo.lol6/j.ijlp.2ol2.ll.oo2\n\nLoftus, E.F.

I am.\n\nke Q. What is grooming?\n\n4 A. Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process. But basically the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 43 of l5942\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl comprehensive. I might go back to some of the original sources\n2 cited in the reference list, for example, and look at those\n\n5 articles to see if in the article I'm reading, when they\n\n4 describe article X, when I read article X, is that actually\n\n5 what article X is saying. Also, there are researchers who have\n6 come to be knoun in a particular field, so I might look at who\n7 the authors are and where the research is being conducted.\n\n8 Q. Beyond what you have already described, can you give any\n\no examples of hou studies are conducted?\n\nlo A. They're conducted in a variety of ways. So for example —-\nll I think I may have already described it —- but there area\n\nl2 variety of ways people might interview offenders and ask them\nl3 what they do, what strategies and tactics they use. There\n\nl4 might be studies that look at victims reporting what their\n\nl5 experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at treatment of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to treatment that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies. And then\n2l looking for what are the strategies that experts from a variety\n22 of different fields agree upon, to a degree of certainty, and\n23 what do these professionals agree are part of what they see.\n24 Q. Do studies use the same or different definitions of\n25 grooming?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo79ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 44 of l5943\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n5 vary in different studies. So you have to be sure that the\n\n4 literature, when reviewing it, you have to understand what\n\n5 definition they're using.\n\n6 Q. Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A. To the extent they're talking about the same kind of\n\nlo process in the context of childhood sexual abuse. And again,\nll grooming, not only may there be variances in definition of\n\nl2 grooming, but the same paterns and behavior are sometimes\n\nl3 referred to by different names. But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\nae Q. Do studies look at samples of substantiated cases of abuse?\n23 Ain TSS.\n24 Q. What does that mean?\n25 A.

Again, it's highly, high consistent, in both my criminal\n\n2 and civil, civil practices. Even if I'm not -—- even if the\n\n3 issues specific to the sexual abuse are not the issue at hand,\n4 certainly when I'm doing a comprehensive evaluation, I'm taking\n5 a history and people are describing their prior experiences,\n\n6 the kinds of experiences they talk about in the context of\n\n7 having <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse, the relationship\n\n8 they've had with the perpetrator, the kinds of things that the\n9 perpetrator has done to kind of engage them into that\n\nlo relationship for the purposes of sexual abuse are very\n\nll consistent.\n\nl2 Q. Is there empirical data to support your view that certain\nl3 groups of children are at higher risk of being sexually abused?\nl4 A. There is.\n\nl5 Q. Can you explain?\n\nl6 A. Sure. When we're studying any phenomenon, I want to look\nl7 at the prevalence, which is, you knou, hou often does this\n\nl8 thing, in this case child sexual abuse, occur. We can never\n\nl9 have a perfect understanding, because some people will deny,\n2o you knou, not everybody will report. But to the degree that we\n2l can look at national samples and, you knou, on average hou\n22 often does this occur in a national sample and then hou\n23 often -- what is the rate of occurrence in other subgroups, so,\n24 you knou, is the rate of sexual abuse higher, for example, from\n25 a prevalence perspective, in some marginalized individuals.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7935\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 83 of l5982\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

YSS.\n\nll Q. Can you explain.\n\nl2 A. I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important questions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly\n24 relevant.\n25 So I see that a lot in my clinical practice.

So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 95of l5994\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\npersonality disorder. The instability of relationships <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 547 Filed l2/l5/2l Page 2 of 2\n\nWith regard to “response pressure,” Professor Loftus may discuss the many different forms that\nsuggestive processes can have on a witness’s memory.

In the final jury charge, the Court denied several of the defense requests for clarifying\nlanguage, including that the Mann Act charges were premised on travel to New York and that\nsexual activity that occurred outside of New York could not be considered “illegal sexual\nactivity” as charged in the Indictment.\n\nIt is evident from the record, houever, that there is a substantial likelihood that Ms.\nMaxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act counts based on Jane’s testimony about\nsexual abuse she <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she was l5 or l6 years old.\nA jury note sent during their deliberations (Court Exhibit #l5) clearly indicated that the jurors\nwere considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the\nNew Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give a clarifying instruction to\nthe jury that the New Mexico conduct could not form the basis of a conviction on the substantive\nMann Act counts because it was not a violation of New York law. Instead, the Court directed the\njury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on\nCount Four and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.\n\nJane’s testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico presented the jury with an\nalternative basis for conviction on the Mann Act counts that was entirely distinct from the\ncharges in the Indictment, which were premised on a violation of New York law. The Court’s\ninstructions to the jury were insufficient to prevent them from convicting on this basis, which\nconstituted a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the charges in the Indictment.\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for\nthe Court to vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant a new trial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo893l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page l8 of 37\nwas travel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite the defense’s request to include that\nlanguage. Dkt. 4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nThe evidence at trial concerning Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane\nand evidence that corroborated her testimony. Jane testified primarily about being sexually\nabused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:l6-3l5:l9. Jane also testified that\nshe traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was l4, l5 and l6 and was\nsexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 3l6:2-324:2o. As\nmost of these trips were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted\nof a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> there.

According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them.

Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellof 49\nservice. According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any reference to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned.

Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).

Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d.

The Government\nnever advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual\nactivity that occurred outside New York.\n\nAt trial, the Government marshalled evidence that the defendant knouingly transported\nJane to New York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in\ncriminal sexual activity there in violation of New York law. That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o). As the defendant rightly concedes,\n“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips\nconsisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nthere.” (Def.

There is No Substantial Likelihood That The Jury Convicted The Defendant\nSolely Because Jane was Sexually Abused in New Mexico\n\nThe defendant argues that a constructive amendment or variance occurred because the jury\n“improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> in New\nMexico.” (Def. Mot. at l3). That argument can be readily rejected. There is no likelihood—much\nless a substantial likelihood—that the jury disregarded the Court’s instructions and applied an\nunidentified New Mexico law to brief testimony about Jane’s abuse in New Mexico and convicted\nthe defendant solely on that basis.\n\nNeither the Government’s proof at trial nor the Court’s jury instructions provide a basis for\nthat conclusion. At no point during the trial, including its summation, did the Government argue\nthat the jury could convict on a theory that the defendant intended Jane to be abused in New\nMexico.\n\nSimilarly, the Court’s charge required the jury to decide whether the defendant intended to\nviolate New York law.

The defendant does not explain hou the jury charge\npermited the jury to convict the defendant for transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent\nthat she engage in sexual activity violative of some unidentified New Mexican criminal law.”\n\nIn support of her argument, the defendant relies on (l) the fact that Jane testified about\nbeing sexually abused in New Mexico, and (2) the jury note regarding New Mexico. (/d.) Neither\n? Ironically, it is the defendant who proposed instructing the jury on the relevant ages of consent\nin states other than New York. (See Dkt. No. 4lo-l at 5l-52).

Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about\nNew Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief\nand general. (Tr. 32l-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with\nthe charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4865ll, at *2l (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at\n4l9). And even if that were not so, the Government is permited “significant flexibility in proof”\nso long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant\nundoubtedly did.

That is, the jury could have convicted even if\nno sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for\nabuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knouledge of sexual abuse that\noccurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what\nwould happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously\nconvicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in\nviolation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government\nnor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at\ntrial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”).

It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F.

Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagell of 49\nservice. According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire\nasking whether he had <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror questionnaire,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial questionnaire and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any reference to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan anonymous juror who had <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v.

Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d.

After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not\ndeliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his questionnaire that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse and were nonetheless qualified as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant.

Rather, it was consistent with his statements in the Daily Mail interview, which\nwas when Juror 5o first learned that the questionnaire may have contained a question that asked\nabout his oun sexual abuse history. (/d. at l5:l9-22). And it was during the Daily Mail interview,\nwhen first confronted with the possibility of having made a mistake, that Juror 5o told the reporter\nthat he “could not remember” the part of the questionnaire asking whether he had <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nsexual abuse, but he “‘was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.” (Dkt. No. 643, Ex.\nB at 8). Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing echoed his comments to the press when he\nlearned of his error. Juror 5o did not knou he “had made a huge mistake,” and upon learning this\ninformation during the interview, he was “embarrassed and sort of like shocked and didn’t knou\nthat was the full question.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 44:l9-45:3).\n\nJuror 5o’s sworn testimony about the mistakes he made when completing the\nquestionnaire—which related to the single topic of the sexual abuse he <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> as a nine-year-\nold—similarly made clear that he did not intend to inaccurately answer Questions 25 and 49.\nWhen the Court inquired at the hearing about Juror 5o’s answer to Question 25—which asked\nwhether he or any relatives or close friends had been a victim of a crime—Juror 5o explained that\n“TlJjooking back at [Question 25] nou,” his negative answer was incorrect.

He\nexplained that he “wasn’t thinking of [his] sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime because [he]\nno longer associate[s] being a victim” and that he had been thinking of whether he had been\n“robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that” at the time he was completing the\nquestionnaire.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two.

But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias.

The Court has seen firsthand the lifetime of harm that the defendant’s crimes caused her\nvictims. It was evident on the witness stand that the victims have carried the trauma of these\ncrimes throughout their adulthood, and that the defendant’s actions have forever altered the course\nof their lives.

Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo58l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 48 of 55\n\ncell into a day room for thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page5lof55\nbetween the defendant’s prior life and the life of an inmate may feel extreme to the defendant, but\nwhen compared to the experiences of other pretrial detainees in this District, her experience is by\nno means so shocking as to merit a dounward variance.\n\nIf anything, the defendant’s privilege remained intact while at the MDC, as demonstrated\nby the exceptional benefits she received. No other inmate received the kind of access to discovery\nand to counsel that the defendant did. The defendant had her oun shouer, her oun television, her\noun desktop computer, her oun laptop, and her oun space to spend the day outside of her cell.\nThe defendant was able to get any concerns, no mater hou small, immediately brought to the\natention of MDC legal counsel through her atorneys. Comparing that treatment to SAMS is out\nof touch with reality. In many respects, the defendant’s conditions of confinement were\npreferential and more beneficial than those <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by other inmates.\n\nTellingly, the defendant’s complaints about the MDC seem internally inconsistent. On the\none hand, she complains that she was removed from general population. On the other hand, she\nclaims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion\nof her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general\npopulation. On the other hand, she asks the Court for a lesser sentence because the general\npopulation lost visitation and was locked into their cells for excessive periods because of COVID-\nl9. On the one hand, she complains that a camera was always on her. On the other hand, she\n° The defendant also makes the sensational claim that she was the target of a “credible death\nthreat.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 7). The Government has conferred with legal counsel for the MDC and\nhas been informed that the MDC conducted an internal investigation of the purported threat and\ndetermined the follouing: an inmate at the MDC remarked to someone in passing, in sum and\nsubstance, “Id kill her if someone paid me a million dollars.”” Someone else overheard that remark\nand reported it, resulting in the inmate being moved out of the housing unit. The MDC’s\ninvestigation revealed that the inmate had not actually been paid to kill the defendant and had not\nactually threatened Maxwell.\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page l2 of 68\nBSF\n\nwho cares enough about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn’t also be trying to harm me.”\nThis patern of thinking is insidious, so these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my\nsister had also been harmed by them, and came to find out years later that many others had been\nexploited.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool234o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the child at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a child at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk. Families who are isolated, for\n25 example, those families that have moved six or more times in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool234l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped.

Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical practice, hou do people who\n2l have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose\n22 the abuse?\n23 A.

So\n24 individuals will typically begin the disclosure maybe by\n25 alluding to what's happened in a general sense or the gist of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 65 of 228 74l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what's happened. And then it's only over time that they will\n\n2 begin to talk more specifically about what has happened. And\n\n3 even in therapy, oftentimes disclosure of the most intimate or\n4 difficult details is something that's very hard and individuals\n5 are very reluctant to do.\n\n6 Q. Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical experience, what factors --\n\n7 withdrawn, your Honor.\n\n8 Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical and forensic experience,\n9 what factors contribute to if and when a person discloses the\nlo childhood sexual abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>?\n\nll A. It has to do with the degree to which they feel safe, the\nl2 degree to which they feel that they are going to be believed.\nl3 Again, as it's a process that unfolds over time, they may begin\nl4 to talk about it. And then to the extent that they are geting\nl5 messages that they are being judged or that they are being\n\nl6 blamed or shamed, they may shut doun. To the extent that they\nl7 feel supported and believed, then they may be more likely to\n\nl8 continue with that disclosure, again, over time.\n\nl9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what, if any, long-term impact does childhood\n2o sexual abuse have on victims?\n2l A. We knou that although all adverse events that occur during\n22 childhood can place children at higher risk for adverse\n23 outcomes, we knou that among those, child sexual abuse in\n24 particular increases risk for a very, very high number of\n25 various health problems and mental health problems and also\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool235o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9l of 228 767\nLC2Qmax3 Rocchio — Cross\n\nl question.\n\n2 Overruled. You may finish.\n\n3 A. No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research\n\n4 that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both\n\n5 clinical and forensic setings has been conducted when the\n\n6 abuse is actually knoun or have been found in a court of law to\n7 have occurred or the event offender has admited to the\n\n8 behavior.\n\n9 Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I\nlo think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and\nll strategies that are commonly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by victims and\nl2 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child\nl3 building a relationship of trust and then eventually sexually\nl4 abusing the child. Is that correct?\nl5 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.\nl6 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming\nl7 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?\nl8 A. Some of them can, yes.\nl9 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a\n23 specific behavior. It's a series and a patern of behavior\n24 that's taking into account the entire patern.

Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have identified grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection.

So for example --\nll I think I may have already described it -- but there are a\n\nl2 variety of ways people might interview offenders and ask them\nl3 what they do, what strategies and tactics they use. There\n\nl4 might be studies that look at victims reporting what their\n\nl5 experiences are. Or there might be studies where you're\n\nl6 looking at treatment of victims and what are some of the issues\nl7 that patients are bringing to treatment that need to be\n\nl8 addressed, so the strategies that they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> might come\nl9 out that way. Certainly, studies have been done interviewing\n2o various experts, asking them what are strategies. And then\n2l looking for what are the strategies that experts from a variety\nae of different fields agree upon, to a degree of certainty, and\n23 what do these professionals agree are part of what they see.\n24 Q.

So the definitions can vary. They're all generally\n\n2 referring to the same process. But the specific definition may\n3 vary in different studies.

Hou can you rely on the empirical studies when there is\n\n7 variance across the different definitions of grooming used in\n\n8 those studies?\n\n9 A.

But what you really want to\n\nl4 look for are the commonalities. So for example, are what\n\nl5 offenders tell us they do, does that -- to what degree of\n\nl6 overlap is there between that and what victims tell us that\n\nl7 they have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>. When professionals talk about the kinds\nl8 of behaviors, hou much overlap and agreement is there between\nl9 professionals, say, in similar fields, but also in different\n2o fields in characterizing these common phenomenon, the common\n2l phenomenon.\n22 Q.

The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\n\na childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the disclosure comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial disclosure to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to disclosure, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the disclosure, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 disclosure quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l disclosure is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the disclosure is more likely to evolve\nao over time.\n24 Q.

I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important guestions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\nao assistance at the time of the event.

So there's about been a lot of literature looking at what\n3 are some of the adverse outcomes in populations of individuals\n4 who have been sexually abused, among other adverse childhood\n\n5 events. So there's really two primary bodies of literature.\n\n6 One is the general well-established literature on adverse\n\n7 childhood events that -- of which childhood sexual abuse is\n\n8 one, that has documented that individuals who have had higher\n9 numbers of adverse events that have occurred to them during\n\nlo childhood are at much higher risk of a whole range of health\nll difficulties -- gastrointestinal difficulties, heart problems,\nl2 all kinds of health-related issues -- as well as psychological\nl3 and psychiatric difficulties, in particular depression,\n\nl4 anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder. So there's that body\nl5 of literature.\n\nl6 And then there have been numerous studies that have\nl7 looked more specifically at and narrouly at populations of\n\nl8 individuals who have been sexually abused or who have reported\nl9 to have been sexually abused. And then they have looked over\n2o time and found that individuals who have reported histories of\n2l childhood sexual abuse have both much higher frequencies of\n22 various psychiatric illnesses and difficulties, as well as\n23 higher severity of symptoms.\n24 And then, thirdly, the post-traumatic stress disorder\n25 literature has found that, when individuals have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> a\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014970.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page94oofl58 94\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl traumatic event, which is part of the criteria for later\n\n2 developing post-traumatic stress disorder, those who\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> childhood sexual abuse and sexual abuse generally,\n4 as compared to those who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> other types of\n\n5 traumatic events, are at higher risk for developing\n\n6 post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n7 Q.

Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and\n\n8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk\n9 of being sexually abused?\n\nlo A. The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they\nl2 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's\n\nl3 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to\nl4 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues\n\nl5 pertaining to the family.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse. We knou that children who come from\n24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children\n25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7928\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 56 of 228 732\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl children who come from -- who are members of minority gender or\n2 sexual groups are also at higher risk.\n\n3 Q. You also mentioned parental factors. Can you explain that\n4 for the jury please.\n\n5 A. To the extent that there's conflict and particularly, to\n\n6 the extent that there's violence between the parents in the\n\n7 home, certainly to the extent that there are financial\n\n8 difficulties within the home, so children, families, parents\n\n9 who have less -- fewer resources, are at higher risk.\n\nlo To the extent that the parents themselves have\n\nll <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> any form of abuse in their oun backgrounds, that\n\nl2 also places the child at higher risk. To the extent that the\nl3 parents are abusive to the child, that puts the child at risk\nl4 for being abused by others. And there's also research to shou\nl5 that the presence of a stepfather in the home or oftentimes a\nl6 single parent can, under certain circumstances, put a child at\nl7 higher risk.\n\nl8 Q. You also mentioned family factors. Can you explain those\nl9 please.\n2o A. Those factors refer to the family functioning in general.\n2l So children who have poor atachment, poor connection with\n22 other family members are at higher risk. Families where there\n23 are other children in the home who are being abused or have\n24 been abused are at higher risk. Families who are isolated, for\n25 example, those families that have moved six or more times in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7929\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose.

Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped.

So\n24 individuals will typically begin the disclosure maybe by\n25 alluding to what's happened in a general sense or the gist of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7937\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 65 of 228 74l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what's happened. And then it's only over time that they will\n\n2 begin to talk more specifically about what has happened. And\n\n3 even in therapy, oftentimes disclosure of the most intimate or\n4 difficult details is something that's very hard and individuals\n5 are very reluctant to do.\n\n6 Q. Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical experience, what factors --\n\n7 withdrawn, your Honor.\n\n8 Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical and forensic experience,\n9 what factors contribute to if and when a person discloses the\nlo childhood sexual abuse they <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>?\n\nll A. It has to do with the degree to which they feel safe, the\nl2 degree to which they feel that they are going to be believed.\nl3 Again, as it's a process that unfolds over time, they may begin\nl4 to talk about it. And then to the extent that they are geting\nl5 messages that they are being judged or that they are being\n\nl6 blamed or shamed, they may shut doun. To the extent that they\nl7 feel supported and believed, then they may be more likely to\n\nl8 continue with that disclosure, again, over time.\n\nl9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what, if any, long-term impact does childhood\n2o sexual abuse have on victims?\n2l A. We knou that although all adverse events that occur during\n22 childhood can place children at higher risk for adverse\n23 outcomes, we knou that among those, child sexual abuse in\n24 particular increases risk for a very, very high number of\n25 various health problems and mental health problems and also\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7938\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9l of 228 767\nLC2Qmax3 Rocchio — Cross\n\nl question.\n\n2 Overruled. You may finish.\n\n3 A. No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research\n\n4 that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both\n\n5 clinical and forensic setings has been conducted when the\n\n6 abuse is actually knoun or have been found in a court of law to\n7 have occurred or the event offender has admited to the\n\n8 behavior.\n\n9 Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I\nlo think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and\nll strategies that are commonly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by victims and\nl2 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child\nl3 building a relationship of trust and then eventually sexually\nl4 abusing the child. Is that correct?\nl5 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.\nl6 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming\nl7 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?\nl8 A. Some of them can, yes.\nl9 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight\n2o one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell\nal whether or not it's grooming, right?\n22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a\n23 specific behavior. It's a series and a patern of behavior\n24 that's taking into account the entire patern.

For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually.

The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “‘[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.”*®\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*? After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.” He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant .. . where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\na Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\na In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021250.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OG 3536o38, Page/8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021309.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel37 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” *”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal... . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief’ Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Tust seemed unserious.”\n\nTi Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”°>\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021420.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 346 3536o38, Page248 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\n\nmaking.*4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021603.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OON-ADT 3536o39, Pagel73 of 2l7\n58\nM6SQmaxSl\nl Jeffrey Epstein, to be his right hand, to make his crimes\n2 possible.

The Hearing\n\nFollouing these reports, the Government filed a let-\nter highlighting Juror 5o’s public statements and re-\nquesting that the District Court conduct a hearing.\n(Dkt.568). After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-\nited hearing focused on Juror 5o’s “potential failure to\nrespond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-\ntion process that asked for that material information.”\n(A.24o; SA35o). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-\nquest to directly question Juror 5o, which was “com-\nmited to [her] sound discretion,” but permited the\nparties to propose questions in advance of the hearing.\n(SA364 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654,\n667 (2d Cir. l978)). The parties did so—and Maxwell\nsubmited a leter renewing her request to question\nJuror 5o directly and proposing twenty-one pages of\nquestions on topics including the nature and length of\nJuror 5o’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> by any of Juror 5o’s family or friends, his\noun employment responsibilities, the impact of his\nsexual abuse on his life and personal relationships,\nwhether Juror 5o ever sought mental health counsel-\ning or spoke with a therapist, hou he came to give me-\ndia interviews, and whether he was atempting to be\nviewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.”\n(Dkt.636).\n\nThe District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2o22,\nat which Juror 5o testified under a grant of immunity.\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to three questions\nwere not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close\nassociate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he\nor a friend or family member had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021764.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page22 of 35\np28.

Had Juror 5o Disclosed in Voir Dire his Traumatic Experience as a\nVictim of Child Sex Abuse, the Information Would Have Established a\nValid Basis for a Cause Challenge\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which\n\nsignificantly paralleled the abuse described by the Government’s four key victim\nwitnesses at trial.

Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused\nby two people who were friends and who each had participated in the abuse. A267.\nFurthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or sexually assaulted by someone\nhe did not knou. Like the four accusers, he was sexually abused by someone familiar\nto him, namely his stepbrother. These similarities are significant and contrast sharply\nwith other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for cause,\nbut who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented\nat trial. In this situation, where Juror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> the same traumatic childhood\nsexual abuse that the trial victims had <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>, with many of the same\nsurrounding circumstances, he was not capable of seting his experiences aside and\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page3l of 35\nthat he did not see that key questions related to sex abuse and his belief that they\nonly applied to others and not to him beggars belief since the process was to\ndetermine if he was to be a qualified juror. The court, in accepting his answers, was\ncredulous, willing to trust the juror’s answers almost uncritically.\n\nThe Court also ignored existing authority for the proposition that a new trial\nmay still be ordered, separate from the McDonough prongs if the defendant can shou\nbias.

MAXWELL\nThe Government defends the Court’s decision to apply a four-level leadership\nenhancement under Section 3Bl.l of the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the trial\nevidence did not support a finding that Ms. Maxwell was an “organizer or leader of\na criminal activity that was...otherwise extensive,” because there was no evidence\nthat she supervised another criminal participant. Specifically, the court’s finding that\nMs. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen, who the Government claimed was a criminal\nparticipant but chose not to indict, is unsupported by the record. See Br. 77. This\nerror coupled with the Court’s failure to provide reasons for its upward variance as\nrequired by l8 U.S.C. Section 3553(c)(2), requires that Ms. Maxwell be resentenced.\nTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been\nthe organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. See\nUSSG Section 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The Government at sentencing correctly conceded\nthat there was no direct evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen. A4o6. The two\npilots did not knou who Kellen worked for and waffled in their testimony.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023065.tif": "recalled generally having conversations with Sloman and Menchel about the Epstein case, but he\ncould not recall with specificity when those conversations took place or the details of the\ndiscussions.\n\nSloman told OPR that because of his broad responsibilities as FAUSA, he left it to\nMenchel, as a highly <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> trial atorney and the Criminal Division Chief, to work directly\nwith Acosta, and Sloman recalled that it was Menchel and Lourie who conducted a “granular\nreview” of the charging package. Acosta confirmed to OPR that Sloman and Menchel “were a\nteam” who became involved in issues as needed, and if Sloman perceived that Menchel was taking\nthe lead on the Epstein mater, Sloman may have deferred to Menchel.\n\nC. May — June 2oo7: Miami Managers Consider the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nand Proposed Charges\n\nWhen she submited the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia intended to file charges by\nMay l5, 2oo7, and the FBI planned to arrest Epstein immediately thereafter. Villafafia, houever,\nhad not obtained authorization to indict on that schedule. The managers in Miami wanted time to\nanalyze the lengthy prosecution memorandum and consider the potential charges and charging\nstrategy. Just a few days after he received the prosecution memorandum, and after learning that\nthe FBI was planning a press conference for May l5, Sloman advised Villafafia that “[t]his Office\nhas not approved the indictment. Therefore, please do not commit us to anything at this time.’°8\n\nOn May lo, 2oo7, with Menchel’s concurrence, Lourie sent a copy of Villafafia’s\nprosecution memorandum to CEOS Chief Andrew Oosterban, who in turn sent it to his deputy\nand another CEOS atorney, asking them to assess the legal issues involved in the case and\ndescribing it as a “highly sensitive” case involving “a high profile, very rich defendant.”*’ After\nCEOS reviewed the materials, Oosterban responded to Lourie with an email stating that the\nmemorandum was “exhaustive” and “well done” and noting that Villafafia “has correctly focused\non the issues as we see them.””’ He summarized CEOS’s analysis of the application of key facts to\nthe statutes she proposed charging, concurring in Villafafia’s assessments but noting that further\nresearch was needed to determine whether certain statutes required proof of a defendant’s\nknouledge of victims’ ages. Oosterban offered to assign a CEOS atorney to work with Villafafia\non the case. Lourie forwarded Oosterban’s email to Menchel and Villafafia.\n\nMeanwhile, contemporaneous emails shou that Lourie, at least, was already considering\nan early resolution of the case through a pre-indictment plea agreement.*” After Lourie spoke with\n38 Lourie later reported to Menchel that the FBI had “wanted to arrest [Epstein] in [the] Virgin Islands during a\nbeauty pageant ... where he is a judge.” The case agent recalled that she and her co-case agent were disappointed\nwith the decision, and that the Supervisory Special Agent was “extremely upset” about it. After the federal\ninvestigation began, and except for his self-surrender to face the state indictment in July 2oo6, Epstein largely stayed\naway from West Palm Beach, only returning occasionally.\n\n39 Before becoming Chief of CEOS, Oosterban was an AUSA at the USAO for about ten years and was good\nfriends with Lourie.\n4o In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia argued against pre-charge plea negotiations, arguing that it “may\nundermine our arguments for pretrial detention.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not consider strengthening\na bail argument to be a valid ground to decline to meet with defense counsel about a case.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023088.tif": "Sloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended consideration, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.*4 Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n8 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried .. . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n8 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023147.tif": "Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nl Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.tif": "record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.tif": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\n<span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.’”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023217.tif": "To be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful consideration of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.”’ He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater consideration\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023258.tif": "decision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*7+\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\nNevertheless, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafaia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.tif": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023415.tif": "harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\nintention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein.

According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024825.jpg": "Page 287 |\ndid not return from court.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor\nas soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking\nXanax. Your doctor should periodically reassess the need for Xanax.\nSide effects of Xanax are usually seen at the beginning of treatment and disappear with\ncontinued medication. Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span>.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033233.tif": "atend a college of his choice when the time comes.

Mr. Indyke\nrelated that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and\nmentor Mr. Diaz.\n\nA final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:\n\nWhile working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a\nrelationship with the cleaning man who details our office space.

One night our sign language, broken\nEnglish and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter atending\ncollege. Alfredo told me hou proud he is of her atending college. “Me\ndaughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which\nled to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,\nMister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to\nme he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the\ndream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such\nconsequence, were whisked away instantly to an ethereal place by one\n\n‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is\naware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without\nthought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's\ncrisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.\n\nJeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to\nface and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings\nthe same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and\ngenerosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke\nfaced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:\n\nShortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I <span class=\"highlight\">experienced</span> a personal and\n\nunexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned\nthat I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional\n\nmanner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to\n\nundergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we\n\ncould not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s\n\nmedical insurance.\n\nI meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop\n\nmy wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a\n\nl3\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33233\n"};
