Ghislaine was no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these\nvalues. For example, I think it is no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot,\nan Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),submersible pilot and more, as they all\nrequire dedication, concentration and quick thinking and reactions and no small\namount of courage.\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple\ncompanies andorganizations which created products and services, as well as\nemployment. An important example is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong\npassion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission\nto create a \"global ocean community” based on the idea of shared ounership and\nresponsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or international waters.\n\nExhibit D.\n\nHer brothers, Jan and Kevin Maxwell, confirm the support Ghislaine has provided to\n\nothers:\nMy sister is Aunt to l3 nieces and nephews (nou aged l8 to 37) and I have\nwitnessed at first hand over the years her generosity to them — be it paying their\nschool fees, mentoring them and they grew up or providing job opportunities for\nthem. She also has an enduring capacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability\nto convert those feelings into action when required to help those less fortunate than\nherself. She had discreetly supported some friends financially and others by\nproviding a roof over their heads when they were doun on their luck, often for\nweeks at a time.\n\nExhibit E.\nGhislaine is an intelligent, warm hearted, generous, kind, funny, thoughtful and\nloving person. She cares about others. Ghislaine's first reaction on hearing of a\nproblem is hou tosolve it or hou to contribute to a solution. Her desire is always\nto engage, to bring energy toevery problem and to help.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo462", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 49 of 77\nGhislaine is educated and hard-working. She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be associated\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic <span class=\"highlight\">creativity</span>, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015214.jpg": "American Academy of Arts & Sciences, elected Fellou, 2oo3\n\nNational Academy of Sciences, elected 2oo4.\n\nGrawemeyer Prize in Psychology (for “Outstanding Ideas in the Science of Psychology”), 2oo5\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Corresponding Fellou (Scotland’s National Academy of Science & Leters,\nEst l783). 2oo5\n\nDistinguished Member of Psi Chi (The National Honor Society in Psychology), 2oo5\n\nLauds & Laurels, Faculty Achievement Award, University of California- Irvine, (for “great professional\nprominence in their field” in research, teaching and public service; 9\" recipient in UCI history), 2oo5\n\nIreland Distinguished Visiting Scholar Prize, 2oo6\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society (U.S. oldest learned society, Est. l745 by Benjamin Franklin), 2oo6\n\nInternational Academy of Humanism, elected Humanist Laureate, 2oo7 (for “outstanding contributions to\nscience, law, and academic freedom, and to the public understanding of the human mind”’)\n\nMcGovern Award Lecture, “honors outstanding behavioral scientists from around the world.” American\nAssoc. for the Advancement of Science, 2oo9\n\nDistinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law, American Psychology-Law Society, 2oo9.\n\nJoseph Priestley Award (for ‘achievement in the sciences’), Dickinson College, October, 2oo9.\n\nHouard Crosby Warren Medal, Society of Experimental Psychologists — Est. l9o4, (for “‘significant\ncontributions to the understanding of the phenomenology of human memory, especially its fragility and\nvulnerability to distortion”) 2olo\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility\n(for \"the profound impact that your pioneering research on human memory has had on the\nadministration of justice in the United States and abroad.\"), for year 2olo, ceremony Feb, 2oll\n\nForensic Mental Health Assn of California, William T.
