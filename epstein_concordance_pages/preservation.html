So the timing for a pretrial detainee to\n2l commit suicide on August lo, when his bail pending appeal\n22 motion is being filed on August l2, strikes us as implausible.\n23 Second, we had an independent doctor who was present\n24 at the autopsy which occurred on August ll.

See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Prior to the issuance of that\nOpinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2)\nsuperseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count. The\nCourt did not address the new charges in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. On May 25,\n2o2l, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the S2 indictment in\nwhole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293. For appeal <span class=\"highlight\">preservation</span> purposes\nor otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the\nCourt in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order.

The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for <span class=\"highlight\">preservation</span> for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page loof l4\nrefrain from wrongful conduct. Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l). (See, e.g., Commercial Standard\nTitle Co. v. Superior Court (l979) 92 Cal.App.3d 934, 945 [l55 Cal.Rptr.393].)\nLawyer-client confidentiality encompasses the lawyer-client privilege, the work-product\ndoctrine and ethical standards of confidentiality\n[2] The principle of lawyer-client confidentiality applies to information a lawyer\nacquires by virtue of the representation, whatever its source, and encompasses maters\ncommunicated in confidence by the client, and therefore protected by the lawyer-client\nprivilege, maters protected by the work product doctrine, and maters protected under\nethical standards of confidentiality, all as established in law, rule and policy. (See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the <span class=\"highlight\">preservation</span> of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page /7 of l97 2548\nLCFCmaxl\n\nl There was no way that documents could be shoun to him without\n2 turning off all the equipment and depriving the public of\n\n3 viewing him while he looks at certain things.

The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn April l6, 2o2l, the Court issued an Opinion & Order granting in part and denying in\npart Ghislaine Maxwell’s various pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the\nGovernment’s (Sl) superseding indictment and compel discovery. Prior to the issuance of that\nOpinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2)\nsuperseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count. The\nCourt did not address the new charges in the April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. On May 25,\n2o2l, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the $2 indictment in\nwhole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293. For appeal <span class=\"highlight\">preservation</span> purposes\nor otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the\nCourt in its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. To the extent new arguments are made, they are\naddressed belou. All pending motions are DENIED. The Court provides a brief summary of its\nconclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follou:\n\n° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey\nEpstein’s non-prosecution agreement. The Court again concludes, as it did in its April\nl6, 2o2l Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Atorney\nfor the Southern District of New York.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021534.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO 358 3536o39, Pagelo4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page lo of 2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o. And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 5o’s description of his social\nmedia accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” Jd. The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for <span class=\"highlight\">preservation</span> for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l534", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.
