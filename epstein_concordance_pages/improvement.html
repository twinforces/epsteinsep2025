There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al. (2ol2) describe the importance for young people of\n. containing the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality follouing\n‘An adaptive strategy disclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person\non the part of the to contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”).

STERNHEIA\\\n\nAs the government states, a flashlight is pointed at the ceiling of her isolation cell every\nl5 minutes, from approximately 9:3o pm to 6:3o am. It is hard to verbally convey the pouer of a\nlight that bounces off a concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot concrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s\neyes, disrupting her sleep and ability to have any restful night. The atenuating effects of sleep\ndeprivation are well documented.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be at the mercy of a revolving group of security officers who\nare used to guarding hundreds of inmates but nou focus their undivided atention exclusively on\none respectful, middle-aged female pretrial detainee. Recently, out of view of the security\ncamera, Ms. Maxwell was placed in her isolation cell and physically abused during a pat doun\nsearch. When she asked that the camera be used to capture the occurrence, a guard replied “no.”\nWhen Ms. Maxwell recoiled in pain and when she said she would report the mistreatment, she\nwas threatened with disciplinary action. Within a week and while the same team was in charge,\nMs. Maxwell was the subject of further retaliation for reporting the abuse: a guard ordered Ms.\nMaxwell into a shouer to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s\nrequest to have the camera record the guard alone with her in the confined space was again\ndenied.\n\nMs. Maxwell spends an increasing amount of time in her isolation cell because her daily\nremoval is delayed. Her movement within that cell is restricted. Despite claims by MDC Legal\nto the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from standing in certain areas of her six-by-nine-foot\ncell: she is not alloued to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in either corner of the isolation\ncell, and within two feet from the door. This directive encroaches on an already restricted and\nconfined area and limits her movement and use to the litle space that remains.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to have serious problems with the food provided to her. She has\nrepeatedly not been provided some or all parts of a meal. For the duration of her detention, she\nhas never received a properly heated meal. Her food, contained in plastic specifically contra-\nindicated for use in a microuave, is designed to be heated in a thermal oven. The old microuave\noven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost the food or disintegrates it and melts\nthe plastic container, rendering the food inedible. While guards finally acknouledged serious\nproblems with the food, they continued to microuave Ms. Maxwell’s food, rendering the food\ninedible and dangerous for consumption and leaving Ms. Maxwell with no meal and no\nreplacement. Late last week, guards informed Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be\nheated in a thermal oven, like that of all other inmates. While this may be an <span class=\"highlight\">improvement</span>, it\ndoes litle to correct seven months of deprivation impacting her nutrition and detrimental to her\nhealth.\n\nRecently there have been problems with odorous and non-palatable tap water. The water\nin the isolation cell was clouded with heavy particulates; the water in the day room was broun.\nRequests by Ms. Maxwell and counsel to provide her botled water or permit her to purchase\nwater were denied. In addition, her legal mail does not arrive in a timely manner, daily\nnewspapers arrive up to six weeks late, her emails have been prematurely deleted from the BOP\nsystem, and she has arrived late for VTC calls.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020482.jpg": "Cas@82o4e-oo28oDRINmBocintent 69o 2Filed Gel29/2a2ageage 6 of 8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\nSheet 3A — Supervised Release\nJudgment—Page a a of oO.\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSTANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION\n\nAs part of your supervised release, you must comply with the follouing standard conditions of supervision.

This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which\n9\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33229"};
