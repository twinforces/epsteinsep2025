We see no reason\nto depart from our reasoning in Weingarten. Accordingly, the question\npresented here is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual\nabuse of a minor for the purposes of § 3283 based on the facts of the\ncase. Jane, one of the women who testified at trial, gave evidence that\nshe had been sexually abused when transported across state lines as a\nminor.

We properly reasoned in Weingarten that § 3283 met none of\nthe conditions listed by Taylor that might require application of the categorical approach.\nSee Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. First, “[t]he language of § 3283[] ... reaches beyond the\noffense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense.” Id. at 59-6o.

Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims identified in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000315.jpg": "Case 9:o8 a6 b 236K ANH OB ceiRentBegumephfered driled SH DeeRet d7as/adief Ibage ll of\n2o\nProsecution Agreement] barred prosecution of the federal sexual offenses that Epstein had\ncommited against Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2....”).'° That is simply not so.\n\nContrary to Petitioners’ contentions, there has been no disposition by the government of\nany federal criminal charges against Epstein.

The Non-\nProsecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal\ncharges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal\ncriminal charges against Epstein.

The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v.

Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F.

That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000871.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRNG6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”.

To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

First, the Ministry’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French nationality, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4.

In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v.

Walker, l9l F.3d 326, 336 (2d Cir. l999)); United States v. Williams,\n2o5 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We reject Williams’s assertion that the evidence of innocent\ntravel was necessary to rebut the government's allegation that Williams had been involved in other\ncocaine importations from Jamaica. Although the government did argue that Williams had been\ninvolved in other importations, it did not allege that Williams had engaged in drug activity during\nthese particular trips.”); United States v. Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v.

To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985). Annabi supports dismissal here by\nconfirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the\nunderlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are\nso bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL\nwould conflict with the likely <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should\napply in case of any such conflict.\n\nThird, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only\nprosecutions for (i) conduct between 2ool and 2oo7 and (i) statutory offenses specifically\nreferenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision\ncontains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it\nwere ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.\n\nIn the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’\nintent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue.

The Government is required to observe high\nstandards of integrity and honorable conduct, and the supervisory pouer of the court is designed\nto insure that such standards are observed.”). Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Vaval, 4o4 F.3d l44, l52 (2d Cir. 2oo5)). “Because such agreements involve\nwaivers of fundamental constitutional rights, “prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\nperformance.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (quoting Vaval, 4o4 F.3d at l53). Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise\nmade by one atorney must be atributed . . . to the Government.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l9o\n(quoting Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54 (l972)).\n\nThe government’s atempt to evade the NPA flies in the face of these time-honored, and\nhonorable, principles. Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

The\nSecond Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply that “[a] plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThus, not only is Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly\nrecognizes that plea agreements can be binding in other jurisdictions, and that a plea agreement\nthat has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA does here—will be\nenforced according to its terms. The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that\nAnnabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA outside the SDFL, it is in conflict\nwith the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.\n\na. There is an “affirmative appearance” that the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDFL.\n\nThe “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need not be an express\nstatement.” United States v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). Here, the “affirmative\nappearance” that a broader restriction was intended is evident within the four corners of the\nNPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a whole. As noted above, the absence of any limiting\nlanguage in the co-conspirator immunity provision stands in sharp contrast to the NPA’s\nprovision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which is expressly limited to prosecution “in\nthis District.” NPA at 2. It is difficult to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” than the\nexpress inclusion elsewhere in the agreement of a limitation that is conspicuously absent here.\n\nBasic principles of contract <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> require an inference that the parties considered\nthe inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 28 of 38\ndefendant’s plea agreement explicitly stated that it “is binding on the United States only in [the\nEastern] district”), aff'd, 774 F.2d 3o (2d Cir. l985). Because there is no such language in the\nNPA here, Ms. Maxwell’s position is entirely consistent with these cases, and they counsel in\nfavor of enforcement of the NPA in this case.\n\nOther Second Circuit cases citing Annabi also support Ms. Maxwell’s position. In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2), the defendants\nrelied solely on their “subjective beliefs” and “implicit understanding” that they would not be\nprosecuted further in another district, which the court held irrelevant; they cited no “affirmative\nappearance” in support of their position, as Ms. Maxwell has. And in Russo, the court found it\nunnecessary to reach Annabi, but acknouledged that an “affirmative appearance” of an intent to\nbind other USAOs can be found even where a plea agreement does not contain an express\nstatement to that effect—an <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> that supports Ms. Maxwell’s position that the NPA\nbinds the government here. Russo, 8ol F.2d at 626.\n\nc. To the extent that Annabi conflicts with Eleventh Circuit law,\nEleventh Circuit law applies and would require enforcement of the\nNPA here.\n\nUnder federal choice-of-law rules, which apply in non-diversity cases, factors in\ndetermining which jurisdiction’s contract law applies include (i) any choice-of-law provision in\nthe contract; (ll) the place where the contract was negotiated, issued, and signed; (ili) the place of\nperformance; (iv) the location of the subject mater of the contract; and (v) the domicile,\nresidence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties. Advani\nEnters., Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyds, l4o F.3d l57, l62 (2d Cir. l998).

The later investigation, in turn, encompasses not only “offenses”\nfrom the 2ool-o7 time period, but also “Epstein’s background.” /d. at l. Thus, for example,\nprosecution of Epstein for a pre-2ool offense that arose out of the FBI/USAO investigation into\nEpstein’s background, or for an unlisted statutory offense that arose from the grand jury\ninvestigation, would have been prohibited under the NPA.\n\nThe co-conspirator immunity provision does not include even those broad limitations. It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be prosecuted, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> principles to have been\nintentional. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28. At\nminimum, the silence as to time period and covered conduct is an ambiguity and therefore should\nbe resolved against the government. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 269.\n\nEven if the NPA were construed as placing some limitation on co-conspirator immunity,\nno rational limitation could exclude the conduct alleged here. The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\nidentical to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government's <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

First, like the Wartime Suspension Act in Bridges,\n§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such\nexceptions should be “narrouly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-l6 (citing United States v.\nMcElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639 (l926)); see also Comm ’r v. Clark, 489 U.S. 726, 739 (l989) (“we\nusually read the exception narrouly in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision,”\nparticularly when the exception is “somewhat ambiguous”). Second, § 3282 itself requires that\nany exception to the five-year rule be “expressly provided by law.” l8 U.S.C. § 3282 (emphasis\nadded). Nouhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to cover offenses that could (but need not) be\nproved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a minor. And third, under the rule of\nlenity, ambiguity with respect to criminal statutes should be construed in favor of the defendant.\nBurrage v. United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4); see also United States v. Valle, 8o7 F.3d\n5o8, 523 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“where, as here, the Government and the defense both posit plausible\ninterpretations of a criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt the defendant’s\nconstruction”). To do otherwise would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of\nrepose’ that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law.” See Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l5-\nl6; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (‘criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose” (internal quotation omited)).*\n\nB. The offenses charged in Counts One through Four do not necessarily entail\n\nthe sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.\n\nUnder the “necessarily entails” approach, § 3283 does not apply: None of the charged\ncounts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See l8\n® Nor has the Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because the issue arose in the context of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, the court concluded only that it was “not obvious” that § 3283 required an elements-\nbased approach.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2.

The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 9 of l2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.

American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so.

Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly.

In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The French Ministry of Justice’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality.

The NPA Does Not Bind the Southern District of New York\n\nAs an initial mater, the NPA is not enforceable in this District. To the contrary, it is black-\nleter law in this Circuit that a plea agreement in one district does not apply elsewhere, in the\nabsence of express indications not present here. Indeed, the Second Circuit has considered and\nrejected the exact arguments the defendant advances in her motion. The defendant’s motion is\nwithout any basis in the law and should be denied.\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A\nplea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea\nis entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”’));\nUnited States v.

This Circuit “presumes a narrou\nreading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a\nmore expansive <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> was contemplated.” United States v.

To\nmeet this burden, a defendant must establish that either the text of the agreement or the\n“negotiations between defendant and prosecutor” indicate a promise to bind other districts. United\nStates v. Russo, 8ol F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. l986). For the reasons set forth belou, the defendant\nhas failed to establish that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the NPA would bind other\ndistricts.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002968.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34 of 239\nnot parties to the agreement.

To hold otherwise would turn Annabi on its head.\n\nThe defendant next argues that the follouing provision of the NPA evinces an intent to\n\nbind the entire federal government:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to\n\nprovide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein\n\nsuccessfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this\n\nagreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any\n\ncriminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,\n\nincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley\n\nGroff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\nNPA at 5; Def. Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 35 of 239\nprosecution . . . will be instituted in this District”). In other words, the NPA was expressly limited\nto the USAO-SDFL.? Given this provision, it would be unnatural to read a broader application to\nother districts—based on no textual indicia—into the provision relating to co-conspirators.\nMoreover, the defendant’s reading of the NPA would require the Court to adopt the view that,\nwhere a plea agreement contains limiting terms, they must be repeated in every paragraph in order\nto have their natural and common-sense effects.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> strains common sense.\nIn order to accept the defendant’s arguments, the Court would have to reach the counterintuitive\nconclusion that Epstein expressly bargained for broader immunity for his co-conspirators than he\ndid for himself. That is, under the defendant’s reading of the agreement, Epstein bargained to\nprotect co-conspirators nationally for crimes they commited with Epstein, but Epstein only sought\nprotection for himself in the Southern District of Florida. The text of the agreement does not\nsupport such a puzzling <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. Instead, the more natural reading of the NPA is that its\nrepeated references to the U.S. Atorney’s Office and “this District” reflect a universal limitation\non the NPA: it applies only to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nFinally, at several points in her motion, the defendant emphasizes that the NPA contains\nthe word “global,” but she does not appear to argue that this creates an affirmative appearance that\nthe NPA binds other districts. (Def. Mot. l at 9, l2). Nor could she. The phrase “Epstein seeks\nto resolve globally his state and federal liability,” by its terms, refers to Epstein’s liability alone.\nSee NPA at 2. Moreover, this language appears directly after several paragraphs describing\ninvestigations conducted by the Florida State Atorney’s Office and the USAO-SDFL. See id. at\nl-2. Thus, in this context, the terms “global” and “state and federal liability” plainly refer to\n> In fact, the NPA states that it was executed ‘on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of Florida.” NPA at 2.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 239\noffenses enumerated in the NPA.? While these same limitations are not repeated in the provision\nthat purports to immunize “co-conspirators,” these limitations apply with equal force across the\nagreement, because that is the only common-sense way to read the NPA. Indeed, and as noted\nabove in a related context, it would be exceedingly strange to interpret the “co-conspirator”\nprovision to extend broader immunity than Epstein negotiated for himself.\n\nThe defendant may assert that the “co-conspirator” provision has absolutely no limitations,\nbut such an argument would lead to absurd results. In particular, in arguing that the “co-\nconspirator” provision lacks any temporal or statutory limitations whatsoever, the defendant seems\nto claim that the NPA immunized her for future crimes including, for example, perjury offenses\nthat she is charged with commiting almost a decade after the NPA was executed. (Def. Mot. l at\n32 (“For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court dismiss the\nindictment.”)). Although the defendant does not highlight this point in her motion—perhaps\nrecognizing hou absurd it would be—that is the natural consequence of her illogical <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>\nof the NPA. Despite advancing an argument that strains common sense, the defendant cites no\ncase in which a court has interpreted a plea agreement to bar prosecution for crimes that pre- or\npost-dated the period covered by the agreement. The Government is aware of no such authority.\nSee United States v. Hallahan, 756 F.3d 962, 974 (7th Cir. 2ol4) (rejecting defense argument that\nplea agreement barred prosecution for subsequent bail jumping, and, in interpreting the\n° By its plain terms, the NPA did not immunize Epstein for his “background,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Mot. l at 27). This provision refers, instead, to a list of “offenses” under federal\nlaw. Indeed, it is unclear hou any plea agreement could immunize a defendant’s “background.”\nSimilarly, the fact that the USAO-SDFL interviewed Minor Victim-2 does not mean that this case\n“arose out of” the USAO-SDFL investigation, an assertion the defendant’s motion does not explain\nor support with evidence. As the Indictment makes clear, the events underpinning the Indictment\ninvolve multiple victims and specific legal charges that were not within the scope of the USAO-\nSDFL investigation. As discussed in greater detail belou, Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-3\nwere never interviewed by the USAO-SDFL, and they did not agree to speak with law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002979.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 239\nlimitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis\nmight have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations\namong private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l3, l998) (“Even if Santobello could\nestablish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there\nis litle knoun authority that would allou him to enforce the agreements as a third party\nbeneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (lst Cir. l99l)).\n\nFollouing this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to\nenforce plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma Viju, the defendant claimed that the\nGovernment had entered into a plea agreement with her husband, under which the Government\nhad promised not to prosecute her. No. l5 Cr. 24o, 2ol6 WL lo784l, at *l (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll,\n2ol6).

Specifically,\nthe defendant points to an earlier version of the bill, which contained an express retroactivity\nprovision that was not included in the final version of the statute. (Def. Mot. 2 at 6-7). The\ndefendant’s argument on this point is both misleading and unpersuasive. The defendant quotes\nSenator Patrick Leahy’s comments on the 2oo3 conference commitee report to the effect that “the\nconference agreed to drop language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended\nthe limitations period retroactively.” (Def. Mot. 2 at 7). This is a selective quotation; the full\nstatement regarding retroactivity is as follous:\n\nA final point on section 2o2: I am pleased that the conference agreed\n\nto drop language from the original House-passed bill that would\n\nhave extended the limitations period retroactively. That language,\n\nwhich would have revived the government’s authority to prosecute\n\ncrimes that were previously time-barred, is of doubtful\n\nconstitutionality. We are already pushing the constitutional\n\nenvelope with respect to several of the “virtual porn” provisions in\n\nthis bill. I am pleased that we are not doing so in section 2o2 as\n\nwell.\nl49 Cong. Rec. $5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (emphasis added). As\nthe full quotation makes clear, the legislative history does not support the conclusion that when\nCongress amended Section 3283, it declined to adopt the language in the House-passed bill\nbecause it wanted the lengthened statute of limitations to apply only prospectively. Instead,\nSenator Leahy’s comments indicate that Congress declined to add language that would allou for\n2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (2ol6 indictment covering conduct going back\nto l998); United State v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 6l9, 622 (E.D. Va. 2ol9) (2ol9 indictment for\nconduct in 2ooo).

Instead, the defendant\nasks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), which concerned the Wartime\nSuspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at l2-l4).

Bridges, 346 U.S. at 2l6. There is no corresponding\nindication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the\nThird Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:\n\nWhile Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the\nlimitations-extending statute at issue was a narrouly drafted\nexception specifically intended to target frauds related to war\nprocurement.

Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2oo9) (applying the circumstances-specific approach\nto a statute containing the word “involves”)). Moreover, as the Weingarten court observed, the\nSupreme Court has applied the categorical approach to statutes containing the word “involving”\nwhere the statutes at issue also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”\nin a manner that referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct. 865\nF.3d at 59 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (l99o); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l\n(2oo4)). By contrast, the phrase “sexual abuse” in Section 3283 refers to specific conduct, and not\nthe statutory offenses charged in the Indictment.\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to\nSection 3283 would run contrary to Congress’s intention to “cast a wide net to ensnare as many\noffenses against children as possible.” 865 F.3d at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96). On\nthis point, it bears emphasizing that the <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> the defendant advances would lead to absurd\noutcomes, as many federal crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors do not contain, as an\nelement, a requirement that the defendant commit a sex act with a minor. It would run contrary to\nCongress’s intent to interpret Section 3283 in a manner that would exclude many—if not most—\nsexual offenses against children.\n\nThe lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Countentos, 65l F.3d 8o9\n(8th Cir. 2oll), is easily distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,\namong other issues, whether the crime of possessing child pornography involved sexual abuse\nwithin the meaning of Section 3283. /d. at 8l6-l8.

Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. A question is “fundamentally ambiguous” when “it is not a phrase with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual\nunderstanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and\noffered as testimony.” /d. at 375 (internal quotation marks omited). In such a case, the “answers\nassociated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury\nconviction.” United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 8o8 (2d Cir. l992) (quoting Lighte, 782\nF.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a case involving post-conviction appellate review, the Court\nfound that a question was fundamentally ambiguous because it used the word ““you’ without\nindication that, unlike the prior two questions, the appellant was nou being questioned in his role\nas trustee.” 782 F.2d at 376. “[F]undamental ambiguity,” houever, “is the exception, not the\nrule.” United States v. Sarwari, 669 F.3d 4ol, 4o7 (4th Cir. 2ol2) (quoting United States v.\nFarmer, l37 F.3d l265, l269 (loth Cir. l998)). A defendant cannot demonstrate fundamental\nambiguity simply by shouing that words used in a question are amenable to multiple meanings,\nor that an answer “might generate a number of different interpretations.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375;\nUnited States v.

Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d l2l8, l22l (2d Cir. l976). Critically, and as\nnoted with respect to Lighte above, courts generally evaluate whether a challenge to a perjury\ncount on the basis that a question was fundamentally ambiguous after trial and follouing the\ndevelopment of a full factual record. See, e.g., Strohm, 67l at ll75 (appeal follouing conviction);\nSarwari, 669 F.3d at 4o6 (same); Farmer, l37 F.3d at l269 (appeal follouing conviction and\npartial Rule 29 dismissal) Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8o8 (appeal follouing conviction); cf’ United\nStates v. Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l3 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying a motion to dismiss a perjury\ncount). Indeed, the defendant cites no case in which a court has dismissed a perjury count on the\nbasis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.\n\nBecause perjury requires a knouing false statement, the law does not permit conviction\nbased on answers that are literally true. See Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. Nor can a conviction rest on\nanswers that are literally true but unresponsive, and therefore “arguably misleading by negative\nimplication.” /d.; see Bronston v. United States, 4o9 U.S. 352, 362 (l973). But when “the answer\nis false, the fact that it is unresponsive is immaterial.” United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d lo42, lo49\n(2d Cir. l976). Even statements that “could be literally true in isolation” can support a perjury\nconviction if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”\nUnited States v.

But the defendant’s\nprofessed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain\nand obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human\nlife span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex\nwith Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when\nshe answered it in July 2ol6, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the\nquestions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she nou assigns to those questions: whether,\nduring the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself\nhaving sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to shou that she was.\nSee, e.g., Indictment § l (stating that the defendant “assisted, facilitated, and contributed to”\nEpstein’s sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant’s answers were not “literally true\nunder any conceivable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the questions.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the\ndefendant’s professed confusion nou and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant\nmotion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous.

Accordingly, a jury should be permited to determine what meaning the\ndefendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false.\nFinally, the defendant answered the follouing questions:\n\nQ.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials.

They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.!” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.' This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nLO OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 348\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003290.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”!4© Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 348\n4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section.

On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” °* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®® Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:7°°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nWI.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original).

Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed.

In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges.

If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper\nweight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did\nnot intend the 2oo3 Amendment to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-\nbarred.\n\n3. The government cannot prevail at step one.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily\ndispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2oo3 Amendment that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit recognized in Weingarten that “there is a more natural <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s intention that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\namendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 22\nno dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for\nlive charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’\nRather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute\nare such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that\nCongress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 283 (framing\nissue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment\nin the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie\nsuggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed\nto have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court\nshould not reach such a conclusion here.\nI. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that\nregardless of whether the 2oo3 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply\nto the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel\nnor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense\ninvolving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the\n’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o (2d Cir. l928)—a case\ndecided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites\nFalter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly\nthan the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post\nFacto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> here, particularly in light of Landgraf and\nToussie.\n\n* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,\ndemonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply\nan inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations\nretroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf\nentirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,\nthereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 22\ncommission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39\n(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense\ninvolving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret\n“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°\n\nThe Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 65l F.3d 8o9 (8th Cir. 2oll),\nsquares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a\ncharge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct\nthat went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted\nsexual abuse. 65l F.3d at 8l7. The government’s atempt to distinguish Coutentos on the\nground that “this case does not involve the possession of child pornography” (Opp. 4l) misses\nthe point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual\nsexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child\npomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283\nrequires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard\nallegations of conduct beyond those elements.\n\nFinally, the government atempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court\nused the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of\nlimitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the\ngovernment fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-\n\n° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”\n\nlanguage is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-4o (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at\n6o n.ll). Houever, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no\ncase in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any\nevent, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an\nineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies.

United States, 57l U.S. 2o4, 2l6 (2ol4), and the principle that “criminal\nlimitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(internal quotations and citation omited).\n\nB. The Offenses Charged in Counts One Through Four Do Not Necessarily\n\nEntail the Sexual or Physical Abuse or Kidnapping of a Child.\n\nThe government appears to argue that even under the “necessarily entails” approach,\n\n§ 3283 applies to the Mann Act offenses at issue here, because § 2422(a) and § 2423(a)\nsomehou necessarily entail the sexual abuse of a child. The government bases this argument on\nits contention that the applicable definition of “sexual abuse” is the definition found at l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35o9(a)(8), because that definition “includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement,\nenticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually\nexplicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of\nchildren, or incest with children.” l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(a)(8). But even under such an expansive\ndefinition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child.\n\nSection 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the\n“employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to engage in any\nsex-related conduct. Rather, § 2422(a) requires only the enticement of an individual—of any\n\" The government also cites United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86 (3d Cir. 2ol5), in which the court rejected the\ndefendant’s comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a\n“necessarily entails” approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court\ncases interpreting the “offense involving” language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to\ninclude Davis and Shular.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo367l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003678.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of34\n\nA. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3678\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page /7 of 34\n\nDkt.

The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to\nand deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2ool and 2oo7.\n\nMaxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the\noffenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. The phrase\n“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in\nwhat?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who\nconspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those\noffenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by Epstein\nfrom 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation.\n\nThe Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.\nThose charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from\ndepositions in 2ol6, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell nou\nconcedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in its\nentirety, perjury counts and all.\n\nThe Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope. The Sl\nsuperseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between l994 and l997, some\nfour years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the\nNPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes commited\nbefore the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation.\nMaxwell’s protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the\noffenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo368l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8of34\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited).

The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 3o\nApp.-o8o7\n3\nG4LMGIUC\nl in Utah.

Instead of two\nalleged “victims,” the indictment here has different categories with three people being identified\nas “Minor Victims,” even though they are not minors. Additionally, an unknoun number of\nunexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: “multiple minor\ngirls,” “victims,” “minor victims,” “minor victims described herein,” “some of Epstein’s minor\nvictims,” and “multiple minor victims.” It is a mystery if the government claims that these\nalleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple “among other\nthing” and “means and methods” alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as:\nassisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc.\nThis Indictment is subject to considerable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare a defense without knouing who her accusers are and whether they are limited to the\nalleged “Minor Victims” or the rest of the universe.\n\n“Second,” the government relies on the general proposition that “Courts in the Second\nCircuit have consistently upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific\ndate.” Resp. at l54. Again, the cited cases are easily distinguishable. Kidd involved a date range\nending in the year of indictment. Moreover, the quoted general language from Kidd, 386 F. Supp.\n3d 364, 369, is incomplete. The court in Kidd explains the range it is referring to by the\nfollouing reference: “See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)\n(holding that ‘on or about June l984’ put a defendant on notice for potential crimes in July or\nearly August of l984 ‘because the [G]overnment is not required to prove the exact date, if a date\nreasonably near is established’).” Jd.

The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4. Rather, in interpreting a plea agreement, “[t]he court looks to the\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l2 of 23\ndemonstrated that the NPA, as a whole, gives rise to such an appearance—and the government\noffers no reasonable alternative <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>.\n\nUnlike Annabi and its progeny, the NPA here contains significant evidence of the parties’\nintent to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL. While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Mortg. Capital,\nInc., 82l F.3d 297, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2ol6); see also Collins v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac, 929 F.3d\n83o, 84l (7th Cir. 2ol9) (noting “common, if not automatic presumption” that “when parties to\nthe same contract use such different language to address parallel issues, it is reasonable to infer\nthat they intend this language to mean different things”) (internal punctuation and citation\nomited); Penncro Assocs., Inc. v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P., 499 F.3d ll5l, ll56-57 (loth Cir.\n2oo7) (same). Thus, the appropriate inference here is that the parties intended to limit Epstein’s\nimmunity, but not immunity for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”).\n\nThe government offers no reasonable alternative explanation for the contrasting language\nin the two provisions. Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> on its head. See, e.g., Bank of\nreasonable understanding of the parties as to the terms of the agreement.” United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x\n268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal citations and emphasis omited).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l9 of 23\nthe government claims, it would not have precluded even the SDFL from bringing charges\narising out of Accuser-2’s allegations of conduct in the l99os. The government cannot seriously\nmake such an argument.\n\nEven the vague contours of the limitations on Epstein’s immunity, houever, are absent\nfrom the co-conspirator immunity provision. And while the government claims it would be\n“exceedingly strange” to interpret the co-conspirator immunity provision more broadly than\nEpstein’s immunity provision (Opp. l6), as explained in Part II above, such an <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> is\nentirely consistent with the government’s focus on Epstein vis-a-vis potential co-conspirators. It\nwould be “exceedingly strange,” houever, for a federal prosecutor who intended to limit co-\nconspirator immunity to specific conduct or specific offenses to omit such limitations from the\ntext of an immunity provision in a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nUnable to explain the absence of such limiting language, the government resorts to the\nreductio ad absurdum argument that unless the Court writes into the NPA the language the\ngovernment nou wishes had been included in 2oo7, Ms. Maxwell can claim that “she is immune\nfrom prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period, anywhere, in the United States.”\nOpp. 3 (emphasis in original). Ms. Maxwell makes no such argument, and a faithful\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA leads to no such conclusion. Ms. Maxwell contends only that a\nprovision that immunizes “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” precludes their prosecution for\nconduct allegedly done in conspiracy with Epstetn—conduct that even the United States\nAtorney for this District has characterized as a “prequel” to offenses by Epstein that the NPA\nundisputedly immunizes.

Such an <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, rather than an insertion\ninto the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the\ngovernment’s interests here, is the “common-sense way to read the NPA” that the Court should\nadopt. See Opp. l6.\n\nIV. Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Conduct Discovery and an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach\nof the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars\nMs. Maxwell’s prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must\nhave meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These\narguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected.\n\nShould the Court have any doubt about the parties’ intent, houever, discovery and an\nevidentiary hearing regarding the parties’ intent are warranted. The government’s arguments\nregarding the parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For\nexample, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is\ndeemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated\nwithout determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the\nFBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into “Epstein’s background”), as well as\nwhich offenses arose out of the undefined “Federal Grand Jury investigation.” Similarly, the\ngovernment’s claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms.\nMaxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the\nSDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL’s awareness\nof Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District. These issues\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its possession that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel\ntold OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision\non.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed\ncharges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the\nfacts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told\nOPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”\n\nVillafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May l5, 2oo7, she emailed\nSloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will\nnot do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 2l, 2oo7, three\nweeks after submiting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel\nasking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something\nlike the current draft, a complaint to allou for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment\ndrastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.”*°\n\nD. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which\n\nVillafatia Opposes\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the\nfederal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May lo,\n2oo7 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s atorneys “want me to tell them the statutes\na Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:\n“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our\ntime concern.” Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\na Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, houever, who was surprised\nthat the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”\nafter Villafafia submited the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum touards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 89 of 349\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'”° The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.'°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “‘a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]Jack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge. The USAO’s actions with respect to victim consultation and the\nDepartment’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the CVRA are discussed in detail in Chapter Three of this Report.\n\nloo The initial draft NPA is atached as Exhibit 2 to this Report.\nLO OPR was unable to identify a template upon which she might have relied.\nlo2 Lourie was not present. During September 2oo7, he was traveling between Florida and Washington, D.C.,\nas he transitioned to his new detail post as Principal Deputy Assistant Atorney General and Chief of Staff to the head\nof the Department’s Criminal Division, Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher. He served in that detail until he left\nthe Department in February 2oo8.\n\n62\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lol of 349\nand had added language waiving the preparation of a presentence investigation (PSI) “so he can\nkeep all of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz. Regarding the prosecution of other individuals, she\nincluded the follouing provision: “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability of the\ndefendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal\nconduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” including\nbut not limited to the conspiracy to solicit minors to engage in prostitution.\n\nIn her email to Lefkouitz, transmiting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:\n\nCould you share the atached draft with your colleagues. It is in\nkeeping with what Andy communicated to me was the operative\n“deal.” The U.S. Atorney hasn’t had a chance to review all of the\nlanguage, but he agrees with it in principle.\n\n[The West Palm Beach manager] and I will both be available at 2:oo.\n... One of my suggestions is going to be (again) that we all sit doun\ntogether in the same room, including Barry [Krischer] and/or Lanna\n[Belohlavek], so we can hash out the still existing issues and get a\nsigned document.\n\nVillafafia also emailed Acosta directly, telling him she planned to meet with Epstein’s\natorneys to work on the plea agreement, and asking if Acosta would be available to provide final\napproval. Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”!!? Villafafia replied to Acosta’s\nll9 As noted throughout the Report, Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of her supervisors’ motivations for their actions\noften differed from the supervisors’ explanations for their actions. Because it involved subjective interpretations of\nindividuals’ motivations, OPR does not reach conclusions regarding the subjects’ differing views but includes them\nas an indication of the communication issues that hindered the prosecution team.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll5 of 349\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll9 of 349\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”!4° Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l24 of 349\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l27 of 349\n4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” !** Ina follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l35 of 349\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”'®’ Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l9 of 349\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the nghts included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such nghts\nwere afforded. The passage of the CVRA repealed the nights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)). Department training emphasizes that the VRRA obligates the Department to provide\nvictim services, which atach upon the detection of a crime, while the CVRA contains court-\nenforceable rights that atach upon the filing of a charging instrument.\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA and added the follouing two rights:*©°\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nIl. THE DEPARTMENT’S <span class=\"highlight\">INTERPRETATION</span> OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\nor OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 245 of 349\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed.

The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*!

In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe protection they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004717.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page lo of 26\n\nthat Gonzalez could not have reasonably understood the plea agreement to restrict the Western\nDistrict of New York.”); United States v.

But an\nequally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to\nthe investigation itself.” That <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> is all the more reasonable in context, because\nChemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a protective order and\nprosecutors during a pending criminal investigation.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\nCommonwealth—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The Commonwealth filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 63 of 8o\ncircumstances, implicated Cosby’s due process rights, former D.A. Castor’s post-hoc\natempts to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our\nquery lies instead in the objectively indisputable evidence of record demonstrating D.A.\nCastor’s patent intent to induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.\n\nIn January and February of 2oo5, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into\nConstand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that the\ncase was saddled with deficiencies such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to\nprosecute Cosby. To announce his decision, the district atorney elected to issue a signed\npress release—an uncommon tactic in the typical case, but not necessarily so in cases\nof high public profile or interest.\n\nIn that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the\ninvestigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced\nthat he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was not conditioned in any way,\nshape, or form. D.A. Castor did not say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future\ndate, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was subject to being\noverturned by any future district atorney.\n\nThere is nothing from a reasonable observer’s perspective to suggest that the\ndecision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the later\nportion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this mater that\n[District Atorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press\nRelease, 2/l7/2oo5; N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

The entire\npassage reads as follous:\n\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\n\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\n\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint potential jurors.\n\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\n\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\n\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Atorney Castor\n\ncautions all parties to this mater that he will reconsider this decision should\n\nthe need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by\n\nothers) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flatering\n\nlight. The District Atorney encourages the parties to resolve their dispute\n\nfrom this point forward with a minimum of rhetoric.\nId. (emphasis added).\nzs There is no doubt that there are two decisions at issue: the decision not to\nprosecute and the decision not to discuss that choice in public. The dissent would\nendorse the trial court’s selective <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of D.A. Castor’s language in the press\nrelease, finding at a minimum that D.A. Castor’s assertion that he would reconsider the\n“decision” is ambiguous. But a plain reading of the release belies such a construction.\nLike the trial court’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the relevant paragraph of the press release, the\ndissent’s finding of ambiguity can result only when one overlooks the context and\nsurrounding statements quite entirely. D.A. Castor stated that he did not intend to discuss\nthe details of his decision not to prosecute. In the very next sentence, D.A. Castor stated\nthat he would reconsider “this decision” if the need arose. In context, “this decision” must\nnaturally refer to the decision not to discuss the mater with the public. This is so because\nannouncing that particular decision was the very purpose of the immediately preceding\nstatement, and the subject sentence naturally modifies that prior statement. D.A. Castor\nalready had stated earlier in the press release that he had decided not to prosecute\nCosby. Thus, when D.A. Castor referred to “this decision” in the particular paragraph\nunder examination, he was referring not to a decision addressed much earlier in the press\nrelease but rather to the decision that he had stated for the first time in the immediately\npreceding sentence. Even more compelling is the fact that the entirety of the paragraph\nrelates to D.A. Castor’s concern about the potential effect that any public statements that\nhe would make might have on jurors empaneled in a civil case. Nothing at all in that\nparagraph pertains to the decision not to prosecute Cosby. As noted, D.A. Castor already\nhad addressed the non-prosecution decision. There is no support for the notion that D.A.\nCastor was referring to his decision not to prosecute Cosby in the middle of a paragraph\ndirected exclusively to: (l) the potential impact that any public explication by D.A. Castor\nmight have upon the fairness of a civil case; and (2) D.A. Castor’s derivative decision not\nto discuss the mater publicly in order to avoid that potential impact.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law.

CERTAIN EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT MINOR VICTIMS\n\nCONSENTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE MAY BE ADMISSIBLE.\n\nThe government seeks blanket preclusion of evidence or argument that the accusers\n“consented to sexual abuse.” It bears noting that the Indictment does not charge sexual abuse.\nThe charged offenses allege “sexual activity” (Counts One through Four) and “sex trafficking”\n(Counts Five and Six).\n\nThe age of consent for sexual contact purposes varies by jurisdiction. The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7! New Mexico does\nnot have a specific age of consent statute but criminalizes all sexual contact of a minor under the\nage of l3 when no coercion or force is involved.*” In the context of the charged offense focusing\n°8 NY Penal Law Ann. § l3o.o3(3)(a).\n\n»?

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005894.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (l976) quo-\ntations of Freud in the same article support this <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>: “Freud later\nassigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to\nfictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-\nriences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, houever, what constitutes a\n“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use\nviolence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active\nparticipant.\nArchaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer\nA second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the\noffender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual\nabuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:\n\ne “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-\nguished as unusually charming and atractive in their outward person-\nalities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the\npossibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather\nthan the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5l4).\n\ne “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims\nare usually knoun to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch\n& Weiss, l962, p. 78).\n\ne “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his\ncharm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent\none who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Gruget, l952, p. 826).\n\ne “Abraham (l9o7) and Bender and Blau (l937) have commented on\nhou charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,\nNadelson, Krieger, & Backman, l977, p. 332).\n\nThree examples of authors atempting to remedy this archaic view are as\nfollous:\n\ne “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an\natack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have\nfull adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be\nviewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, l969, p. 859).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 299\n\nStop it Nou (2oo3).

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had.

Though the Second Circuit has not\nruled on the admissibility of a grooming expert, it has previously recognized the academic\nliterature on grooming to facilitate sexual abuse of minors.

CERTAIN EVIDENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT MINOR VICTIMS\n\nCONSENTED TO SEXUAL ABUSE MAY BE ADMISSIBLE.\n\nThe government seeks blanket preclusion of evidence or argument that the accusers\n“consented to sexual abuse.” It bears noting that the Indictment does not charge sexual abuse.\nThe charged offenses allege “sexual activity” (Counts One through Four) and “sex trafficking”\n(Counts Five and Six).\n\nThe age of consent for sexual contact purposes varies by jurisdiction. The offenses\ncharged in the S2 Indictment allege sexual activity with minors and focus on age, rather than\nmental or physical incapacity. Accordingly, to qualify as sexual activity with a minor, the statute\nmust prohibit sexual acts based at least on age of the purported victim. See Esquival-Quintana v.\nSessions, l37 S. Ct. l562 (2ol7). As the Supreme Court noted, “state criminal codes aid our\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of ‘sexual abuse of a minor’ by offering useful context.” /d. at l577 n.3. For\npurposes of sexual activity alleged in this case, the definition of “minor” varies among states and\nnations: New York defines “minor” as a person under the age of l77%; Florida: under the age of\nl8°; United Kingdom: under the age of l6°°; France: under the age of l5.7!

Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming.

But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the reliability of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006819.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of\nDietz 33\nCioffi (l976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer\nonly to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had\ndiscovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-\nrience before puberty.

The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 299\n\nStop it Nou (2oo3).

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Dr. Dietz may\ntestify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent conduct is grooming\nand that the label “grooming” carries within it a subjective judgment of an alleged perpetrator’s\nintent. These opinions, when limited to a criticism of Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming,\nbolster Dr. Dietz’s opinion that grooming does not have a setled definition and is hard to\nmeasure. They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.\n\nBut the Court will preclude any opinion testimony that there is inadequate evidence of an\nintent to groom as applied to Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dietz’s disclosed opinions that\nthere is not “adequate evidence of either’ motive or intent, that grooming imputes intent “to the\nDefendant,” and that “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding intent,\nall suggest that Dr. Dietz would testify that there is inadequate evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.\nNotice at 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that effect would plainly violate Rule 7o4(b). The\nCourt therefore precludes these three aspects of Dr. Dietz’s opinion as well as any other\ntestimony that would similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming and\ninstead suggest that there is inadequate evidence of intent in this case.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that there is not empirical data on whether minors with particular\nvulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted by perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d. at 4.

Indeed, the only question the jury raised in\nthe Note was whether it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element if they found that Ms.\nMaxwell helped arrange Jane’s return flight from New Mexico as opposed to her flight to New\nMexico. /d. Any sexual abuse that occurred in New Mexico was not a violation of New York\nlaw and was therefore an entirely distinct offense from the one charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> that the jury did not credit Jane’s\ntestimony that Ms. Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s sexual abuse in New York\nand was instead focused on her involvement in the New Mexico conduct. The most important\npiece of evidence corroborating Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot,\nDave Rodgers. See GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence offered\nat trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York and New Mexico and when\nthose trips may have taken place. According to the flight logs, there were only two trips that\nJane may have taken while she was under the age of l7, which was significant because to convict\nunder Count Four, the jury had to find that Jane was under l7 years old when the abuse took\nplace. The first was a trip from Palm Beach to New York (Teterboro) on November ll, l996,\nwhen Jane was l6 years old. GX-662-R at 44. The second was a trip from New York\n(Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997, also when Jane was l6 years old. GX-\n662-R at 48. The critical difference between the two trips was that Ms. Maxwell was not a\npassenger on the first trip to New York but was a passenger on the second trip to New Mexico.\n\nGiven the text of the Jury Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s\ntrips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her\ntrip to New Mexico.

Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five nevertheless\ninvolve distinct conspiracies.

Or it could have been asking if it was permissible to consider the New\nMexico testimony in its assessment of Count Four. Indeed, the Defendant proffered a different\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> when the Court first read the note at trial. Initially, the Defendant argued that the\njury was asking if the Defendant could be found guilty solely for aiding and abeting a flight\nhome from New Mexico, which she said raised the issue of whether sexual activity could be the\n“significant or motivating purpose” for the travel. Trial Tr. at 3l28-3o. It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking. Maxwell Reply at 6 n.2.° But hinging the note’s meaning on an absent comma does\nnot indicate a meaning “clear on [its] face.”” Maxwell Reply at 9. With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent. See United States v. Rommy, 5o6 F.3d lo8, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“[A] trial court\n6 The Defendant also accuses the Government of muddying the inquiry by inserting a comma in this supposedly\ncrucial spot.

The government ignores the background commentary to § 4Bl.5, which explicitly states\nthat the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the\npublic.” USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government\nrejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> and application of § 4Bl.5. See Stinson v. United States, 5o8 U.S. 36, 38 (l993)\n(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative\nunless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly\nerroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing\nCommission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and\nthe explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over lo years\nto her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a\ndanger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.\n\nB. Applying § 4Bl.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.\n\nApplying § 4Bl.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is\nsignificantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of\ndefendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4Bl.5.\nThe Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously\nabsurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 24o, 246 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\nSection 4Bl.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been\nconvicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants\nwho have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4Bl.5(b)). As discussed above, the\npurpose of the Act and § 4Bl.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders.

Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id.

Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots.

(Def. Mem. l4-l6).

At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”.

To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”.

First, the Ministry’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French nationality, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\nnationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\nnationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

The French Ministry of Justice’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020200.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePagelGhl2\nnationality is assessed at the time the offense was commited, any loss of nationality subsequent\nto said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said\nassessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the\nopinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the\nextradition request. See Reply, Ex. A4ll. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no\ncase law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 2l.\n\nExacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend\nthemselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(l) the Extradition Treaty between\nthe United States and France of April 23, l996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the\nRequested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but\nthe executive authority of the United States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the\nUnited States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person\nsought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited.” See Reply,\nEx. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly\nprovides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is\nrequested.”” Jd. § lo; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty\nas to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her\nability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely\n' The Court cites the translated version of the leter, though the original leter is in French.\n\n* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations.

The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Atorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Atorney makes a\npromise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal\ngovernment to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l); United States v.\nReady, 82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Atorney for\nthe Southern District of Florida had the pouer to bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit\nprecedent and principles of contract <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, the Court concludes that they did not.\n\nIn United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the\noffice of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d 67o, 672\n(2d Cir. l985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea\nagreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying\nAnnabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from\nthis ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United\nStates.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam); United States v.\nGonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4). Those are common shorthand. A plea\nagreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Atorney for Such-\nand-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where\nsigned.\n\nMaxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA\ndealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Atorneys in other\ndistricts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020766.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel48 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 34\n\nDkt. No. l42-l at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to\nand deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2ool and 2oo7.\n\nMaxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the\noffenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. The phrase\n“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in\nwhat?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who\nconspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those\noffenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by Epstein\nfrom 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation.\n\nThe Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.\nThose charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from\ndepositions in 2ol6, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell nou\nconcedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in its\nentirety, perjury counts and all.\n\nThe Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope. The Sl\nsuperseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between l994 and l997, some\nfour years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the\nNPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes commited\nbefore the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation.\nMaxwell’s protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the\noffenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020767.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel49 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 34\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\ndisclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020769.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 34\nfor example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\nand not follou through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential\ningredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related\nconspiracy charges.\n\nThis approach is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to evaluate\nprior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495\nU.S. 575, 6o2 (l99o). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look\nonly to the statutory definitions—l.e., the elements” of the relevant offense to determine if the\nprovision applies “and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.\nUnited States, 57o U.S. 254, 26l (2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Whether a statute\nrequires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. To\ndetermine whether Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to an offense in the\nabstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute’s “text,\ncontext, and history.” United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2327 (2ol9).\n\nThough it has not authoritatively setled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly\nsuggested that Maxwell’s approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d\n48, 58-6o (2d Cir. 2ol7), the Second Circuit discussed at length hou the text, context, and\nhistory of § 3283 shou that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific\napproach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol\nF.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he\nSupreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction\ncontexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o769\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020771.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel53 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general intention to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020814.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel96 of 2o8\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o8l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the questionnaire, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49.

It was only after a\nprotracted discussion, spanning ten pages of transcript, that the Defendant eventually suggested\nthat the jury was considering convicting the Defendant on Count Four solely on conduct in New\nMexico without any travel to New York. On this score, the Defendant argued at trial and argues\nnou that the absence of a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if” revealed the jury’s\nthinking.

With or without the comma,\nthe note was ambiguous as to the destination of the hypothetical return flight, the testimony\nbeing referenced, and the legal question being asked.\n\nThe note was clear on one point—the jury was asking about the second element of Count\nFour. Accordingly, the Court sent the jury back to the charge, which accurately instructed that\nCount Four had to be predicated on finding a violation of New York law. This response ensured\nthat the jury focused on the correct instruction and, in turn, reminded the jury that the only state\nlaw at issue was New York’s, even if sexual abuse in New Mexico was relevant evidence of\nintent.

But that did\nnot deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when\nCongress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast\na wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” Al44. This\nquestionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5), which itself quotes an Eleventh\nCircuit case, United States v.

Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different\nstatute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283. Worse still, the full\nquote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.\nSee Dodge, 597 F.3d at l355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our\nconclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against\nchildren as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by\nextension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative\nhistory for § 3283 that does not exist.

U.S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2ol7). The\nDistrict Court conceded, as it had to, that Weingarten is not controlling (Al47), but\nit essentially and erroneously treated Weingarten as though it were. The only\nquestion in Weingarten was whether the petitioner’s trial counsel provided\nconstitutionally deficient representation by conceding that an indictment charging\nMann Act violations was timely. See 865 F.3d at 52. The petitioner contended\nthat his trial counsel should have argued that § 3283 must be interpreted under a\ncategorical standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was\nnot obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it today, that a\ncourt must apply a categorical approach, rather than a fact-specific analysis, to\ndetermine whether an offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Id. at 58-59\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021178.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document aA 3536o38, Page6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 348\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s\ntimeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”\nbut her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia\nas “out over her skis a litle bit” and “ahead of’ Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*°\nMenchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about\nwhether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision.

OPR\nnotes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia\nexpressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those\nconflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the\ntestimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.\n\n45 Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and\nthat caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel.

Villafafia’s\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”\nHouever, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2oo7 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing\ncharges in] this mater was a foregone conclusion.”\n\n46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he\nhad spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l23o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021262.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O88 3536o38, Page9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 88 of 348\nVillafafia added that the PBPD Chief had alerted the FBI that an upcoming news article would\nreport that Epstein was “going to plead to a state charge” and the PBPD Chief “wanted to knou if\nthe victims had been consulted about the deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafafia’s email to Acosta\nwith a note that read simply, “fyi.”\n\nLater that evening, Villafafia circulated to Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterban two alternative\ndocuments: a draft federal plea agreement and a draft NPA.'” The draft federal plea agreement,\nfollouing the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 37l to entice minors to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration\nas a sexual offender, with a Rule ll(c) binding sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The draft\nNPA contained the terms presented to the defense team on July 3l, 2oo7, and called for Epstein to\nenter a state plea by September 28, 2oo7. Villafafia told OPR that because she had never seen a\nnon-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she found either using USAO or the\nDepartment’s internal online resources, but she did not do any additional research regarding the\nuse of non-prosecution agreements. !°!\n\n3. September 7, 2oo7: Acosta, Other USAO Atorneys, and FBI\nSupervisors Meet with Epstein Atorneys Starr, Lefkouitz, and\nSanchez\n\nOn Friday, September 7, 2oo7, Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, Villafafia’s co-counsel,\nOosterban, and one or two supervisory FBI agents met at the USAO’s West Palm Beach office\nwith defense atorneys Sanchez and, for the first time, Starr and Lefkouitz.°? This was Acosta’s\nfirst meeting with Epstein’s defense team. Villafafia understood the purpose of this meeting was\nto afford Epstein’s counsel an opportunity to “make a pitch” as to why the case should not be\nprosecuted federally. Villafafia recalled that at a “pre-meet” before defense counsel arrived,\nAcosta did not express concern about the viability of the prosecution or the strength of the case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that the meeting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance for the defense to\npresent their arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily on federalism. Villafafia\nsimilarly recalled that the meeting mainly consisted of the defense argument that the Epstein case\nshould remain a state mater in which the USAO should not interfere. Both Villafafia and her\nco-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly to Acosta, and that Starr, who had held\nSenate-confirmed positions in the government, commented to Acosta that he and Acosta were “the\nonly people in this room who have run the [gantlet] of confirmation by the Senate.” Acosta did\nnot recall the comment, but he told OPR, “[B]ack in July, we had decided that we were going\nChapter Three, the Department’s position at the time was that victim consultation was not required in maters in which\nthe government did not pursue a federal charge.

I have already told Jay that the PSI language . . . was\nunacceptable to our office.” Of even greater significance, in a follou-up email, Villafafia noted\nthat the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to a registrable offense and\nthe entire provision relating to monetary damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn the afternoon, Villafafia circulated her oun proposed “hybrid” plea agreement, first\ninternally to the management team with a note stating that it “contains the l8/l2 split that Jay and\nAndy agreed to,” and then to Lefkouitz.

Acosta replied, “I don’t think I should be part of negotiations. I’d rather leave it to you\nif that’s ok.” Acosta told OPR that “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was\nimportant for him “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You can meet, like I did in\nSeptember, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think\nyour trial lawyer needs discretion to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, houever, that she did not\nunderstand Acosta to be giving her discretion to conduct the negotiations as she saw fit; rather, she\nbelieved Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face negotiations because “he wanted to have\nan appearance of having sort of an arm’s length from the deal.”\"'?

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nai The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021288.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagell6 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021292.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TIS 3536o38, Pagel2o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”'*° Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe that this is\nas far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021297.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel25 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021300.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l6 3536o38, Pagel28 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l26 of 348\n4. Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Crvil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays.!°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.”!°* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nou As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021308.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel36 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l34 of 348\nfederal prosecution is not appropriate in this case.”!®8 Lefkouitz alluded to the possibility of\nseeking further review of the mater by the Deputy Atorney General or Atorney General, should\nthe defense be unable to “resolve this mater directly with” Acosta.\n\nAcosta declined the request to respond personally and directed Lefkouitz to communicate\nwith the “trial team.” That same day, Sloman sent Lefkouitz a leter asking that all further\ncommunication about the case be made to Villafafia or her immediate supervisor, and reiterating\nthat Acosta would not respond personally to counsel’s email or calls. Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021392.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22o of 258\nSA-2l8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l8 of 348\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the\nvictim’s dignity and privacy.\n\nAlthough many of the rights included in the CVRA already existed in federal law as part\nof the VRRA, the CVRA afforded crime victims standing to assert their rights in federal court or\nby administrative complaint to the Department, and obligated the court to ensure that such rights\nwere afforded.

THE DEPARTMENT’S <span class=\"highlight\">INTERPRETATION</span> OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021418.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 344 3536o38, Page246 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 244 of 348\nreview the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly\nexpansive <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>” of l8 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIn a December l9, 2oo7 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two\nparagraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties\nintended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they\nwould have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span>, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en bane.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*”\n\n228 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

Discussion\n\nThe District Court correctly rejected Maxwell’s ar-\ngument that the NPA bars this prosecution. Maxwell\nhas no right to invoke the protections of the NPA be-\ncause she is neither a party to nor a third-party bene-\nficiary of the agreement. But even if Maxwell had\nstanding under the NPA, it would not bar this prose-\ncution because it was plainly intended to bind only the\nUSAO-SDFL. Thus, Judge Nathan rightly concluded\nthat under longstanding Second Circuit precedent, the\nNPA does not bind USAO-SDNY. Accordingly, this\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l676\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021680.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page33 of 93\n2o\nthat “the federal Grand Jury investigation will be sus-\npended.” (A.l78 (emphasis added)). The grand jury in-\nvestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-\nfer in the same agreement (A.l75), and not any poten-\ntial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.\nFurthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United\nStates” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-\nSDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United\nStates’—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-\nstein with a list of victims. (A.l77 (‘The United States\nshall provide Epstein’s atorneys with a list of individ-\nuals whom it has identified as victims ....”)). Another\nprovision states that the NPA will not be made part of\nthe public record and commits “the United States’—\nagain, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-\nstein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-\nquest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.l78).\nThe mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the\nNPA used the phrase “United States” rather than\n“U.S. Atorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties\nintended an unusually broad immunity provision. See,\ne.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S.\n5l9, 54o (2ol3) (‘We are not aware, houever, of any\ncanon of <span class=\"highlight\">interpretation</span> that forbids interpreting differ-\nent words used in different parts of the same statute\nto mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan\nconcluded, given the repeated limitations of the com-\nmitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDEL, including\nthe commitment not to prosecute Epstein, “[i]t is not\nplausible ... that the parties intended to drastically\nexpand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l68o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021804.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Pagelo of 26\ncontemplates a broader restriction.”\" And while Maxwell contends\nthat we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed\noutside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.’* Applying\nAnnabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution\nby USAO-SDNY.

Carr, 424 F.3d 2l3, 22l (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(holding that “it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the\ndefendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense\nwith which he was charged” (internal citation omited)).\n\nNone of Thomas’s proffered excuses relate to proving or rebuting the elements of a\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false,\nwhether it was material to a mater within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knouingly\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023034.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE: ISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S INTERACTIONS\nA.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such guidelines. Victim and Witness Protection Act,\nPub. L. No. 97-29l, § 6, 96 Stat. l248 (l982).

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 9 G.2, available at htps://“www justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\nBL See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings. The 2oll revision\nremedied this omission.\n\n24l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23279\n"};
