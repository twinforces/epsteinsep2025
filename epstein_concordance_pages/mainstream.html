Epstein did so in 2oo8 and went to\nprison for l3 months. At that time, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.\n\nIn 2ol6, atorneys representing plaintiffs in civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell met with\na section chief in the United States Atorney’s Office (““USAO”) for the Southern District of New\nYork (“SDNY”) and pitched the idea of bringing a criminal case against Ms. Maxwell for\nconduct similar, if not identical, to that alleged in the current indictment. The section chief\nappropriately declined.\n\nThen, in 2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was executed, an explosive front-page\narticle in the Miami Herald reported detailed allegations, including from atorneys representing\nplaintiffs in civil litigation, about Epstein’s conduct, Acosta’s handling of the 2oo6 investigation,\nthe process by which the NPA had been negotiated, and its substantive terms. In the wake of the\narticle, the government indicted Epstein in this District for conduct allegedly commited between\n2oo2 and 2oo5. Again, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThus, at three separate junctures over more than a decade, the government had occasion\nto consider whether to charge Ms. Maxwell for the nou 25-year-old conduct alleged in the\ncurrent indictment. Every time, the government—appropriately—did not do so. Indeed, such\ncharges would have been baseless.\n\nBut in August 2ol9, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell. His death while in federal\ncustody was not only disturbing, but publicly embarrassing for the government, characterized by\nthe then-Atorney General as the result of “‘a perfect storm of screw-ups.”\n\nWorse still, almost to the day after Epstein died, the barrage of media atention shifted\nfrom Epstein to Ms. Maxwell, including in <span class=\"highlight\">mainstream</span> publications.

Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as\npunishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure\npresence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of\npunishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If\ndetention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to\nincorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.\nMaxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the\nCourt’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of\nproportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.\nImprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to\nbe innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration\nis the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing\ndamages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical\nformula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’\n\nThere is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,\nand punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention\nin general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to\n27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and\nWashington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees.
