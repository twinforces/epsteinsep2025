Home confinement monitored by 24-hour private security guards — a lesser\nrestriction than pretrial detention — has proven effective in meeting those goals in many\nprominent cases prosecuted in our Circuit, including cases against defendants as infamous as\nBernie Madoff, Mare Dreier and David Brooks.\n\nTo be clear, defense counsel are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as required\nwithout resort to this measure. And we understand and appreciate Your Honor’s opposition to it.\nSee United States v. Zarrab, No. l5-CR-867, 2ol6 WL 368l423 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6). Still,\nMr. Epstein stands ready and willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards should the Court deem it\nnecessary or appropriate.\n\nMore precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as more akin to\ncustody than release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to “buy their way out” of jail\npending trial. Jd. at *2, *9-lo, *l3 (citation omited). Nonetheless, a band of other courts in our\narea have endorsed the procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its use.*\n\nFor reasons explained elsewhere, round-the-clock, privately funded security guards will\nvirtually guarantee — not just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’s presence in the circumstances of\nthis case. Accordingly, and given the division of authority surrounding the practice, we\nrespectfully propose it here as a fallback, asking the Court to revisit its propriety despite the\nreservations expressed in Zarrab. Those reservations, though admirably <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> and sincerely\nheld, raise substantial equal protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to release on the\nleast restrictive conditions in the circumstances presented — an inherently individualized\ndetermination — based largely on socioeconomic status, a suspect if not invidious classification.\nAvoiding “inequity and unequal treatment” rooted in such dubious socioeconomic distinctions —\ndoing “equal right to the poor” and “rich” alike — are imperatives that run both ways. /d.

Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

No. 42 at 5 n.4.\n\nThe Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant’s request for an order directed to\nBOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that “[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff,” thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell’s ability to communicate with her counsel is in\nno way interfered. Dkt. No. 4l at 4n.5. And as to the more general implementation of\nsurveillance procedures, the Court credits BOP’s duty to ensure the safety and security of the\nDefendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 44l U.S. 52o, 547\n(l979) (‘Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.”). Nor does the Defendant provide\nany basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5.\nThough pretrial detainees “may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law,” Wolfish, 44l U.S. at 535, it does not follou that surveillance measures\nare punitive just because the Defendant deems them “onerous.” Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The\nDefendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the\nsurveillance measures are <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper purposes.\n\nAs aresult, Defendant’s request is denied.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

In French law, the conduct charged in all four counts”! would qualify as the crime of\n“proxenetisme” under Articles 225-5 and 225-6 of the French Criminal Code.\n\n44. When commited against a minor, Article 225-7 of the French Criminal Code provides\nthat the crime is punished by an enhanced sentence, namely a statutory maximum of lo\nyears imprisonment (as opposed to 7 years, when commited against an adult)’.\n\n45. Thus, dual criminality would not constitute an obstacle to Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s\nextradition from France to the USA.\n\n(i) ‘Political offense and manifest inconsistency\n\n46.

Article 4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that\n“le]xtradition shall not be granted by France when the offense for which extradition is\nrequested is considered by France as a political offense or as an offense connected with\na political offense or as an offense inspired by political motives”.\n\n48. A political motivation claim requires the Investigating Chamber to examine, to some\nextent, the merits of the case. The Court is also required to look into the merits of the\ncase where the requested person argues that there is a manifest inconsistency between\nthe conduct and the legal offenses in respect of which the extradition is sought’.\n\n49. The conduct described in the indictment does not appear to be manifestly inconsistent\nwith the offenses charged therein.\n\n5o. As to political motivation, French courts have never opposed extradition requests from\nthe USA on this ground‘, In fact, in the past ten years, only one published decision of\nthe Cour de cassation has denied an American extradition request, on the ground that\nthe Investigating Chamber had not verified that the criminal conduct described in the\nrequest constituted a crime in France at the time of commission”. All other published\ndecisions which have ruled on a request from the USA have granted extradition”®.\n\n5l. In light of the elements contained in the Superseding Indictment, Ms Ghislaine Maxwell\ncould not oppose her extradition to the USA on the basis of a political motivation claim,\nthat would have no serious ground, and therefore the Investigating Chamber would not\nlook into the merits of the case against her.\n\nB.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\n2k OK\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3228", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 348\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of l6\n\n° She “persuaded” Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the\nmanner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other\nchildren.” Id.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea\nagreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she\ncommited in Florida.” /d.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” Giuffre and “numerous other\nyoung girls for sexual purposes.” Jd.\n\na Guuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in illegal\nsexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” Jd.\n\nIn the joinder motion, Giuffre also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershouitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many other pouerful men,\nincluding numerous prominent American politicians, pouerful business executives, foreign\npresidents, a well-knoun Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” /d. at 4-6.\n\nGiuffre said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to a\nforeign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” Jd. at 3.\n\nGiuffre suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “conspiracy” when it “secretly”\nnegotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal prosecution of Epstein\nand his “co-conspirators.” /d. at 6.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors.

I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3’ Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l36 of 349\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !7!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4433", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9o of 349\nsentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

Castor\nwas <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\nCommonwealth from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the government’s opposition to limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire. (Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand reliability of the government’s investigation. Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46; Bouen, 799 F.2d at\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5589", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 24\nintent or the truthfulness of the victim’s testimony—does not satisfy the fit or reliability\nrequirements” of Rule 7o2); Bennet & O’ Donohue, 23 J.

Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006278.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page lo of 29\nlo4 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nDenial of Consent\nA key issue in sexual assault is whether consent was given for the sexual\ncontact. Consent is complex and, in real-world situations, may have signifi-\ncant variability and may be rather subtle and, in general, an intricate process.\nRarely do sexual interactions begin with individuals explicitly stating “I give\nyou permission to do x, y, and z” (Hall, l998). Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the interaction for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an interaction (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an interaction, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 69\nno authority indicating that more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand reliability of the government’s investigation.

The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel6 of 24\nintent or the truthfulness of the victim’s testimony—does not satisfy the fit or reliability\nrequirements” of Rule 7o2); Bennet & O’ Donohue, 23 J.

Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 22 of 43 22\nLalWmaxC\n\nl any prejudice analysis from other materials on the docket.\n\n2 And No. 2, I'm still failing to see what the prejudice\n3 is.

Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse.

The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and\nshe profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\nfinancial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAnnie Farmer submits the follouing statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed\n\nmotion for bail.\nis 2K 3\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this mater and once more\nrequest that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\ndemonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\ndemonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last\nseveral years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020888.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Ta262 | 34759ol, Page62 of 22l\nl/26/22, 8:52 PM Case l:2o-cr-oo33Gefsd Shiskheauanverjtrerd initlly doilere Gatligeid Autor daqRectent 4.\nDuring jury selection, hundreds of prospective jurors were given questionnaires asking, among\nother things, if they or anyone in their families had experienced sexual abuse, court records\nshou.\nFor those who answered yes, the judge in the case asked during follou-up questioning if it would\naffect their ability to serve as a fair or impartial juror, the records shou.\nScoty David said he did not recall being asked about his experience during follou-up\nquestioning, knoun as voir dire. He said he \"flew through\" the initial questionnaire and also did\nnot recall being asked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he\nwould have answered honestly.\nThe U.S. Atorney's office in Manhatan wrote a leter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan on\nWednesday asking her to conduct an inquiry into the juror's description of being a victim of\nsexual abuse and his responses to the questionnaire, in light of the juror's statements to outlets\nincluding Reuters.\n\"While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of\ntheir choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit atention by the court,\"\nthe leter read.\nMaxwell's defense atorneys did not respond to requests for comment about Scoty David's\naccount of the jury deliberations or his responses to questions during jury selection.\nJurors were not identified by name during the trial. Scoty David shared with Reuters a\nphotograph of an instruction sheet from the court telling him to return on Nov. 29 for the final\nday of jury selection.

Carolyn said she dropped out of school in seventh grade and was paid\n$3oo - sometimes by Maxwell - each time she gave Epstein an erotic massage.

He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible.

At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors.

I have some ideas about the\n\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\n\nnot sending that yet.\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.37 Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get ano-bill on this... and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\nat In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021309.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel37 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” *”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal... . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief’ Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>\n“Tust seemed unserious.”\n\nTi Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021333.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l59 | 3536o38, Pagel6l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8.

The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafaia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafaia, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7°° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “‘[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021478.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page48 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement|,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP.

The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023147.jpg": "Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023171.jpg": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023174.jpg": "As the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.jpg": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.jpg": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“nolitically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.jpg": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.jpg": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023201.jpg": "sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafania, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.7*° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.7°7\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.jpg": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n485 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029000.jpg": "‘This was a typical l4-year-old girl. ...

The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel.

Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS furnished to him.

He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023174.tif": "As the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.tif": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.tif": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.tif": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.””? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o9 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023181.tif": "narrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at... hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span>” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jomned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l8l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.tif": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3. Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.tif": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the financial resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023201.tif": "sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement\na breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”\n\nThe guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2oo8 was consistent with the dictates\nof the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of l8 months’ incarceration.\nEpstein, houever, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to\nserve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work\nrelease nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County\nStockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve\nhis entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein\nwork release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole\nauthority for administering the work release program.\n\nAfter considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest\nthat the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served\npursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work\nrelease.\n\nF. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Atorney Lefkouitz during the NPA\n\nNegotiations Do Not Establish That Villafania, or Other Subjects, Intended to\nGive Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were <span class=\"highlight\">Motivated</span> by Favoritism or\nOther Improper Influences\n\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s atorney, and filed\nunder seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein atorney Lefkouitz and Villafafia\n(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2oo7 when the NPA was being finalized,\nand thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkouitz’s side of the\ncommunications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s\ncommunications to Lefkouitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over\nEpstein’s objections.**° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as\nproof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s atorneys to keep the\n“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in\nparticular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism touards Epstein. In one\nexample, Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing\nnot to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and\nall of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”\nto finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal\ncharges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press\ncoverage.\n\n236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal\nprotected information.

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafatia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.7°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023314.tif": "not plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not <span class=\"highlight\">motivated</span> or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029000.tif": "‘This was a typical l4-year-old girl. ...
