Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “<span class=\"highlight\">black</span> eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 4 of l3\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nWhen the COVID-l9 pandemic temporarily limited the availability of grand juries in the\nManhatan courthouse, the government responded with an extraordinary measure. Rather than\nwait a short time until residents of counties constituting the Manhatan Division of this District\ncould appear for grand jury service, the government, in its apparent determination to mark the\nanniversary of its indictment of Jeffrey Epstein with a July 2, 2o2o announcement of the\nindictment and arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, sought and obtained an indictment of Ms. Maxwell\nthrough a grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division. In doing so, the government\nprocured Ms. Maxwell’s indictment using a grand jury pool that excluded residents of the\ncommunity in which Ms. Maxwell allegedly commited the offenses with which she is charged,\nand in which she will be tried, in favor of a grand jury drawn from a community in which <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>\nand Hispanic residents are significantly underrepresented by comparison. The government thus\nviolated Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury drawn from a fair-\ncross section of the community.!\n\nIt was unnecessary for the government to take this step. According to an email from a\ncourt official filed in connection with a similar challenge to the government’s practice, a\nManhatan grand jury was seated as early as June 25, 2o2o—four days before Ms. Maxwell was\nindicted. See Exhibit A to Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde,\nNo. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 7o-l (filed Dec. 23, 2o2o). Had the government\nwaited until that time, it might have been unable to meet its arbitrary July 2 deadline, and its\npress conference touting the indictment and arrest of Ms. Maxwell might have had slightly less\n' The fact that Ms. Maxwell herself is neither <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> nor Hispanic does not deprive of her of standing to raise this\nchallenge. “[T]he Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a\nfair cross section of the community, whether or not the systematically excluded groups are groups to which he\nhimself belongs.” Holland v. Hlinois, 493 U.S. 474, 477 (l99o).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2324", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 7 of l3\nreturn the questionnaire (and who are found to be qualified as jurors). /d., Art. lV.A. As with\nthe master wheels, two separate qualified jury wheels are maintained: one for Manhatan and\none for White Plains. When jurors are needed, names are drawn at random from these wheels,\nand summonses are sent to those whose names are drawn. /d., Art. IV.C; Reyes, 934 F. Supp. at\n556.\n\nIn United States v. Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the\ndefendant recently submited, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains\ngrand jury in a Manhatan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who\nanalyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and qualified jury wheels for Manhatan\nand White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains qualified jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror population\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror population of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 53o (l975). Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under the Sixth Amendment to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity applies to the grand jury that indicted her. See, e.g., United States v. Osorio, 8ol F.\nSupp. 966, 973-74 (D. Conn. l992) (rejecting argument that Sixth Amendment’s fair cross-\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2327", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l3\nsection protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 9 of l3\nStates v.

The only geographic nexus in this case to this\nDistrict—Epstein’s New York residence—is in the Manhatan Division, and the case will be\ntried within the Manhatan Division. The appropriate comparison here is therefore between the\nManhatan Division and the qualified wheel for White Plains.\n\nMr. Martin’s analysis found significant underrepresentation of both <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic\npersons in the White Plains qualified wheel when compared to the eligible juror population of\nthe Manhatan Division. Mr. Martin found that the eligible juror population of the Manhatan\nDivision is 2o.92% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and 28.o6% Hispanic (Martin Decl. § 2o), while the White Plans\nqualified wheel refilled in February 2ol7 (and thus in effect in 2o2o) was 8.76% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and\nlo.48% Hispanic (id. § 55). Thus, Mr. Martin found an “Absolute Disparity” of l2.l6%\nunderrepresentation for <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> jurors (2o.92% minus 8.76%) and an “Absolute Disparity” of\nl7.58% for Hispanic jurors (28.o6% minus lo.48%). Jd. J] 6l-62. Mr. Martin also found\nsignificant underrepresentation using a “Comparative Disparity” analysis (id. J] 69-7o), which\nreflects a cognizable group’s absolute disparity as a percentage of the population percentage of\nthat group, and a standard deviation analysis (id. [§ 74-75), which measures the statistical\nsignificance of a group’s underrepresentation.\n\nMr. Martin further found that there would be significant underrepresentation even if the\nWhite Plains qualified wheel were compared to the eligible juror population of the entire\nSouthern District of New York. For the whole District, the eligible juror population is l8.o9%\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and 23.4l% Hispanic. /d. § l9. Thus, when compared to the whole District, an absolute\ndisparity analysis of the White Plains qualified wheel shoued an underrepresentation of 9.33%\nfor <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> jurors and l2.93% for Hispanic jurors. /d.

Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing\nin the southern counties of this District.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the\nManhatan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison\npopulation by more than three standard deviations. Martin Decl. {fj 74-75. According to Mr.\nMartin, if there is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,\nthe divergence of demographics should exceed three deviations only approximately o.5% of the\ntime. /d. § 73. Thus, the underrepresentations here are “not the result of random factors, chance,\nor luck” but “the result of a systematic process that under represents” each group. /d. 9] 74-75.\nSee Jackman, 46 F.3d at l248 (finding fair cross-section violation due to systematic exclusion of\nresidents from communities with large minority populations).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo233o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page ll of l3\n\nThus, regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel is compared to the\neligible juror population of the Manhatan Division or that of the entire District, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and\nHispanic jurors are systematically underrepresented. Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima\nfacie shouing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.\n\nAccordingly, the government has the burden of shouing that atainment of a fair cross-\nsection would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot\ndo so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing\nCOVID-l9, it cannot shou that atainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible\nwith that interest. As noted above, a Manhatan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2o2o;\nthere appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell\non the anniversary of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until\nthat time.

Like Maxwell, the defendant in\nSchulte asserted, among other things, a claim under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution,\narguing that the indictment should be dismissed because the grand jury siting in White Plains\nunfairly underrepresented <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic individuals. Judge Croty rejected those claims in\ntheir entirety and denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Judge Croty’s thorough, well-\nreasoned decision supports the Government’s position in this case.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo282o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002828.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouReiehd FieebdR22e/?l Pafageor 26 2o\nsection challenges under both the Act and the sixth amendment, our discussion of the statutory\nchallenge also disposes of his constitutional claim.”). :\nIn addition to fair cross-section claims, a defendant may also assert other violations of the\nISSA if those violations constitute a “substantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. at :\n87o (cleaned up); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *4. “Mere technical violations” of the ISSA,\nhouever, are not actionable.

Fair Cross-Section Challenge |\nBecause Schulte’s fair cross-section claim arises under both the Sixth Amendment and\nthe ISSA, he must meet the three-part test set forth under Duren. See LaChance, 788 F.2d at |\nThe parties do not dispute that the first element under Duren has been satisfied. That |\nelement asks whether “the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”\nDuren, 439 U.S. at 364. Here, Schulte alleges that African American and Hispanic American |\njurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 7.) These groups have\nbeen recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (“Rioux has\nsatisfied the first prong of the Duren test: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”\ngroups for the purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 52o F.\nSupp.2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first element under\nDuren. The Court holds, houever, that Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements of\nthe Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be rejected.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2828", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002938.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 239\nVI.

Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January\n2ol8, the Government indicated to Boies Schiller that it intended to make document requests.\nBoies Schiller generally advised the Government that a protective order would govern some of the\nmaterials. (/d. at 3).\n\nIn or about February 2ol9, approximately two months after the USAO-SDNY opened its\ninvestigation (and almost three years after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting described above), the\nUSAO-SDNY issued two criminal grand jury subpoenas to Boies Schiller.

The Government has reviewed the file that AUSA-l provided to the prosecution team on or\nabout December 6, 2ol8 and understands, based on a review of that file, that at the February 2ol6\nmeeting, AUSA-l received copies of Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book, flight records, and Palm Beach Police\nDepartment reports. Although AUSA-l does not nou recall the atorneys providing her with any\ndocuments at the meeting (Ex. 4 at 2), an email she sent to the prosecution team on December 6,\n2ol8 refers to these documents as materials that the atorneys provided at the meeting.\n\nThe Government notes that as of March 7, 2ol6, one week after AUSA-l’s February 29,\n2ol6 meeting with the atorneys when she received these documents, Maxwell had only produced\ntwo emails in response to Giuffre’s discovery requests. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email.

(Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the\ndefendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.\n\na. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the community “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains Qualified Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 239\nhou the particular Master Wheel is selected. It says nothing about the process by which a Master\nWheel is reduced to the subset of qualified jurors contained in the Qualified Wheel. Because the\n“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains\nMaster Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 93o F. Supp. at l566-68.\n\nAlthough the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race\nand ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup\nof the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master\nWheel is ll.2o% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American and l2.97% Hispanic or Latino. (Siskin Aff. at §\n28). By contrast, the White Plains Qualified Wheel is 8.76% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American and\nlo.48% Hispanic or Latino. (/d. at § l7).\n\nThe community population for purposes of assessing representativeness is the population\neligible for jury service in the community. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 524 (l975)\n(focusing on population eligible for jury service); Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657 (“We conclude that the\nappropriate measure in this case is the eighteen and older subset of the population ....”). But hou\nshould the relevant “community” be defined? The defendant contends that it is the jury eligible\npopulation of the “Manhatan Division,” because that is where the offense occurred and where she\nassumes she will be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 6). As set forth above, she is wrong. The relevant\n°° The defense motion references the expert report of an expert witness named Jeffrey O’Neal\nMartin (“Martin Aff.”’), which was prepared for the defense in United States v. Balde, No. 2o Cr.\n28l (KPF), where a similar motion is currently pending before Judge Failla. The Government is\nlikewise ataching the expert report of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin, which was prepared for the\nGovernment in Balde. As detailed Dr. Skiskin’s report, geocoding is based on estimating the\nproportion of persons who are of a given race or ethnicity based on the racial and ethnic area in\nwhich they live. (See Affidavit of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin (“Siskin Aff.”), atached hereto as Exhibit\nl2, at § 26). BISG enhances the accuracy of geocoding for Hispanic or Latino persons by using\ninformation about persons’ last names.

(See Siskin Aff. at § l9; see also Martin Aff. at § 2l).\n\nOnce the relevant comparators are defined, an additional threshold question is the statistical\nmethod by which to compare them. Courts have applied different approaches over time, such as\nthe statistical decision theory, the comparative disparity theory, and the absolute disparity theory.\nSee Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655. Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis v. Smith, 559 U.S. 3l4,\n329 (2olo), the Second Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored\nand strongly suggested that the absolute disparity theory is generally appropriate, see Rioux, 97\nF.3d at 655-56; see also United States v. Barnes, 52o F. Supp. 2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“[T]he\nabsolute disparity approach is the primary approach used in this Circuit.”’).\n\nThe “absolute disparity” approach measures the absolute numerical difference between the\ndistinctive group’s representation in the community population and the group’s representation in\nthe relevant jury pool. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655; United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l, 3o-\n3l (E.D.N.Y. 2olo), affd 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir. 2ol2). For example, if Blacks\nrepresented lo% of the community population but only 2% of the relevant jury pool, the “absolute\ndisparity” would be 8%.\n\nThere is no specific numerical threshold that constitutes unacceptable disparity under the\n“absolute disparity” method. “[P]erfectly proportional representation is not required, since no\nThe American Community Survey gathers demographic information in between the decennial\ncensus, and is published by the United States Census Bureau.

Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\nselection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244. See also id. at l252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at\nodds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).\n\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 4o; see also United States v. Barlou, 479 F.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 348\nforward with charges in this case.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\n\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\nconclusion, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited. More importantly, I believe there is\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3246", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp://www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ceforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 84 of 348\nLILLY ANN SANCHEZ, Esq.\nAUGUST 3, 2oo7\nPAGE 2\nPlease let us knou your client's decision by no later than August l7.

Alexander Acosta\nJeffrey Sloman\nAndrew Louric\nA. Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 348\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys.

On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months. He should be spending l8 years in jail.”\n\nAcosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer\ncongratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs. <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>,\nl76 Plea Hearing Transcript at 2o, 42.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'™* <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 348\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'*’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case] ....

The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

Jackman,\n46 F.3d l24o, l24l (2d Cir. l995) (referring to “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will use the terms “Manhatan\nCounties” and “White Plains Counties” here.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3767", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page7oflil\nsiting in the same community where the case will be tried avoids a situation where one\ncommunity charges the defendant but a different community tries her—a situation that is\nparticularly fraught with fair cross-section concerns in an area such as New York City, where the\ndemographic composition of communities can vary dramatically. See also Declaration of Jeffrey\nMartin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v. Balde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt.

Here,\nthat is either the Manhatan Counties or the Southern District. Since the government does not\ndispute that when a comparison to either community is used, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic jurors are\nsignificantly underrepresented in the White Plains jury pool, the second Duren prong is met.”\n\nI. The Underrepresentation Resulted from Systematic Exclusion.\n\nContrary to the government’s contention, its decision to seek an indictment from a White\nPlains grand jury constitutes the “systematic exclusion . . . in the jury-selection process” required\nto satisfy the third Duren prong. See Duren, 439 US. at 364. “There is systematic exclusion\n* The government’s contention that the relevant jury pool to be measured against the comparison community is the\nWhite Plains master wheel rather than the White Plains qualified wheel, even if accepted, does not change the\noutcome. The government’s expert concedes that “the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury\nwheel will be significantly demographically different” from the juror populations of the Manhatan Counties and the\nSouthern District. Opp. Ex. l2 {4o (emphasis added). See also Martin Decl. {J l9-2l (shouing substantial\nunderrepresentations in eligible juror populations of White Plains vis-a-vis Manhatan Counties and Southern\nDistrict, including l3.94% underrepresentation of Hispanics when compared to Manhatan Counties and 9.29%\nunderrepresentation for Hispanics when compared to Southern District). In any event, the White Plains qualified\nwheel is the appropriate jury pool, as fair-cross-section motions concern the actual “venires from which juries are\nselected.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364; see also Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 538 (l975) ( [T]he jury wheels,\npools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in\nthe community.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003771.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page8ofll\nwhen the underrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external\nforces.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District community with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct. Opp. l99 n.68;\nsee also Jackman, 46 F.3d at l24l (finding violation even in a discarded “process that had\ninadvertently, but systematically, excluded from petit jury venires all residents of Hartford and\nNew Britain, communities with large minority populations”).\n\nThe government’s reliance on United States v. Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\nconvicted of felonies led to the erroneous exclusion of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42. This case, houever, is “like\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003772.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page9ofll\nJackman” (and unlike Barlou): The underrepresentation occurred because the government used\na White Plains grand jury knouing that doing so would significantly reduce the diversity of the\npool of jurors.\n\nThus, the government’s assertion that its decision to use a White Plains grand jury “has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected” (Opp. 2ll) is simply\nincorrect. By choosing to seek an indictment in White Plains, the government chose a grand jury\nselection process guaranteed to draw from a pool that would underrepresent <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> and Hispanic\njurors via-a-vis the Manhatan Counties and the Southern District.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4332", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 53 of 349\nforward with charges in this case. Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. I am going\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.

The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time I do. The\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\nnot sending that yet.\n\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\n\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3’ Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo435o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 62 of 349\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7l of 349\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand. After that concern was brought to my atention several\nmonths ago, I have tried very hard to be cognizant of the chain of\ncommand. ... If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\n\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment. Perhaps that lack of direction is through no fault of\nyours, but I have been dealing with a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> box, so I do not knou to\nwhom I should address my frustration. My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims. If the case is not going to go forward, I think it is unfair to\ngive hope to more girls.\n\nAs far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregone\nconclusion, I don’t knou of any case in the Office where an\ninvestigation has been opened with the plan NOT to indict. And I\nhave never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a\ndeclination. I didn’t treat this case any differently. I worked with\nthe agents to gather the evidence, and I prepared an indictment\npackage that I believe establishes probable cause that a series of\ncrimes have been commited. More importantly, I believe there is\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4368", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA. July 3l, 2oo7: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which\n\nMakes a Counteroffer\n\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein atorneys\nLefcourt, Sanchez, and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> on July 3l, 2oo7, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the\nUSAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing\nguidelines calculation shouing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of\nl88 to 235 months’ incarceration.\n\nVillafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s atorneys opposed the requirement of\nsexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein\nserve a sentence of home confinement or “community control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and\nemphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained\n92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the leter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do\nwith his impending departure from the USAO.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4382", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 87 of 349\njurisdiction), while making clear that we are not talking about the\ndetails of the case, and (i) asking [CEOS Chief] Oosterba[an] to\nparticipate by teleconference, thereby intercepting the DC meeting.\nThoughts?\nAcosta told OPR that he had no concern about Departmental “scrutiny of the NPA scheme” and\nthat “[i]f anything,” he was concerned whether the Department might direct the USAO to “drop\nthis case.””°\n2. Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l23 of 349\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l37 of 349\n\nOn Monday, June 23, 2oo8, Roth sent a brief leter to Starr and Lefkouitz informing them\nthat the office had “completed a thorough review” of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater\nand did not believe intervention by the Deputy Atorney General was warranted in view of the\n“considerable discretion” vested by the Department in U.S. Atorneys. He added, “Even if we\nwere to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Atorney, we believe that federal prosecution\nof this case is appropriate.”\n\nImmediately after receiving a copy of Roth’s leter, Villafafia notified defense counsel that\nEpstein would have until close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the NPA\nby entering his guilty plea, being sentenced, and surrendering to begin serving his sentence. On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While Iam obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost. ...

JUNE 2oo8 — JUNE 2oo9: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS\n\nCUSTODIAL SENTENCE\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local atorneys\nGoldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> for a copy of the state plea agreement reached with the State Atorney’s\nOffice, noting that their failure to provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.’”!””\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l42 of 349\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*?

Villafafia reminded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.!* Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.'®* <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,’” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl88 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4439", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l45 of 349\ncooperation.'° When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA. In August 2oo9, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of\nhis home detention—he had been spoted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,\nhe claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home.

Three months later, Sloman met with\nDershouitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of\nEpstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s\nsupervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on\nJuly 2l, 2olo.\nl86 See “Out of Prison,” New York Post, July 23, 2oo9.\nl87 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case]....

Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court.

Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up).

If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the Commonwealth,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A.

Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the Commonwealth for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 73 of 8o\ndo just that, D.A. Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing <span class=\"highlight\">BLACK</span>’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv.

As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7).

See Dkt.

See id. And more generally, the request for production of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for discovery from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for inspection; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\nrelevance as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page3oflo\n\nAs previously detailed, Annie Farmer is believed to be the alleged victim referred to in\nthe superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented by BSF. See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\nproduction of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, <span class=\"highlight\">black</span>\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a\nsubpoena, atached as Exhibit l, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also\nproposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.' Inspection\nof each of these items in advance of trial is necessary for the reasons set forth in the Ms.\nMaxwell’s First Motion.\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event that BSF\nclaims the physical items are not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (and are in the\npossession of) their client. The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI write to confirm that November l5, 2o2l is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an\nalleged victim’s sexual behavior.\nUnder this Court’s pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October l8. A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page l2 of 69\n\nC. The Court Should Reject the Government’s Atempts to Preview any Defense\n\nCase or Cross Examination\n\nUnless and until the prosecution has established its prima facie case, the defendant “‘is not\ncalled upon to determine whether to produce documents and material normally privileged. It\nimposes a price on the exercise of a constitutional right to require a pre-trial decision of the trial\ntactics which are normally determined by a defense lawyer follouing the completion of the\nprima facie case.” United States v. Fratello, 44 F.R.D. 444, 452 (S.D.N-Y. l968). Moreover, the\ndecision to prosecute someone criminally carries with it certain consequences:\n\nUnder our constitutional system, a criminal defendant—need not do anything at all\n\nto defend himself, and certainly he cannot be required to help convict himself.\n\nRather he has an absolute, unqualified right to compel the State to investigate its\n\noun case, find its oun witnesses, prove its oun facts, and convince the jury through\n\nits oun resources. Throughout the process the defendant has a fundamental right to\n\nremain silent, in effect challenging the State at every point to: “Prove it!”\n\nUnited States v. Wilkerson, 388 F. Supp. 3d 969, 972 (E.D. Tenn. 2ol9) (quoting Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U.S. 78, ll2 (l97o) (<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, J., dissenting)).\n\nMuch of the government’s argument is directed at causing the defense to provide a\npreview of its strategy and the substance of defense cross examination which should be rejected\nby the Court.\n\nI. THE GOVERNMENT’S PSEUDONYM TACTIC IS UNNECESSARY,\n\nUNWORKABLE, AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THIS CASE\n\nThe government proposes various false or partial names for some of the accusers and\nwitnesses.

During one\nof those meetings, the Government shoued Minor Victim-4 a photo book containing 2o photos.\nThe Government asked Minor Victim-4 to review each photograph in the book and to indicate\nwhether she recognized anyone in the book.

By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the photograph she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed.

Accordingly, photographs that corroborate Jane’s testimony are highly relevant.\n\nThere are two sets of photographs that are particularly corroborative: photographs of\nEpstein’s massage room and photographs that corroborate details of other portions of Epstein’s\nhouse.\n\nA. The Massage Room\n\nJane testified that she was sexually abused in the massage room of Epstein’s New York\nhouse, and she gave detailed testimony about permanent features of the room. Photographs taken\nof the massage room specifically corroborate that testimony.”\n\nJane described the walls of the room: “[I]t was very dark,” “I don’t knou if it was painted\ndark, but — or maybe that was the lighting, but it sort of had this, like, red mood. And then there\nwas just a giant <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> massage table in the middle of it.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).

Why and when the government conducted the\n\n3 investigation is not relevant. If the defense believes the\n\n4 government has a legally improper motive for prosecuting\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell or somehou fabricating evidence or suborning\n\n6 perjury or the like, the Second Circuit has made clear that the\n7 proper remedy is to file a motion for the Court to consider.\n\n8 See, Regan, lo3 F.3d lo82. Absent that, the law is clear that\n9 for purposes of the jury, \"the government is not on trial.\"\n\nlo United States v. Knox, 687 F.App'x 5l, (2d Cir. 2ol7).\n\nll Moreover, evidence of motive would be highly\n\nl2 prejudicial. For the reasons I explained a moment ago, it\n\nl3 would confuse jurors as to the proper standard of guilt to be\nl4 applied in the case. Indeed, the defense's outlined evidence\nl5 of improper motives is strongly suggestive of jury\n\nl6 nullification because it suggests a vindictive or political\n\nl7 prosecution which is rightly a mater reserved to the Court.\n\nl8 Calling witnesses to testify to the government's\n\nl9 motive would substantially expand the scope of trial, rely\n2o likely on hearsay and other inadmissible evidence. So what\n2l motivated a particular investigative step or charging decision\n22 of course doesn't have a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> or white answer, and the defense\n23 would have one story and the government another, neither of\n24 which would assist of the jury in deciding Ms. Maxwell's guilt\n25 or innocence of the charges here based on of the government's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009173.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l5-l Filed o2/24/22 Page5of6\nJane’s story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who\nremembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.\n\nThe accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on\n\nat least one flight with Maxwell, David said.\n\nTheir stories were backed up by Maxwell's “litle <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book” — an address\n\nbook found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseuses”\n\nincluding Jane and Carolyn.\n\nDavid said the litle <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book also gave the jurors clues about hou\n\nMaxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past.

David said there just wasn’t any\n\ndirect evidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice\n\nJane to get on those flights.\n\n“T personally was willing to find her guilty on count two,” he said. “But we\n\nall decided in the end that there wasn’t enough evidence.”\n\nDavid also explained that he was convinced by the closeness of Maxwell\n\nand Epstein’s relationship and the key role she played in his life.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009244.jpg": "Case F2o5cl-oo88o; PAEum Butea ene 64o.

(/d.). The defendant told Carolyn\nthat she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for\nmassages. (PSR § 7l). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to massage Epstein, including\nmultiple minors. (/d.). When Carolyn brought girls to massage Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn\nwould be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and\ntouched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and butocks. (/d.).\n\n6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa\n\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was\nnamed Melissa. (PSR { 8o). Melissa was just l6 years old when she went with Carolyn to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein\nwith massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of l8. (/d.). When Melissa and\nCarolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then\nreturned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s\nfriend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia\n(parents)” were listed in the defendant and Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> address book under the heading\n“Massage — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began\nwith Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.\n\nII. The Pre-Sentence Report and Sentencing Guidelines\n\nThe United States Probation Office, in its Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, recommends\na sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. In making that recommendation, the Probation Office\ncharacterized the defendant’s offense conduct as “heinous and predatory in nature.” (PSR at 67).\nRegarding the defendant’s role, the Probation Office emphasized that “[t]he gravity of Maxwell’s\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”).

Alessi worked for Epstein at his Palm Beach house from\napproximately l99o until approximately 2oo2. Alessi has explained that, during his employment,\nhe observed a contact book with a dark blue or <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> cover, which cover was blank, and with many\nentries printed in <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> ink on white paper. See 35o4-o46.

Alessi observed both the defendant and Epstein use the contact book.\n\nWhen the Government shoued Alessi Government Exhibit 52 tonight, Alessi recognized\nit as a copy of the contact book he had previously described. See 35o4-o47. Alessi identified the\nbook by the cover, binding, formating, and variation in the entries.

That includes the entry for the witness testifying as “Jane,” see GX 52-F,\nand the entry for Florida masseuses—including some of the individuals on that list, see GX 52-G.\nAlthough this version of the contact book post-dates his employment with Epstein, Alessi was able\nto determine that fact in part by noticing that his oun contact information had been removed from\nthe book.’\n\nD Alesel alae explained that thane were two similar-looking books, one for Epstein and one for the\ndefendant.\n3 Alessi generally recalls the book being thicker and featuring a larger font size.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI write to confirm that November l5, 2o2l is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an\nalleged victim’s sexual behavior.\nUnder this Court’s pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October l8. A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c)(l)(B) (providing that a defendant must file\nher motion “at least l4 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time”).\nDOJ-OGR-oooll265", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page5loflol 5l\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl addressing the factual objections speak directly to this issue.\n2 The record at trial amply established that Melissa and Virginia\n3 were victims of this conspiracy, and that the defendant had\n\n4 been involved with recruiting Virginia, who in turn recruited\n\niy Carolyn, who in turn recruited Melissa.\n\n6 With respect to Melissa in particular, we would not\n\n7 that, like Virginia, her name appears in the defendant's litle\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book, noting that she's a friend of Carolyn's.

They\n\nl3 maintained a coercive relationship with her into her early\n\nl4 twenties.\n\nl5 Nou, I've already talked about some of the ways that\nl6 Jane's testimony was corroborated. I want to talk to you nou\nl7 about the many other ways that Jane's testimony is backed up by\nl8 all of the other evidence in this case.\n\nl9 First, you heard from Juan Alessi, who remembered\n2o Jane. Here's his testimony about that. He remembered that she\n2l looked about l4 or l5, and that she spent time with Maxwell and\n22 Epstein at the house. Here's his testimony about that: Alessi\n23 remembered the school that Jane went to because he would be\n24 sent to pick her up there sometimes.

But\n4 here's the thing, Jane never testified that Michelle Healey and\n5 Eva Dubin were in the room when she was abused. She did not\n\n6 say that.\n\n7 Defense counsel asked her about a Michelle and an Eva.\n8 They expressly did not ask Jane if she knew those people's last\n9 names. They didn't shou Jane pictures of Eva Dubin or Michelle\nlo Healey to see if those were the people she was referencing.\n\nll They left it really vague on purpose. But trying to discredit\nl2 Jane this way makes no sense.

That's the <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> contact book. Remember, there\n\nl7 were pages from Epstein and Maxwell's contact book, and we're\nl8 going to talk more about this book later. But you're going to\nl9 see this book had another Eva in it and three Michelles. Of\n2o course there were other Michelles and Evas out there and other\n2l people with those names in Epstein's life. Calling these women\n22 to testify was completely meaningless and it was a total\n23 sideshou. Don't be distracted by that.

Carolyn\n\nl6 testified that this was her mother's phone number. She wrote\nl7 it doun so she wouldn't have to say it out loud at trial, and\nl8 we marked it as an exhibit. That same phone number is all over\nl9 the message pads from the Palm Beach house, phone message after\n2o message.\n2l This is Government Exhibit l-B. It's the same phone\n22 number, and that's Carolyn's full name, first and last. It's\n23 from 2oo4. And remember, we were just looking at FedEx records\n24 from 2oo2. What's the message here?

And what the manual shous you is that Maxwell and\n\n5 Epstein had a phone directory, and they kept several copies of\n6 it in the house. There was a copy in the pool area, there was\n7 a copy in their cars, there was a copy of it in the master\n\n8 bedroom, and most importantly, there was a copy right on\n\n9 Maxwell's desk.\n\nlo Here's the part of the manual that tells you that.\n\nll There was a copy on her desk.

Here it is. So the section on this\nl8 page is titled \"Massage Florida.\" I'm going to highlight a few\nl9 specific entries in a moment, but first let's just start with\n2o the basics.

This\n\nl2 document is pouerful evidence of the defendant's knouledge and\nl3 intent. These were not real massages. What was happening was\nl4 sexual abuse with underage girls.

What Judge Nathan says\n2o about the law controls here.\n2l First, I want to talk to you about something called\n22 aiding and abeting. For counts Two, Four, and Six, which\n23 we're going to discuss in just a moment, Maxwell is guilty if\n24 she commited those crimes herself, but you can also find her\n25 guilty under an aiding and abeting theory.

And if\n7 Epstein was in the house, he would never go to Ghislaine, he\n\n8 would go directly to Epstein.\n\n9 And let's talk a litle bit about Mr. Alessi.\n\nlo Mr. Alessi worked for Epstein for many years.

In fact, I think she called it a truly\nl4 awful job. So we knou the two of them weren't geting along.\nl5 But does being a tough boss make you an enforcer of a\nl6 code of silence? Mr. Alessi is simply not credible. He said\nl7 he didn't follou the household manual, which is dated years\n\nl8 later. He threw it away. Not one employee told you they\n\nl9 folloued this household manual.\n2o He's also the one that the government tried to get in\n2l this litle <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> address book from, right?

He told you a story that he concocted to make\nl6 himself look beter. He told you that he broke into Epstein's\nl7 home one time to try to help someone because he was out of\n\nl8 money. But he told the police back in 2oo3 that he broke in to\nl9 steal a gun.\n2o He told you he stole the money because he needed it,\n2l but then he told you he ouned multiple rental properties. He\n22 told you he broke in once. But the truth was, as he told the\n23 police in 2oo3, he broke in twice.

She told both of them hou\n\nl3 Maxwell touched her breasts during a massage. Jane told Mat,\nl4 her boyfriend from a decade ago, about the woman who would make\nl5 her feel comfortable in the room. Carolyn mentioned meeting\n\nl6 the woman with short <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> hair and an accent to the FBI in\n\nl7 2oo7. She mentioned Maxwell twice in her deposition, and she\nl8 told Sean that she saw Maxwell at the house at that time, way\nl9 before there was a compensation fund or any incentive to add in\n2o Maxwell if it wasn't true.\n2l And that timing is crucial here because it completely\n22 guts the whole defense theory.

Judge Engelmayer and Hon. Judge Berman:\n\nI have been taken aback from all the monumental and more recently disheartening things\nthat have taken place between the time Epstein was arrested, the trial that occurred verse\nMaxwell with Hon. Judge Alison Nathan and nou with the leter I write to you today.\n\nThis is all very exhausting. As a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the\nco-conspirators who were never indicted, you can try to imagine the bewilderment I feel from the\nthe latest happenings. Also, the news that came out today in regards to potentially releasing audio\nof the interview between Maxwell and Todd Blanche and the various subpoenas.\n\nI think the more concerning thing to me are the subpoena’s. Why not subpoena the United States\nVirgin Island’s officials that were working with Epstein to allou him to further his sex-\ntrafficking of girls across inter-continental and international lines? “Jeffrey Epstein used the\nmoney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands.” [htps://\nwww.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/follouing-new-epstein-revelations-wyden-\nrenews-demand-for-trump-administration-to-produce-epstein-files]\nWhy not subpoena the long-time atorney and accountant Epstein had working by his side? Once .\nagain, I just feel like the direction this administration is going is all wrong. AND, what was it\nthat his accountant took from his 7lst Street NY mansion the day after he “killed himself’?\nhtps ://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-74989o3/Executor-Epsteins-estate-removed-bag-\npedophiles-mansion-day-killed-himself- html\nIn terms of the audio file that will most likely be redacted once again scrubbing the names of the\nwealthy and such off the recordings is once again NOT transparency. Unfortunately, the public\nwill never be satisfied and the victims will continue to live this nightmare.

It ended on December 29, 2o2l, with Maxwell’s conviction on five of the\nsix counts and her acquital on the substantive enticement count.\n\nThe evidence adduced at trial is well-summarized in Judge Nathan’s post-trial decision\ndenying Maxwell’s post-trial motions, including under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29\nfor a judgment of acquital, Dkt. 657; in the Government’s brief in Maxwell’s appeal, see United\nStates v. Maxwell, No. 22-l426 (2d Cir. June 29, 2o23), Dkt. 79; and in the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in that appeal, see United States v. Maxwell, ll8 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2o24).\n\nIn brief, the Government’s evidence included the testimony of four women who\ndescribed the sexual abuse they had suffered, as girls, at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell; the\ntestimony of individuals who worked for Epstein and Maxwell; the testimony of law\nenforcement officials; corroborating physical evidence, including photographs of and evidence\nrecovered from searches of Epstein’s residences, and Epstein’s and Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> address\nbook; and other corroborating records, such as flight logs of Epstein’s private planes and FedEx\nrecords.\n\nThe trial evidence focused on six girls, including the four testifying victims, who suffered\nabusive sexual contact as a result of Maxwell’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn,\nVirginia, and Melissa. It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately\ndecade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young\nwomen and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. Maxwell helped identify\nvulnerable girls for abuse, targeting those who faced difficult family circumstances, including\n3 On April l6, 2o2l, Judge Nathan granted Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury charges.\n\nDkt. 2o7. After Maxwell’s sentencing, the Government moved to dismiss these counts, in light\nof victims’ interests in closure and avoiding the trauma of testifying again. Judge Nathan\ngranted that motion.

Here's his testimony about that. He remembered that she\n2l looked about l4 or l5, and that she spent time with Maxwell and\n22 Epstein at the house.

She did not\n\n6 say that.\n\n7 Defense counsel asked her about a Michelle and an Eva.\n8 They expressly did not ask Jane if she knew those people's last\n9 names. They didn't shou Jane pictures of Eva Dubin or Michelle\nlo Healey to see if those were the people she was referencing.\n\nll They left it really vague on purpose.

And what the manual shous you is that Maxwell and\n\n5 Epstein had a phone directory, and they kept several copies of\n6 it in the house. There was a copy in the pool area, there was\n7 a copy in their cars, there was a copy of it in the master\n\n8 bedroom, and most importantly, there was a copy right on\n\n9 Maxwell's desk.\n\nlo Here's the part of the manual that tells you that.\n\nll There was a copy on her desk.

Here it is. So the section on this\nl8 page is titled \"Massage Florida.\" I'm going to highlight a few\nl9 specific entries in a moment, but first let's just start with\n2o the basics.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “<span class=\"highlight\">black</span> eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020872.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page46 of 22l\nA-246\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6l5-l Filed o2/24/22 Page 5 of 6\nJane’s story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who\nremembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.\nThe accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on\nat least one flight with Maxwell, David said.\nTheir stories were backed up by Maxwell's “litle <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book” — an address\nbook found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseuses”\nincluding Jane and Carolyn.\nDavid said the litle <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> book also gave the jurors clues about hou\nMaxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past. There were\nnames of several Palm Beach police officers listed on a first-name basis in\nthat book, David said.\n“Those girls’ names and phone numbers were listed next to the words\n‘mom’ and ‘dad*” he said. “Professional masseuses do not need their\nparents with them.”\nMany speculated that the jury chose to acquit Maxwell on count two\nbecause that count related solely to Jane. and that Jane was less credible\nthan other victims.\nBut David told The Independent that wasn't the case.\n“We simply didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two,”\nhe said. “It wasn’t about not believing Jane.”\nCount two was a substantive charge that required proof that Maxwell\n“enticed” Jane to travel across state lines. David said there just wasn’t any\ndirect evidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice\nJane to get on those flights.\n“T personally was willing to find her guilty on count two.” he said. “But we\nall decided in the end that there wasn’t enough evidence.”\nDavid also explained that he was convinced by the closeness of Maxwell\nand Epstein’s relationship and the key role she played in his life.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021054.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page7 of ll3\n\nHudson Valley <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> Press v.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021226.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NR 3536o38, Paged4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 52 of 348\n\nforward with charges in this case. Lourie forwarded a copy of the prosecution memorandum to\nMenchel. Lourie’s transmital message read:\n\nMarie did a 5o [sic] page pros memo in the Epstein case. Iam going\n\nto start reading it tonight. ... It’s a major case because the target is\n\none of the richest men in the country and it has been big news.

The state intentionally torpedoed it in the\n\ngrand jury so it was brought to us. I am going to forward the pros\n\nmemo to you so you can start reading it at the same time Ido. The\n\nFBI is pushing to do it in Mid [sic] May, which I think is not critical,\n\nbut we might as well get a jump on it. I have some ideas about the\n\nindictment (needs to be ultra lean with only clean victims), so I am\n\nnot sending that yet.\nLourie explained to OPR that by “clean” victims, he meant those for whom the defense did not\nhave impeachment evidence to use against them.\n\nA few days later, Lourie emailed Menchel, asking if Menchel had read the prosecution\nmemorandum. Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.37 Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get ano-bill on this... and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\nat In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021235.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON eL 3536o38, Page63 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021244.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/2 of 258\nSA-7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

My recollection of the\noriginal meeting with Alex and Jeff is quite different than your\nsummary. In that meeting, I summarized the case and the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of it. I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation. I said that I was willing to invest that time and the\nFBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t want to get to the\nend and then have the Office be intimidated by the high-pouered.\nlawyers. I was assured that that would not happen. Nou I feel like\nthere is a glass ceiling that prevents me from moving forward while\nevidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage in this\ncriminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI has identified two more\nvictims.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021254.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8o 3536o38, Page82 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8o of 348\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\nA.

Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying ... to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021296.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel24 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\n\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

On\nJune 26, 2oo8, Roth alerted the Office of the Atorney General that Epstein’s counsel might try to\ncontact the Atorney General to request additional review and urged the Atorney General not to\ntake defense counsel’s calls. Roth told OPR that he was concerned that Epstein’s team would try\nto take a further appeal in order to delay resolution of the case.\n\nMeanwhile, Starr sent a concluding email to Acosta, acknouledging they had reached “the\nend of a long and arduous road” and adding, “While I am obviously very unhappy at what I believe\nis the government’s treatment of my client, aman whom I have come to deeply admire, I recognize\nthat we have filed and argued our ‘appellate motions’ and lost....

Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”'”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\nie The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021315.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAT 3536o38, Pagel43 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4l of 348\nfor up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*?

Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger.

Since the FBI and the Justice Department\ninspector General are looking into the Epstein case she said she could not speak about any specifics.\n“We have some bad staff,” Hawk Sawyer said. \"We want rid of those bed staff who don’t do theirjob. We want them gone one way or another either by\nprosecution or by termination. But the good staff are doing extraordinary work out there every day managing the l77,ooo inmates. You never hear anything\nabout those people.”\nBy Courtney Buble\nNovember l9, 2ol9\nhtps:/Avww.govexec.com/oversight/2ol 9/l #ack-staff-and-resources-continue-strain-federal-bureau-prisons/l6l396/\n\nhitps:/www, govexec. convover sight2ol9/ ll flack-staif-and-resources-oontinue-strain-federal-bureau-prisons/ 6l398/priny! 22\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022170.jpg": "SOD-NY-3o2757l\n\nType(s}:lB, lD, lE\n\nItem # Type Description\n\nl8l46 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: NYCO32395 - One (l)DVD-R containing image log files and FTK reports for system information on selected items.\n\nlBl45 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCO3239l - Three (3} LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l94o7.\n\nlBl44 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCo32392 - Two(2) LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l5974.\n\nlBl43 Digital (U} one (l} CD labelled \"girl pics nude book 4\"\n\nlBl42 Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l) Envelope containing l VHS tape, 2 cassete tapes & 4 micro cassete tapes\n\nlBl4l Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l} Envelope containing 4 CD's\n\nlBl4o General (U} (2} Bankers box containing various EPSTEIN related case materials\n\nlBl39 General (U} ONE BOX CONTAINING: One pair of <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> women's couboy boots, size 8\n\nlBl38 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: Disk containing images of Matchmaker shred reconstruction\n\nlBl37 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING: (l} un-framed photo.\n\nlBl36 Digital (U//FOUO) ONE RED ROPE containing: Highly confidential responsive material to include nude and semi nude images and videos from digital evidence items processed by CART.\n\nlBl35 General (U} Box containing Ten yearbooks collected by FBI West Palm Beach Resident Agency\n\nlBl34 General (U} One (l} peach massage table.\n\nlBl33 General (U} One (l} green massage table (PBPDO5-lo24}.\n\nlBl32 General (U} One (l} beige massage table.\n\nlBl3l General (U} One (l} broun massage table.\n\nlBl3o General (U} One flat box containing one (l} large framed photo.\n\nlBl29 General (U} One box containing four (4) framed photos.\n\nlBl28 General (U} One box containing twelve (l2) framed photos.\n\nlBl27 General (U} One box containing five (5} framed photos\n\nlBl26 General (U} One red rope containing: LSJ logbook\n\nlBl25 General (U} One red rope containing:Daily Vessel Trip logs Feb 2, 2ol7 - Feb l6, 2ol7\n\nlBl24 Digital (U) HP Touer S/N: CNV742l3M3 Model: 57o-po56\n\nlBl23 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: l833o6G2UMJXEKGX\n\nlBl22 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: MJO7YG6U Machine type: 9oJo\n\nlBl2l Digital (U} Mac DesktopS/N: W89524CZSPJ model Al3l2\n\nlBl2o Digital (U) HP TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo4Y Model #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll9 Digital (U} HP Desktop TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo5oModel #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll8 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktop\n\nlBll7 Digital (U) 6 Bay with l46GB drivesS/N: MXQ824AlR\n\nlBll6 Digital (U} One box containing Panasonic KX-TDElooS/N: KX-TDAOlo49LCCDoo5398\n\nlBll5 Digital (U} HP server with (4} 5oo GB drivesS/N: MXQ322ol87\n\nlBll4 General (U} Blue prints\n\nlBll3 General (U} One cellophane containing:Boat trip log & employee lists\n\nlBll2 Digital (U) Unifi serverMacID: l735K788A2o463234-8uuU9FF CCID: SWX-UASPRO\n\nlBll Digital (U) Unifi videoM/N: UVC-NVR-2TBMaclD: l829FB4FBE426EA9o\n\nlBllo General (U} One cellophane containing:Paper with passwords on both sides\n\nlBlo9 Digital (U) Unifi Cloud keyM/N: UN-CKFCCID: SWX-UCCKIC 6545A-UCCKMac ID: l843KB4FBE4D3oC69-dcRgm9\n\nlBlo8 Digital (U} CELLOPHANE containing Olympus Digital Voice Recorder\n\nlBlo7 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktopModel #: Al3llS/N: W8o4736DDAS\n\nlBlo6 Digital (U} Dell Inspiron touer with pouer cordReg Model: DI9MQCHFA335\n\nlBlo5 General (U} One red rope containing:LSJ & GSJ Boat Log 2ol9\n\nlBlo4 General (U} Box containing Shredded paper\n\nlBlo3 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING;

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023064.jpg": "forward with charges in this case.

Lourie directed Menchel’s atention to particular pages of the prosecution\nmemorandum, noting that the “keys” were whether the USAO could prove that Epstein traveled\nfor the purpose of engaging in sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told Epstein they\nwere l8.3” Lourie asked for Menchel’s “very general opinion as to whether this is a case you think\nthe office should do,” and reminded Menchel that the State Atorney’s Office “went out of their\nway to get a no-bill on this . . . and thus only charged adult solicitation, which they would bargain\naway to nothing.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Menchel said that Lourie’s email transmiting the prosecution\nmemorandum was his “official introduction” to the case and at that point in time, he had never\nheard of Epstein and had no information about his background. He recalled that the USAO had\nbeen asked to review the case because the state had not handled it appropriately. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that he had litle memory about the facts of the case or what contemporaneous\nopinions he formed about it.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he could not recall whether he ever read Villafafia’s prosecution\nmemorandum, explaining that he “would typically rely on senior staff,’ who had more\nprosecutorial experience, and that instead of reading the memorandum, he may have discussed the\ncase with Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, who he assumed would have read the document. Acosta\n37 In various submissions to the USAO, the defense contended that the federal statute required proof that\nengaging in a sexual act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s travel, but that Epstein’s travel was\nmotivated by his desire to live outside of New York for over half of each year for tax purposes. The defense also\nasserted that the federal statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the victims were under l8, but that\nEpstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman was at least l8 years of age.” In her prosecution\nmemorandum, houever, Villafafia set forth her conclusion that the statute only required proof that engaging in a sexual\nact was one of the motivating factors for the travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the\ndefendant knew the victims were minors.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o64", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023073.jpg": "Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\nms Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n“4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023082.jpg": "e-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

If there is a particular instance of violating the chain\nof command that you would like to discuss, I would be happy to\ndiscuss it with you.\nThe statement that I have not respected Alex’s position regarding\nthe prosecution of the case demonstrates why you hear the\nfrustration in the tone of my e-mail. For two and a half months I\nhave been asking about what that position is. I have asked for\ndirection on whether to revise the indictment, whether there are\nother issues that Alex wants addressed prior to deciding, whether\nthere is additional investigation that needs to be done, etc. None of\nthat direction has been forthcoming, so I am left with . . . victims,\nand agents all demanding to knou why we aren’t presenting an\nindictment.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\n\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.”\n\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\n\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>.\nie The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023092.jpg": "the period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\na Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

Marie Villafafia\n\nMenchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for\nnegotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more\njail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by\nretaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him\ninto a federal penitentiary.” The leter’s deadline of August l7, 2oo7, for acceptance of the\ngovernment’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide\nher with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s\nassistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if\nEpstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August l7 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f\nyou tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the\nleter on Friday, August 3, 2oo7, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law\nfirm.”\n\nThe follouing Monday, August 6, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new\nfirm to inquire whether the leter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday.

Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them.

After receiving\nand reviewing the plea agreement form, which was not yet signed, Villafafia sent another leter to\nGoldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, informing them that the proposed sentencing provision did not comply with\nthe requirements of the NPA. Specifically, as writen, the plea agreement called for a sentence of\nl2 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” folloued consecutively by “l8 months\nCommunity Control” with a special condition that the defendant serve “the first 6 months [of\ncommunity control] in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility.” Villafafia objected to the\ncommunity control provision, reminding Goldberger and <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that the NPA required Epstein to\n“make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment, which means confinement\ntwenty-four hours a day at the County Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia recounted\nthat she had spoken about the issue with Goldberger, who “‘swore’ that Epstein would be in\ncustody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement portion of his sentence.” Villafafia\nadded that Goldberger “let it slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade\n.... Since we specifically discussed this at the meeting with [the State Atorney] months ago that\nEpstein would be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit of the [NPA] agreement.”!”\nVillafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells very bad.”\n\nV2 The Main Detention Center for Palm Beach County is a facility housing maximum, medium, and minimum\ncustody adult males, as well as juvenile and special population male and female inmates.

Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.” The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff's Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff's Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023153.jpg": "for up to l2 hours per day, six days per week, to work at the “Florida Science Foundation” office\nin West Palm Beach.'*? In mid-November 2oo8, Villafafia learned that Epstein was on work\nrelease. She notified Acosta, Sloman, and the USAO Criminal Division Chief of this development\nin an email, and asked, “Can I indict him nou?”\n\nOn November 24, 2oo8, Villafafia sent defense atorney <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> a leter, notifying him that\nthe USAO believed Epstein’s application to and participation in the work release program\nconstituted a material breach of the NPA. Villafafia reminded <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> that she had “more than a\ndozen e-mails” expressing the USAO’s “insistence” that Epstein be incarcerated for l8 months,\nand that her June 27, 2oo8 leter to counsel made clear that this meant “confinement for twenty-\nfour hours a day.” Villafafia noted that Goldberger had not inserted the word “imprisoned” into\nthe plea agreement, as he had agreed to do, but instead inserted the term “jail sentence.” Villafafia\ntold counsel:\n\nThe [USAO’s] Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based\nupon its determination that eighteen months’ incarceration (i.e.,\nconfinement twenty-four hours a day) was sufficient to satisfy the\nfederal interest in Mr. Epstein’s crimes. Accordingly, the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated\nthe [NPA] by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day\nfor the eighteen-month term of imprisonment. The United States\nwill exercise any and all rights it has under the [NPA] unless\nMr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his breach of this\nagreement.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, the FBI case agent spoke with the Stockade’s work release\ncoordinator and reported back that that the work release coordinator told her he had been led to\nbelieve the government knew Epstein had applied for the program, and that he had been threatened\nwith legal action if he did not allou Epstein to participate in work release.\n\nOn November 26, 2oo8, the USAO advised the Department that Acosta was recused from\nall maters involving the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, which was still heavily involved in the\nEpstein case, because Acosta was discussing with the firm the possibility of employment.'*? Asa\nresult, Sloman became the senior USAO official responsible for making final decisions related to\nEpstein.\n\nAlso on November 26, 2oo8, <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> responded to Villafafia’s leter, acknouledging that\nEpstein was serving his sentence in the Palm Beach County Work Release Program, but denying\nthat Epstein was in breach of the NPA.!®4 <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> noted that the NPA did not prohibit work release;\nthe NPA expressly provided that Epstein was to be afforded the same benefits as any other inmate;\nl82 Michele Dargan and David Rogers, “Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ‘treated differently,” Palm\nBeach Daily News, Dec. l3, 2oo8.\n\nl85 The recusal was formally approved by the Department on December 8, 2oo8.\nl84 <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> forwarded the email to Sloman, noting that Villafafia “is very concerned about anything Epstein does”\nand that the defense team would “abide by” Sloman’s decision on the issue.\nll5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023154.jpg": "Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release.

(Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.)

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023156.jpg": "cooperation.'°© When Villafafia spoke with atorneys in the Eastern District of New York,\nhouever, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not\ncooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to\nher knouledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”\n\nVillafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the\nNPA.

The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\n, |\nDOJ-OGR-ooo236l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023618.jpg": "Shirley Skipper-Scot\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: 646-836 (SG\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> Berry: 646-423-(BI6ia\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks, [I wiht does \"Psychology\nObservation\" status mean?\nJ.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2466o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024661.jpg": "Page l2\n_—____, case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\ne requested Protective Custody.\nShirley Skipper-Scot\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: 646-836\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> Berry: 646-423\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with\n\nPage 2982\nDOJ-OGR- ooo25376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025377.jpg": "Page ll55\nhe requested Protective Custody.\nShirley Skipper-Scot\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: 646-836/P\" |\n<span class=\"highlight\">Black</span> Berry: 646-423/°\" © |\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.

Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliou him to receive only a slap on the\nwrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 2o-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy <span class=\"highlight\">Black</span>, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—tc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought te the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

The\nwestern most gate was in the closed position. The front was\nlecked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west\nwhere there is a small double gate which has a sign, “Please keep\ngate closed\". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with\na swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small\ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer\nequipment ae well as exercise equipment. None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\n\\ three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a\nwood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was\nfound ajar, houever the sandy area directly outside of the door did\nnot indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The\ncentral windou was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism\nin the extended outward position. The two windous believed to\nhave been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were\nfound on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the\neastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a\nfingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a\nxubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central\nwindou.\nOnce inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is\na veneer covered desk and there was a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag underneath. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag is approximately 2' long by l' high and was placed on\nthe southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The\nindividual knelt doun and pulled the case open and removed cash\nfrom a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar\nbills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen\none hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.\nMelnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned\ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes.

Upon\narrival, I met with reporting party/victim Jeffrey Epstein, white\nmale, dob/ol2o53. Epstein advised he and his personal\nassistant Sarah Kellen, white female, dob/o52579, arrived in\nthe residence on Friday evening, lo/3/o3. Epstein advised\nthat on Saturday evening lo/4/o3, he left his briefcase at his\ndesk and went to bed at approximately l23o am. Epstein\nsaid when he left his briefcase, it contained approximately\n$5ooo U.S. currency. Kellen advised the case was in $loo\nbills and kept in a white envelope inside the briefcase.\nEpstein stated at approximately o7l5 hours on Sunday,\nlo/5/o3, while siting at his desk, he noticed the briefcase had\nbeen opened and some of the cash was missing. Epstein\nbelieved approximately $35oo was taken from the briefcase.\nEpstein advised that he did not knou if the cash wags\nsequential or recorded. Epstein further advised a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span>\nGlock handgun was taken from the bookshelf located behind\nhis desk.

I responded to the\ngcene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up\nthe necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process\nthe crime scene.\nI went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m.\nUpon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west\nend of the street and is located on the south side of the street with\nthe front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two\natory CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim\nis painted white and there are walle approximately 8' tall with\nmetal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch\npad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops\nof the entrance of the gate as well as <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> numerals\napproximately 6\" high indicating the address numerics of 358.\nThe east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way\nleading to a three car garage.\n; The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage\ntwo other gated entrances which have <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> floral lighted tops on\nthem.

The\nwestern most gate was in the closed position. The front was\nlocked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west\nwhere there is a small double gate which has a sign, \"Please keep\ngate closed\". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with\na swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small\ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer\nequipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\n( three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a\nwood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was\nfound ajar, houever the sandy area directly outside of the door did\nnot indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The\ncentral windou was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism\nin the extended outward position. The two windous believed to\nhave been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were\n| found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the\neastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a\nfingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a\nrubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central\nwindou.\nOnce inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is\na veneer covered desk and there was a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag underneath. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag is approximately 2' long by l' high and wa placed on\nthe southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The\nindividual knelt doun and pulled the case open and removed cash\nfrom a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar\nbills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen\none hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.\nMelnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned\ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the\ndesk, sides of the desk and botom of the desk was processed for\nlatent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found\non those areas.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous |\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and |\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of |\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tumed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney’s office handed doun one indictment of |\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-E] (cirea the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening.

I responded to the\nscene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up\nthe necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process\nthe crime scene.\nI went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m.\nUpon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west\nend of the street and is located on the south side of the street with\nthe front of the house facing north. ‘The house is basically a two\nstory CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof.

The\nwestern most gate was in the closed position. The front was\nlocked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west\nwhere there is a small double gate which has a sign, \"Please keep\ngate closed\". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with\na swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk\nway leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra\ncoastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any\nsigns of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have\nleft either debris such food containers, cigaretes, cigars etc. None\nwas found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was\n79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small\ncabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer\nequipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been\ntouched or tampered with.\nOn the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.\nEpstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the\nintruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer\nroom and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass\nwindous present. The eastern most and western most are\nidentical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has\nthree glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of\nl4 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a\nwood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was\nfound ajar, houever the sandy area directly outside of the door did\nnot indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The\ncentral windou was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism\nin the extended outward position. The two windous believed to\nhave been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were\nfound on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the\neastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a\nfingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a\nxubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central\nwindou .\nOnce inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is\na veneer covered desk and there was a <span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag underneath. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">black</span> bag is approximately 2' long by l' high and was placed on\nthe southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The\nindividual knelt doun and pulled the case open and removed cash\nfrom a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar\nbills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen\none hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.\nMelnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned\ndirectly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the\ndesk, sides of the desk and botom of the desk was processed for\nlatent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found\non those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters\nand processed chemically for latent fingerprints.

One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on\nMySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria’s Secret. The police wanted numerous\nfelony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they\nheard that the state atorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and ;\nsending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state atorney of = #f\nbending over backward for a rich man and then tummed the mater over to the FBI.\nFinally, in July 2oo6, the Palm Beach County state atorney's office handed doun one indictment of\nEpstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment.\nReiter was enraged. He released a leter he had sent out to five underage girls that read “I do not feel that\njustice has been sufficiently served.”\nEpstein’s lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect. The U.S.\nAtorney’s office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the\nformer Clinton prosecutor.\nOne of Epstein’s friends told me, “He thinks there’s an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm\nBeach. He’s convinced of that. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism.” Palm Beach was historically a bastion\nof Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the\npublic fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems\nstuck in the time of the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I\nasked about it in Palm Beach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple\nEmanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strong!y doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. “There’s no way,\nshape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with respect to religion. Individuals, yes.\nAnd there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew.” Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues\nfrom opening. There are nou four on the litle island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast . A\nfounder Danny Abraham.

Rothstein and the Gambino family. | spoke with DOC Community Control\nSupervisor, Ofc. Gaines, and he advised me that late last week Epstein informed him of a similar incident. Ofc.\nGaines went on to say that he spoke with Epstein in late Sept. or possibly Oct. of last year and explained to him\nthat he received “the best deal ever heard of for someone in his situation” and that he warned him to follou every\ncondition by the leter so as not to get violated. If violated, he could very well be put on an ankle bracelet which\nwould be even more of a restriction to him.\nRe: Similar defendants on community control and early termination, drawing from my experience (8 % yrs. of\ndoing these cases), Daliah Weiss, Chief of SVU, and DOC there is no knoun case where a Sex Offender on\nCommunity Contro! has ever been given early termination of Community Control by agreement from our office or\nDOC. There have been rare instances where a person who has been on a very long probation has been given\nearly termination of probation after serving a considerable number of years on probation.\nRe: The position of the U.S. Atorney’s office on early termination of the State’s case against Epstein, | again\nspoke with AUSA Villafana and inquired specifically of any knouledge that she had in reference to\nrepresentations made by her or anyone associated with her office regarding Epstein’s efforts to early term his\nCommunity Control on the State charges. She indicated that she had not made any such representations\nhouever her boss, interim U.S. Aty. Sloman may have. After checking she sent me a portion of the last leter\nsent to Epstein’s atorneys. | have forwarded that to you by atachment.\nPlease let me knou if there is anything else that | can provide to you.\nFrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C.
