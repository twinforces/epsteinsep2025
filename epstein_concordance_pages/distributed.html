Due to\nthe large number of potential jurors (6oo), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the\njurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to\nuncover issues that may require follou-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or\nenable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner.\n\nRecently, in Sines, et al. v.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and <span class=\"highlight\">distributed</span>\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and <span class=\"highlight\">distributed</span> by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential resolution of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it. The Program and Protocol were approved by a court\norder from the Probate Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands and I abided by the terms and guiding\nprinciples of the Protocol in every way and at every step of the process. Failing to abide by any\nterm of the Protocol, much less the keystone condition of confidentiality, is intolerable,\nimpermissible, and would lead to the unraveling of the Program. Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page6of7\n\nl4. | Asamater of public policy, ensuring confidentiality in litigation-alternative\nvictim compensation programs like the EVCP is an absolute imperative. To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or <span class=\"highlight\">distributed</span> by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and <span class=\"highlight\">distributed</span>\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and <span class=\"highlight\">distributed</span> to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll.
