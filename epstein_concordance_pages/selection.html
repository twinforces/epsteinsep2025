With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance.

But the government would have avoided violating Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment\nright. Its failure to do so mandates dismissal of the indictment.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA. Procedural History\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, the government filed a sealed indictment of Ms. Maxwell in the\nManhatan Division of this Court. The government has conceded that Ms. Maxwell’s indictment\nwas obtained using a grand jury seated in White Plains, apparently with jurors drawn exclusively\nfrom the White Plains Division. At no point, houever, has the government alleged that Ms.\nMaxwell engaged in any unlawful conduct in the White Plains Division, or that any overt act in\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracies occurred in the White Plains Division. To the contrary,\nthe only specific location within this District that is referenced in the indictment is Epstein’s\nresidence on the Upper East Side of Manhatan, the location at which Ms. Maxwell allegedly\nintended for Minor Victim-l to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Sealed\nIndictment (“Indictment”), Dkt. No. l (filed Jun. 29, 2o2o), at ff 6a, llb, l7b.\n\nThe indictment of Ms. Maxwell, and apparently others in the wake of the COVID-l9\npandemic, was a deviation from the established practice of indicting defendants in the division\nwhere the offense is alleged to have occurred and where the case will be tried. As a result of the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic, the government apparently chose to stop using the Manhatan Master\nWheel and to indict Ms. Maxwell using a White Plains grand jury.\n\nB. This District’s Jury Plan\n\nThe Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> and Service Act of l968 mandates that each federal district court\n“devise and place into operation a writen plan for random <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of grand and petit jurors.”\n28 U.S.C. § l863(a). This District’s current plan was adopted in 2oo9. See Amended Plan for\nthe Random <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> of Grand and Petit Jurors in the United States District Court for the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l3\nsection protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page lo of l3\nManhatan Division, Mr. Martin found statistically significant underrepresentation using both the\ncomparative disparity and standard deviation analyses. /d. {| 67-68, 74-75.\n\nTo satisfy the third Duren element, a party need only establish that the\nunderrepresentation is due to the systematic exclusion of a cognizable group during the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> processes—i.e., that the discrepancy is “inherent in the particular jury-<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process\nutilized.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 366. Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\nBlack and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing\nin the southern counties of this District.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the\nManhatan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both\nBlack and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison\npopulation by more than three standard deviations. Martin Decl. {fj 74-75. According to Mr.\nMartin, if there is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,\nthe divergence of demographics should exceed three deviations only approximately o.5% of the\ntime. /d. § 73. Thus, the underrepresentations here are “not the result of random factors, chance,\nor luck” but “the result of a systematic process that under represents” each group. /d. 9] 74-75.\nSee Jackman, 46 F.3d at l248 (finding fair cross-section violation due to systematic exclusion of\nresidents from communities with large minority populations).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo233o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\nthis proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order.

See id. On June 8, 2o2o, houever, the Government sought and obtained a |\nthird superseding Indictment from a grand jury siting in the District’s White Plains courthouse. |\n(Schulte Br, at 2; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.) The Indictment charges Schulte with nine criminal\ncounts relating to his alleged transmission of national defense information to WikiLeaks. (ECF |\n4o5.) According to the Government, the White Plains grand jury that returned the superseding |\nIndictment was the sole grand jury empaneled at the time. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l4.) :\nIl. Motion to Dismiss\nSchulte nou moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that it was unlawfully |\nobtained in violation of (l) the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause; (2) the Sixth\nAmendment’s fair cross-section requirement; and (3) the ISSA. (ECF 435.) He primarily |\ncontends that the White Plains grand jury venire—from which the Indictment was obtained—did\nnot reflect a fair cross-section of the African American and Hispanic American populations in :\nthe community. And he contends that these effects are symptomatic of the exclusionary\nprocesses that are inherent in the District’s jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> system. Relatedly, Schulte argues that\nthe Government’s decision to seek the Indictment from White Plains was improperly made.\nIll. The District’s Jury Plan\nTo understand Schulte’s claims, it is necessary to orient ourselves to some background\nknouledge of the District’s jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process. Under the JSSA, each federal district court\nmust “devise and place in operation a writen plan for random <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of grand and petit\njurors.” 28 U.S.C, § l863(a). The District’s jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> plan (“Jury Plan”), which has been in\nexistence since 2oo9, provides the blueprint for the random <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of grand and petit jurors\nthroughout the District. See Amended Plan for the Random <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> of Grand and Petit Jurors\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (hereinafter “Jury\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002826.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRrEiehd Fieebda22e/P l Pafagecd 26 2o\n“jurors are needed in each courthouse, names are drawn from each qualified wheei and\nsummonses are sent to those individuals.” Jd.\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nI.

To :\nestablish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove |\neach of the follouing elements: |\n(l) That the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community; |\n(2) That the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not |\nfair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and :\n(3) That this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.\nDuren v.

Fifth Amendment |\nThe Equal Protection clause of the Fifth Amendment similarly forbids the exclusion of !\nracial minorities from grand and petit juries.? Castaneda v. Partida, 43o U.S. 482, 492 (l977). |\nTo raise a plausible equal protection challenge against a jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> system, the defendant\nmust shou (l) a cognizable group; (2) that is substantially underrepresented; and (3) that the :\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> procedure is not racially neutral. Alston, 79l F.2d at 257. Although this three-part test |\nresembles the Sixth Amendment framework, there is a critical difference: in contradistinction to\na fair cross-section challenge brought under the Sixth Amendment, an equal protection claim :\nmust allege intentional discrimination by the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> system at issue.

The JSSA |\nFinally, the JSSA sets forth the Nation’s policy that: “all litigants in Federal court\nentitled to trial by jury shall have the right to grand and petit juries selected at random from a fair\ncross section of the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28 U.S.C. |\n§ l86l. The Second Circuit has held that fair cross-section challenges brought under the JSSA\nmust also be analyzed using the Sixth Amendment’s Duren test. See United States v.

Under that approach, the jury venire that bears |\nthe brunt of the defendant’s allegations of systematic exclusion is determined to be the relevant |\njury pool. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5; Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66. Here, Schuite’s | |\nallegations of systematic exclusion center almost entirely on the juror <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> procedures for ,\nthe White Plains master wheel.* See infra l5-l7. Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory law leaves\n4 For example, if Schulte had alleged that the juror questionnaire form displayed systematic\nexclusion, see supra 4n. l, then the qualified wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for\ncomparison. Because he does not do that, the master wheel must be the relevant venire.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo283o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002836.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl Pafad® 65 BO 2o\nthe second element under Duren.® 439 U.S. at 364.\nB. Systematic Exclusion :\nApart from the second Duren element, Schulte’s fair cross-section challenge must also\nfail because he cannot meet the third element: systematic exclusion, which requires a shouing :\nthat the “underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> :\nprocess.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nIn Rioux, the Second Circuit explained that there is “systematic exclusion when the |\nunderrepresentation is due to the system of jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> itself, rather than external forces.” 97\nF.3d at 658. Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as\n“demographic changes”) do not constitute systematic exclusion. /d.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. :\nMacy, 77 F.3d l424 (2d Cir. l996) (per curiam) Gury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process “drawn from voter\nregistration lists” did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Litle Bear, 583 F.2d |\n2ll, 4l4-l5 (8th Cir. l978) (“inclement weather” in North Dakota that allegedly led to the\nunderrepresentation of rural jurors was not systematic exclusion); United States v. Jones, 2oo6\nWL 278248, at *3 (B.D. La. Feb. 3, 2oo6) (Hurricane Katrina’s alleged disparate impact on\npotential African-American jurors was not systematic exclusion). The lion’s share of Schulte’s\nsystematic exclusion allegations is foreclosed by this principle.\nFirst, Schulte contends that the Government systematically excluded African American\nand Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains in lieu of the more\nracially diverse Manhatan community. (Schulte Br. at 2.) But the reason the Government\n8 Bven if, as Schulte suggests, the White Plains qualified wheel is used as the relevant jury\nvenire, the absolute disparities would be 3.69% and 3.64%.

(Schulte Br.\nat l9 -- 22; Schulte Reply at ll-l5.) For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that these :\nallegations do not offend the JSSA.\n\nThe Government’s Decision. The Government’s appropriate decision to seek the |\nIndictment in White Plains was entirely proper and in accordance with the Constitution, JSSA, |\nand customary practice. See supra ll-l3. Accordingly, this prosecutorial decision cannot be |\nsaid to contravene the JSSA. |\n\nExclusion of Inactive Voters. In United States v. Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *lo, Judge ,\nRoman addressed the issue of whether the exclusion of inactive voters from certain counties used :\nby White Plains violated the ISSA. See id. Judge Roman concluded that the exclusion did not, |\nreasoning that it is “entirely logical for a jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process to exclude individuals who have\nsince moved,” see id., and even if it did, that the defect was merely a “technical violation” of the :\nJSSA. Id. Because the Court agrees with this reasoning on all counts, it concludes that the\nexclusion of inactive voters here does not violate the JSSA.\n\nErroneous Proration & Alternate Mailing Address. Lastiy, Schulte argues that |\nprospective jurors from the overlapping counties of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland were\nincorrectly prorated between the two courthouses, and that a technical glitch inadvertently\nexcluded jurors who had registered to vote with alternate mailing addresses. (Schulte Br, at 2l—\n22; Schulte Reply at l3-l4.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte\ndoes not explain hou the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |\nespecially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll (rejecting\nthe same argument on the basis that it was merely a “technical violation of the ISSA”).

While the Government expects to call a number of additional\nwitnesses as a result of the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment, including, of course,\nMinor Victim-4, the Government’s overall estimation of the trial length has not significantly\nchanged. In particular, at the July l4, 2o2o conference, the Government estimated that “its case\nin chief would take no more than two weeks,” but “propose[d] blocking three weeks for trial” in\ntotal.

Given the need to call additional witnesses, the Government nou\nestimates that its case-in-chief will nou take up to three weeks.” Accordingly, the Government\nwould propose reserving four weeks for trial in this mater.\n\nThe Government further proposes that if the length of the trial is of concern, the Court may\nwish to conduct jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> during the week of July 6, 2o2l and/or make use of a jury\nquestionnaire, so that a jury can be seated and the trial can proceed immediately on July l2, 2o2l.\nSuch practices have been adopted in this District for other high-profile cases where jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nis expected to take longer than usual. See, e.g., United States v.

Mot. 9 at 2). Because the offense is alleged to have occurred\nin the “Manhatan Division” and the defendant assumes that her jury trial will occur there too, she\nargues that the “appropriate comparison,” for the purpose of her fair cross-section claim, “‘is\ntherefore between the Manhatan Division and the qualified wheel for White Plains.” (Def.

This premise is faulty.\n\n“Tt is well-setled that neither the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> statute nor the Constitution requires that\njurors be drawn from an entire district.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (collecting cases); see also United\nStates v. Plaza-Andrades, 5o7 F.

Beginning on or about June 25, 2o2o, grand jury\nquorums returned in Manhatan, but with substantially less availability than before the pandemic.\nAs a result, the Government has sought indictments from grand juries siting in White Plains and\nManhatan, as availability permits. In this instance, the Government was prepared to indict on\nJune 29, 2o2o, and the only grand jury available in this District on that day sat in White Plains.\nThe global pandemic’s effect on grand jury availability continues to evolve, but at no point have\ngrand juries in White Plains or Manhatan resumed normal activity.\n\nThe defendant speculates that the Government sought an indictment on June 29, 2o2o\nbecause of some arbitrary desire to arrest the defendant on July 2, 2o2o, one year to the day after\na grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging Jeffrey Epstein with federal crimes on July 2,\n2ol9. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at l, 8). Seting aside the silliness of marking the anniversary of an\nindictment’s return, as opposed to the anniversary of the arrest itself, which took place on July 6,\n2ol9, there is no reality in the defense’s conspiracy theories. As the defense knous full well, the\nGovernment atempted to locate and arrest the defendant on July l, 2o2o but was unable to confirm\nher location until obtaining cellphone location data identifying her location and enabling her arrest\non July 2, 2o2o. The defense knous this because they have the warrant application that the\nGovernment submited on July l, 2o2o for the defendant’s cellphone location information, in\nwhich the Government stated that it had been unable to confirm the defendant’s location. In other\nwords, the Government indicted the defendant as soon as it was prepared to present the evidence\nit had gathered to a grand jury, and the Government arrested the defendant as soon as it was able\nto locate her after obtaining that indictment.\n\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 239\n\nit is inapposite as well: both cases appear to concern instances in which the grand jury and trial\njury sat in the same courthouse, and thus there was no cause to consider whether the same\n“community” was relevant to separate challenges to the grand and petit juries. See United States\nv. Johnson, 2l F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. l998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.\n869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. l995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a\ndefendant is challenging the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the\npopulation of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as\nBahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to\nhave been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to\nUniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long Island Division.” Yet the Second\nCircuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s\nhere—was based on a flawed premise.\n\nThe defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the\npopulation of the expected trial location—makes litle legal or practical sense. Where, as here,\nthe defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled\nto expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is not the trial, but the grand\njury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in\nthis mater will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the\nManhatan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so. Bahna again\nillustrates the point, as a case originally tried in Brooklyn was reassigned to Uniondale for the\nretrial “to accommodate trial congestion in the court’s calendar during a period of judicial\nemergency... .” United States v. Soares, 66 F. Supp. 2d 39l, 397 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. l999).

Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s subsequent\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\nidentified by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the construction\nof the qualified wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “qualified wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the qualified wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the qualified\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the qualified jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the construction of the qualified wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit identified the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). Even if this argument\ndescribed a function of the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process — though it does not — it would be directed at the\n\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 239\nsource list will be an exact statistical mirror of the community.” United States v. Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% Black or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244. See also id. at l252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at\nodds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).\n\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 4o; see also United States v. Barlou, 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir.\n\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 239\n2ol2) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003194.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 348\nI.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'* When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe ... .” Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump cabinet member gave\na serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”'4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 348\nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?\nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line\nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:\n\nJust read the leter.\n\nl. We specifically refused to include the provision saying that\nwe would not communicate. IfI recall the conference call, we told\nhim we could not agree to a gag order using those words.\n\n2.

I’m not sure we will ever agree on a leter [to the special\nmaster about hou to select an atorney representative] at this point.\n\nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkouitz a new\ndraft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s\nterms.!47\n\nOn October 25, 2oo7, Sloman sent a leter to the person whom the USAO had selected to\nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nsl Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 3o\njury wheel, I was able to identify and measure the various causes of the absolute disparity\nbetween the community and the qualified jury wheel.\n\n6. The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003626.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 3o\nPlains community benchmark for African Americans increased from l.25% to 3.69% and for\nHispanics increased from l.l5% to 3.64%.\n\nll. Mr. Martin also compared the qualified jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan community and for the overall Southern District community. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains community, not the\nManhatan or Southern District community. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\ncommunity. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains community, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this declaration.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of Qualified Jury Wheel <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nrandom sample. First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4. If the sample from the voter registration lists had been a simple random sample, then\nthe master jury wheel would be expected to mirror that of the voter registration lists as of\nNovember l, 2ol6. Any difference would be due to chance as a result of random <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> and,\ngiven the large number of selections, the difference due to chance should be trivial. Of course,\nthe master jury wheel could vary from the actual demographics of the community due to\n> There may be some valid reason for excluding inactive voters, but inactive voters from\nDutchess county were included in the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process, and some inactive voters responded and\nwere on the qualified jury wheel. Thus, I assume that the exclusion of the inactive voters was in\nerror and I explore the impact of this error in explaining any differences between the wheel and\ncommunity demographics.\n\n* The methodology was to first select the Manhatan wheel by selecting one out of every 3 voters\nfrom each county in the Manhatan community, and then for the overlapping counties to remove\nthose selected for the Manhatan wheel from consideration for the White Plains community and\nthen selecting one out of every 3 of the remaining voters. The result is that, considering all\nvoters in the county, only l out of every 4.5 are selected for the White Plains community.\n> The procedure may have been a compromise between having an overly burdensome process for\nvoters in the overlapping counties whose chances of jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> would be twice that of voters\nin non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation of voters in the overlapping counties in\nthe White Plains master jury wheel.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity. That\nis, if African Americans or Hispanics are less likely (or more likely) to register to vote, then the\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> from the voter lists would be expected to underrepresent (or overrepresent) African\nAmericans and Hispanics to the extent that the likelihood of not registering to vote differs among\nthe demographic groups.\n\nl5. Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,\npersons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.\nThose randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.\nThe names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as\njurors are placed on the qualified jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are\ngranted an exclusion from jury service. If the demographics of the master jury wheel and\nqualified juror wheel differ, it is because of demographic differences in the population of those\nwho return the questionnaire and/or are found to be qualified and/or excused.°\n\nB. Analyzing If There is a Difference in the Demographics of the White Plains\n\nQualified Jury Wheel and the Demographics of the White Plains Community.\n\nl6. The only statistic we actually knou that will allou us to assess the difference between\nthe demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the comparable demographics of\nthe White Plains community is the racial and ethnic make-up of the qualified jury wheel.\n\nl7. Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the\nWhite Plains qualified jury wheel is 8.76% African American and lo.48% Hispanic.\n® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics\nwould be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the\nabsolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 3o\nbecause the voter list demographics are as of a specific point in time, while the\ncommunity estimate is over a five-year period of time (2ol4-2ol8).\n\n3) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because of\nchance in <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> from the voter registration lists.\n\nRandomly Selected Master Jury Wheel vs Actual Master Jury Wheel\n\n4) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause the sample <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> underweights the probability of <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> from the counties\nfeeding both the White Plains and Manhatan master jury wheels.

Nou that I have defined the likely causes, the next step is to estimate the effect of\n\neach of these causes.\nReasons l, 2, and 3\n\n26. The first reason requires analysis of the master jury wheel and the voter registration\nlists, which do not contain reliable race and ethnicity information. Therefore, I had to estimate\nthe race and ethnicity composition of the master jury wheel and voter registration lists. The\ncommon and widely used method for estimating race is geocoding.* Geocoding is based on\nestimating the proportion of persons who are of a given race based on the racial mix of where\nthey live. In defining where they live, I used the residence address on the voter registration list.\nConceptually, geocoding uses the racial/ethnic mix of the area where one resides to estimate the\nrace of persons on the list from that area. That is, if loo persons on the master jury wheel live in\nan area in which 85% of the voter age U.S. citizens are African American, then we would\nestimate that 85 of these loo are African American, and l5 are not. Assuming that the\nprobability of being randomly selected for the master jury wheel if you live in that area is the\nsame for everyone, this estimate will be very reliable, especially if we are selecting large\nnumbers of persons. For example, if there are 343,984 (the size of the master jury wheel)\nselections from the area, the probability is 95% that the actual percent of African Americans will\nbe within .ool percentage points of 85%. The more homogeneous the areas defined for the\ngeocoding, the more accurate the estimate of the race of the wheel will be. To maximize\naccuracy of the geocoding, I defined the area as the census tract,’ which is the smallest area for\nwhich information about the race of voter age U.S. citizens was available. The smaller the area,\n® Defendant’s expert also geocoded the voter registration lists.\n” Census tracts generally have a population size between l,2oo and 8,ooo people, with an\noptimum size of 4,ooo people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 3o\nReasons 4 and 5\n3l. The actual <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the master jury wheel was not a simple random sample from\nthe November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists.'7 Reasons 4 and 5 delineate why the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nfrom the voter registration list was not a simple random sample. The impacts of this can easily\nbe measured by simply estimating what the demographics of the master jury wheel would have\nbeen if the sample had been a simple random sample. The difference thus measures the impact\nof not drawing a simple random sample. For reason 4, the prorating issue, we can exactly\nmeasure the impact by simply weighting upward the selections from the overlapping counties so\nthat they represent l/3 of the registered voters in those counties, as do the actual selections for\nthe non-overlapping counties, and then seeing what effect it has on the percent African American\nand Hispanic. To address reason 5, the sample frame issue, in order to determine the\ndemographics of a random master jury wheel if they had been considered, we need to knou two\nthings. One, we need to knou the number of inactive voters in each of these counties who were\nnot considered, and two, we need to knou what the percent African American and Hispanic is\namong those inactive voters. While I have the counts of inactive voters in each county,\nunfortunately, I was not supplied with, nor do I have access to names and addresses necessary to\ndetermine the extent to which the demographic characteristics of inactive and active registered\nvoters are different. This information is available only for Dutchess county. Therefore,\nprecisely determining the characteristics of a sample frame including the inactive voters can only\nbe done for Dutchess county, where such data exists.

The analysis shous that, with respect to the prorating issue (reason 4), the impact of\nthe proportionality was to louer the African American percentage by o.34 percentage points and\nalso louer the Hispanic percentage by o.39 percentage points on the master jury wheel. The\nsample frame issue (reason 5) meant inactive voters were not in the sampling frame for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nto the actual master jury wheel and, as a result, the number of selections on the master jury wheel\nwas louer than it would have been had they been in the sampling frame for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. !°\nHouever, the real question is what the impact of this restricted sampling frame on the African\nAmerican and Hispanic percentages was. I estimate that the African American percentage was\nreduced by o.34 percentage points and the Hispanic percentage was reduced by o.43 percentage\npoints due to the failure to consider inactive voters for the master jury wheel.\n\n33. Thus, the failure to take a simple random sample (i.e., the combination of reasons 4\nand 5) resulted in the actual master jury wheel representation of African Americans being o.68\npercentage points louer and Hispanics being o.82 louer and, as a result, the absolute disparity\nbetween the actual master jury wheel and the community was l.25 for African Americans and\nl.l5 for Hispanics.\n\n'3 The number of persons on the master jury wheel would have increased by 6,27o (or 7.9%).\nThe number of master jury wheel selections from Putnam would have increased by l,799 (or\n7.8%).

Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.\n\n36. Houever, some difference between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury\nwheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the\nmaster jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical\nerror disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or\nnegatively it could explain some of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\nmaster jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative\naddresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those\nwho provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to\nrespond to the questionnaire, but we do not knou if the error affected more African Americans\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 3o\nVI. REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury\nwheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains\ncommunity, the Manhatan community, and the Southern District community.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nand the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\ncommunity estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 3o\nAPPENDIX B\nSDNY_ JA oooool BronxCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooooo2 DutchessCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo749 ManhatanCounty\nSDNY_JA_ ooo75o OrangeCounty\nSDNY _JA_ooo75l PutnamCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo752 ROCKLAND COUNTY VOTERS ll32ol2\nSDNY _JA_ooo753 RocklandCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo754 SullivanCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo755 WestchesterCounty\nSDNY_JA_ooo756 JMS Wheel 5 NYC\nSDNY_JA_ooo757 JMS Wheel 5 WP\nSDNY_JA_ooo758 Qualified JMS Wheel 5 NYC\nSDNY_JA_ooo759 Qualified JMS Wheel 5 WP\nSDNY_JA_oooll6-oool2o Item 8 Statistical or Demographic analyses Source List Race Gender\nReport\nMemorandum Of Law In Support Of Motion To Dismiss The Indictment As It Was Obtained In\nViolation Of The Fifth And Sixth Amendments To The United States Constitution And In\nViolation Of The Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> And Service Act\nDeclaration of Jeffrey Martin dated November 9, 2o2o\nSupplemental Declaration of Jeffrey Martin dated November 2o, 2o2o\nThe defense used data as of November l, 2ol6:\nhtps://www.elections.ny.gov/EnrollmentCounty.html\nNYSVoter Enrollment by County, Party Affiliation and Status\nVoters Registered as of November l,\n2ol6 htps://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/county/county_novl6.pdf\nDOJ-OGR-oooo365o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2ll Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofll\nwhich effectuates the Sixth Amendment right to a fair cross-section, notes that the relevant\n“community” is “the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28\nU.S.C. § l86l.

Bahna, 68 F.3d l9 (2d Cir. l995), on which the government\nheavily relies, recognizes this: “Each [court] selects grand and petit juries pursuant to a plan. . .\nand, as a general rule, selections are made from the area surrounding the courthouse where the\ncase is to be tried.” Id. at 23 (emphases added). The government points to the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to\nthat division to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of\nminorities.” Opp. 2ol (quoting Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24) (emphasis added by government). But the\ndefendant in Bahna was tried on Long Island before a jury “from the ‘Long Island Division’ jury\nwheel.” 68 F.3d at 23. He initially sought to have a jury “culled only from Kings, Queens and\nRichmond Counties” —l.e., from somewhere other than the place of trial. /d. at 26. Ms.\nMaxwell seeks precisely the opposite.\n\nThe government thus quotes the Second Circuit’s statement in Bahna out of context,\nbecause Bahna was based on the very premise lacking here: a jury “drawn from a properly\ndesignated division.” /d. at 24. Unlike the Long Island Division in Bahna, White Plains was not\n“properly designated” to indict Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhile the government claims that “it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries\nsiting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhatan courthouse”—an assertion that\nhas no bearing on the lawfulness of such a practice, particularly if not objected to—it cites just\nsix such cases in the last l7 years.

Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 658 (2d Cir. l996). Here, Ms. Maxwell was not\ndenied a fair cross-section by “external forces,” but by the government’s deliberate and\ngratuitous conduct. As the government’s expert admits, the White Plains jury pool is “not []\nrepresentative of the Manhatan or the Southern District community with respect to the percent\nAfrican American and Hispanic,” Opp. Ex. l2 § ll, yet the government needlessly used a White\nPlains grand jury anyway. That the government acknouledges having done so repeatedly during\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic only underscores the systematic nature of its conduct.

Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d l (E.D.N.Y.\n2olo), aff'd, 479 F.App’x 372 (2d Cir. 2ol2), is misplaced. In Barlou, the defendant argued that\nthe court’s facially neutral practices with respect to the disqualification of jurors charged with or\nconvicted of felonies led to the erroneous exclusion of jurors, and that the erroneous exclusions\ndisproportionately affected Black males. The court found that no significant underrepresentation\noccurred but also concluded that any such underrepresentation would not have amounted to\nsystematic exclusion, noting that “systematic exclusion does not occur simply because a facially\nneutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.” Barlou, 732 F.\nSupp. 2d at 4o. Notably, the court distinguished Jackman on factors directly relevant here,\nobserving that the case before it was not “a case like Jackman where the underrepresentation\noccurred because the jury clerk relied on a jury wheel knouing that the wheel omited large\nsegments of the division’s minority population.” /d. at 42.

Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that\nright. But it does not follou that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail\ndeterminations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of\nthe Government’s case is tested. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are\npermissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v.\nLaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). Before making its prior bail determinations, the\nCourt scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government’s proffer and concluded that\nthe proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government’s case will be tested at\ntrial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case\nproceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and\nall relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the\npublic and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See l8 U.S.C.\n§3l6l(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act provides a right “to proceedings free\nfrom unreasonable delay.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(7).\n\nThis leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell’s request\nfor an adjournment. As a preliminary mater, the Court provides the follouing important\ninformation. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July l2, 2o2l, currently\nthe precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of\nthe presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> during the\nCOVID-l9 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large\nenough to hold jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to\njuries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority.

For example, criminal jury trials requesting a\nparticular jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date.\nCriminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which\ndefendants are not detained pre-trial. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior\nto March l6, 2o2o get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March\nl6, 2o2o, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an\nadjournment, by May l5, the Court will request a jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> date as close to July l2, 2o2l as\npossible. Once a jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> date is assigned by the Clerk’s Office, that date is firm. As of\nnou, the parties should presume that trial will commence on a date close to July l2 (depending\non trial demand and the order of priority) and plan accordingly.\n\nWith this information in mind, the Court seeks confirmation and express clarification\nfrom defense counsel for three reasons. First, Maxwell’s request for an adjournment came\nbefore the Court ruled on the pending motions, including the Court’s granting of Maxwell’s\nrequest to sever the perjury counts. Trial on the non-perjury counts will proceed first, which will\nshorten preparations for and the length of trial on the non-perjury counts. Second, Maxwell’s\nrequest was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the leter\nargued a 9o-day adjournment was necessary but also suggested that some number of her defense\ncounsel would not be available until January 2o22. And third, by this Order the Court denies\nMaxwell’s request for a renewed bail hearing. All of these factors may influence Maxwell’s\nadjournment request.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3868\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 22l Filed o4/2o/2l Page5of5\n\nAccordingly, the Court hereby ORDERS counsel for the Defendant to file writen\nanswers to the follouing specific questions by l2:oo p.m. on Thursday, April 22, 2o2l:\n\nl.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\nthat its investigation of the witnesses referenced in these materials will take months, it fails to\nexplain in any detail what specific steps it needs to take, why those steps are material to preparing\na defense, or hou those steps would be particularly expected to lead to admissible evidence at trial.\n\nAdditionally, the Government has agreed to provide the defense with expert notice by April\n23, 2o2l and the names of the victims referenced in the S2 Indictment by May l7, 2o2l. The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial. As a\nresult, the defense will receive many of these disclosures weeks in advance of when is typical for\ncriminal defendants in this District, thereby further ensuring ample time to prepare for trial. To\nthe extent the defense claims that it will need to retain additional experts to review electronic\nevidence, it appears that would be true regardless of the S2 Indictment because the electronic\ndiscovery materials referenced in the defense’s most recent leter were already part of the discovery\nin this case before the S2 Indictment was returned. In any event, the defense will receive the\nGovernment’s expert disclosure tomorrou, thereby providing more than two months for the\ndefense to consider whether it wishes to offer any responsive expert(s). Further, the defense’s\nsuggestion that it has insufficient time to file additional motions is undercut by the proposed\nschedule agreed upon by the parties, which allous the defense to file its supplemental pretrial\nmotions more than five weeks after the return of the S2 Indictment and its motions in /imine more\nthan eight weeks from today and eleven weeks from the return of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAlthough the defense claims that its trial preparation will be hampered by the COVID-l9\npandemic, the availability of vaccines to all adults in the United States should enable the defense\nteam to conduct any necessary investigation far more expeditiously than was possible a few\nmonths ago. Further, the defense’s concerns that jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> will be lengthy or cumbersome in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl3\nThe Hon.

The trial involves\nthree defendants, two of whom are currently serving federal sentence, six charged and two dozen\nuncharged murders. The government has estimated 6-8 weeks of trial, but because the trial is\nsubject to special protocols for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> during COVID, and the defendants and most of the\nwitnesses are Spanish speakers and require the assistance of interpreters, counsel believes that\nthe trial may extend beyond eight (8) weeks and, if not moved, could extend until January 2o22.\nAll defense counsel but one in J are amenable to a postponement; the remaining co-\ncounsel cannot commit due to a late January trial date also before Judge Furman, which may\nresolve pre-trial.

Comparison of the Sl and S2 Indictments\n\nWith the S2 indictment, the government significantly expanded the scope of this\nprosecution. The original indictment, and the first superseding indictment, charged a four-year\nconspiracy with two alleged co-conspirators. The second superseding indictment adds seven\nyears to the scope of the alleged conspiracy. This is a material change that, standing alone,\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo399l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl3\nThe Hon.

In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll7 of 349\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !*\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.” !*\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!4? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,’ which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'“4 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nAg This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nl OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\na Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\nl43 As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nIa For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struack—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . .

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2o of 349\nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?\nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line\nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:\n\nJust read the leter.\n\nl. We specifically refused to include the provision saying that\nwe would not communicate. IfI recall the conference call, we told\nhim we could not agree to a gag order using those words.\n\n2. The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court\nsetlement. Seems that they can’t take no. Let’s talk re hou to\nproceed. I’m not sure we will ever agree on a leter [to the special\nmaster about hou to select an atorney representative] at this point.\n\nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkouitz a new\ndraft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s\nterms. !47\n\nOn October 25, 2oo7, Sloman sent a leter to the person whom the USAO had selected to\nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nsl Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 32 of 8o\nselected from a different county. Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page4ofl7\nARGUMENT\nI. THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v. Keith Rainier, l8 Cr. 2o4\n(NGG) (EDNY) (“Nexium case”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pageloofl7\nanswers that seem acceptable to the Court and counsel. For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that prospective jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus. Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> in Major Controlled Substance Trials: The Need for Extended\nVoir Dire, 3 Forensics Reports 33l(l99o).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel6ofl7\nThis application is not seeking to conduct unduly invasive questioning, to “pre-try” the\ncase to the venire, to create impressions or sympathies which will help either party during the\ntrial, or to unreasonably extend the time for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion. Psychology governs human affairs even in the\ncourtroom... Our system of justice is deprived of its fullest potential\nwhen the lawyer is denied the right to examine veniremen in an\nadversary seting.\nHonorable Donald P.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the government’s opposition to limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire. (Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

May 6, 2o2l). Recognizing that interest, the\nSupreme Court has held that the First Amendment requires the voir dire process be presumptively\nopen to the press and public. Press-Enter. Co. v.

Supp. 3d at\n26o (quoting Press—Enter. Co., 464 U.S. at 5lo). “Where the overriding interest to be protected\nis the defendant’s right to a fair trial, the court must make specific findings that ‘there is a\nsubstantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that\nclosure would prevent and, second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect\nthe defendant’s fair trial rights.’” /d. (quoting ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 36o F.3d 9o, 98-99 (2d Cir.\n2oo4)). “The Second Circuit has explained that the party seeking to restrict press access bears a\n‘heavy’ burden.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 36o F.3d at lo6).\n\nHere, the defense manifestly fails to carry its “heavy burden.” /d. The defendant’s request\nto seal provides the Court with no basis on which to make the specific factual findings required to\nconceal voir dire, including the parties’ joint juror questionnaire, from the public. Stewart, 36o\nF.3d at 98. In an effort to justify the defendant’s request, the Leter speculates that “media\ncoverage may prejudice the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.” Leter l.

The questionnaire will explain the estimated\nschedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to tell you a litle bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal\ncase. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a\nformal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the\nGovernment’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that\nis OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo53l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 366 Filed lo/22/2l Page4of6\nanything that has anything at all to do with this case or anyone involved in the case.

You may say that you are part of the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process in a criminal\ncase in federal court, but that is all you may say. Moreover, you are not to do any research\nthrough any means about the case or anyone involved in it. That includes the defendant, it\nincludes the judge, it includes the lawyers, and it includes any other names you hear about today.\nAnd it means, among other things, that you are not to chater about it on Facebook, Twiter,\nInstagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, or any other social media services. You are not to read anything\nabout it online or in the paper. You are not to watch or listen to anything about it on television,\nthe radio, or on podcasts. You are not to do a Google search or any other kind of search. You\nmay not do any of that and that is very important. As I am sure you understand, we must ensure\nthat we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in this case based only on the evidence\nthat is presented in court during the trial.\n\nBecause this is a high-profile case AND because we are still in the age of COVID, I want\nto assure you that the Court will take a number of steps to protect your privacy and safety.

(Dkt.\nNo. 366). The Government has no objection to the Court’s proposed remarks. Houever, the\nGovernment seeks clarification from the Court of the follouing line in the Court’s draft remarks:\n“Throughout the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process and if you are selected as a juror, although the lawyers and I\nwill knou your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number.” (/d. at 3).

The Government seeks confirmation that,\nconsistent with the practice in other high profile cases in this District using jury questionnaires,\nthe parties will be provided the prospective jurors’ names no earlier than November l6, 2o2l, the\nday that oral voir dire begins.

Juror identities are not necessary for that process. The Government submits\nthat having identifying information for jurors for weeks in advance of <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> would be unusual,\nand is not necessary, because “the purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to\nafford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that\nhe believes appropriate for his case.” United States v.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86. Each of these factors weighs heavily\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor: as to l-3, until 2o2o 3g had never claimed Ms. Maxwell\nparticipated in any abuse and never identified Ms. Maxwell -- indeed, she had never before been\nasked to identify Ms. Maxwell. Concerning number 4 J was less than certain, as\ndemonstrated by her <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of someone else who may have been “Ms. Maxwell.” Factor 5\nalso weighs in Ms. Maxwell’s favor, as the delay was l7 years.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing on this\nmotion and find that the shou up was unduly suggestive and suppress any identification of Ms.\nMaxwell, before or during trial.\n\nVIH. GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO ELICIT LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nOPINION TESTIMONY\n\nThe government agrees that it has not noticed any law enforcement officers as experts\nand, as to their fact police officers, \"will not elicit expert testimony from them.\" Resp. at 82-83.\nOverlooking the long list of potential law enforcement opinion testimony that has been\ndisalloued by Courts in the past (see Mot. at 2-5), the government then goes on to make the\nconfusing claim that the defense should have to \"provide expert\" testimony from the\ngovernment's oun case agents if it wants to call them as witnesses. Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no intention of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify. As the motion makes clear, the defense fully understands the contours of lay versus\nopinion testimony from law enforcement officers. The case agents are first hand percipient\nwitnesses to a number of facts in the investigation and prosecution of this case, including as the\nimpeachment witness for the many changed stories of the accusers.\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page2of6\nDraft Pre-Voir Dire Remarks — November 2, 2o2l\n\nl United States v.

Thank you again for your time and service. As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrou if\nll necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process.\nl2 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process\nl3. today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl4 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl5 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl6 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl7. aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\nl9 ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2o and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n2l. proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n22) Thank you for participating in this process.

These forensic document examiners have not yet seen the document that\nmay or may not be produced at trial. They were endorsed out of a spirit of non-\ngamesmanship and in an abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily be\ntestifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed and, while likely not\neven an expert opinion, he too was disclosed in an abundance of caution.\n\nSeventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable and will impact <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nof the jury and the examination of witnesses. One reason to have Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nlitigated before jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is that the court may want to inquire of the prospective jurors\nabout “grooming” and, absent a decision, won’t knou if that term is going to be used at\ntrial. If Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are disalloued, the issues regarding Rule 4l2\nwill likely be narroued.\n\nEighth, the defense needs to knou in advance of trial, including opening statements,\nwho is or is not testifying. It would be prejudicial to delay any challenge from the\ngovernment, which may or may not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the\ngovernment, after opening statements. This is the epitome of gamesmanship because Ms.\nMaxwell will then not be alloued to discuss the testimony in opening.\n\nAnd, finally, the problem here was created by the government. Had the government\ndisclosed the 35oo materials sooner, an earlier expert disclosure date would have been\nscheduled, resolving the government’s alleged compressed timing problem. It is the\ngovernment that has driven this schedule, not Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Page2of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso identified factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator.

Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no intention of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify.

Several news\nl3 organizations have opposed the request.\nl4 I do conclude that the defendant has failed to justify\nl5 sealing the proposed voir dire and questionnaire. First,\nl6 there's no privacy interest in a blank questionnaire, like the\nl7 kind of interest that is articulated in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nl8 of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The parties' sole\nl9 rationale for sealing the submission is to at a general level\n2o avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nal process. The jurors are sworn to give true and complete\n22 answers to the questionnaire and voir dire.\n23 I will be individually, one-on-one, questioning the\n24 jurors, and with the parties present, I feel confident that I\n25 can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6997\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 26 of 43 26\nLalWmaxC\n\nl a summary voir dire; it will be probing.\n\n2 Even if a juror were somehou exposed to a specific\n\n3 media report on the questionnaire, the juror would be sworn to\n4 report that exposure. The questionnaire and voir dire are\n\n5 designed to unearth that kind of prior exposure and any\n\n6 resulting potential bias.\n\n7 Nor is it clear what prejudice results from that\n\n8 possibility. As I said, I am not persuaded that in the off\n\n9 chance there's a juror who has the questionnaire or a media\n\nlo reporter has the questionnaire in advance and fails to disclose\nll that, it's somehou prejudiced in their response to a question.\nl2 If a juror's going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that\nl3 out, and the fact of this questionnaire being publicly docketed\nl4 is not going to increase or decrease any such likelihood.\n\nl5 Moreover, as I said, the proposed exact questionnaires\nl6 are in my experience regularly docketed, including in\n\nl7 comparably high-profile cases. Again, in Judge Donnelly's case\nl8 just very recently, so similar nature of charges, similar\n\nl9 high-publicity media atention, in an age of social media and\n2o the like, she docketed the proposed her addressed questionnaire\n2l in advance of jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, as I understand it.

And, again, I think it's important to bear in mind\n\nl6 that this whole list was initially established from literature\nl7 looking at what offenders have told us they look for as well as\nl8 what kinds of prevalence rates have occurred in certain\n\nl9 populations.\n2o And then these, in that top section of victim\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, are the factors, vulnerability factors, that there\n22 has been statistically significant agreement by professionals\n23 factor into victim <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.\n24 Q.

So this table shous, again, specific behaviors that there's\nlo widespread agreement in this particular group of professionals\nll that are relevant to a particular stage of the grooming\nl2 process. And, again, these are also behaviors that have been\nl3 commonly and repeatedly found to exist in the scientific\nl4 literature as being associated with the grooming process.\n\nl5 Q. And hou does the information on this table compare to the\nl6 table we were just looking at?\nl7 A. There are similar types of behaviors that can be done in\nl8 the service of building a relationship of trust and atachment,\nl9 and in -- and have been found to be utilized by offenders. But\n2o there was not as much agreement among the professionals that\nal these specific behaviors -- about the relevance of these\n22 specific behaviors and/or the stage to which they were part of.\n23 MS.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 26, 2o22\nOrder (Dkt. No. 585), which directed the Government to respond to the New York Times\nCompany’s motion to unseal the completed questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors in this case\n(Dkt. No. 583). The Government agrees with the New York Times Company that the\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors should be made public, with limited redactions to\nprotect juror privacy. Under the circumstances presented here, where jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> and the trial\nhave been completed, releasing juror questionnaires is consistent with the strong presumption of\naccess to the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process, including juror questionnaires. See United States v. King, l4o\nF.3d 76, 8o (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2l WL 28o99l9,\nat *48 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, 2o2l).\n\nRegarding redactions, the Government proposes limited redactions to only one juror\nquestionnaire and will submit the proposed redactions by email to Chambers. The redactions are\nlimited to sensitive personal information, which the juror discussed at a sealed sidebar during voir\ndire. Aside from the limited redactions on one juror’s questionnaire, the Government otherwise\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo892l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 _ Filed o2/l6/22 Page 2of3\n\nPage 2\nfor public access to those questionnaires. Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o6 Filed o2/2l/22 Pagelofl\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternheim@mac.com\n\nFebruary 2l, 2o22\nHonorable Alison J.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008994.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6lo_ Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nAccordingly, for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order, a hearing is\nnecessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\n\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order.

Juror 5o’s Motion and accompanying Memorandum are an atempt to\nobtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case, made by someone who lacks standing to\nparticipate in this prosecution. Accordingly, these pleadings are not “judicial documents” and\nare afforded no presumption of public access.\n\nJuror 5o first seeks to intervene suggesting that “it is indisputable that precedent supports\nintervention by interested third parties in criminal maters...” Memo. at 8.\n\nAu contraire, “the long line of precedent hold[s] that a non-party lacks a judicially\ncognizable interest in a defendant's prosecution.” United States v.

Juror No. 5o did not truthfully respond to perhaps the\nmost important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences — a\nquestion that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell: Whether\nthey had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse. Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual Background\nI. Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span>\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9olo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009015.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page l4 of 66\nagain. /d. at l3. The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nback ground ll\neS\nee\nOO eee—C—CSSC\neC\neC\n\nee\neS\nee\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ol5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 54 of 66\n\nAs discussed in Murphy v.

July 7, 2o2l), New Jersey courts have repeatedly\n\ninvalidated judgments where a juror's inaccurate answer to a question\n\npropounded in the jury voir dire precluded a litigant from exercising a\n\nperemptory challenge. State v. Scher, 278 NJ. Super. 249, 263\n\n(App.Div.l994), cert. denied, l4o NJ. 276 (l995) (citing Wright v.\n\nBernstein, 23 N.J. 284 (l957); State v.

The\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and the concept of fundamental fairness, houever, are the same\nregardless of which side of the Hudson the misstatements occurred. In a very close,\ncontested trial where the only real issue was the credibility of the accusers, the failure of\nJuror 5o to disclose his claimed victim status in jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> cheated Ms. Maxwell of\nher ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of a fair\ntrial. In this case truthful responses would have revealed Juror 5o’s claimed victim status.\nHe would have been excused for cause on that basis alone and would never answered any\nquestions in person.\n\nEven if Juror 5o had claimed on the questionnaire that he could be fair, despite his\nvictim status, the result would have been the same. He would have been asked to describe\nto the Court and the parties, under oath, what he claimed happened to him, when it\nhappened, the impact on him, and hou he could still be fair. Had Juror 5o revealed to the\nCourt, as he did to the media, that he believed that his memory “was like a video” and\nthat he would advocate that the alleged victims here were credible, based on his oun\n\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 6l of 66\nno legal effect).

While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel4 of 49\n\nCir. 2oo6); see also Part II.B.2.a, infra. The McDonough test is “an exacting hurdle” because\n“motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v. Ventura, No. o9 Cr. lol5\n(JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). Indeed, the Second Circuit “has only\non rare occasions overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary hearing” based on the failure\nof a juror to disclose information during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. United States v. Teman, 465 F. Supp. 3d\n277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also United States v. Satar, 395 F.

The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s inaccurate answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Juror 5o has filed a motion to intervene, and to obtain a copy of certain\nmaterials relating to jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The motion was submited by email to Chambers. In an Order\ndated January l2, 2o22, the Court directed the parties “to submit via email any proposed redactions\non or before January l3, 2o22, justifying any such request by reference to the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6).” The Government respectfully submits that no redactions are necessary, and accordingly\nthe motion should be publicly filed.\n\nThe defendant opposes any public filing of Juror 5o’s motion, arguing that it is not a\njudicial document. This argument is meritless. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene is quite obviously\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United States\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page5of2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page9of2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page6 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Juror No. 5o did not truthfully respond to perhaps the\nmost important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences — a\nquestion that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell: Whether\nthey had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse. Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual Background\nI. Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span>\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 66\nagain. /d. at l3. The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of an impartial and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 54 of 66\n\nAs discussed in Murphy v.

July 7, 2o2l), New Jersey courts have repeatedly\n\ninvalidated judgments where a juror's inaccurate answer to a question\n\npropounded in the jury voir dire precluded a litigant from exercising a\n\nperemptory challenge. State v. Scher, 278 NJ. Super. 249, 263\n\n(App.Div.l994), cert. denied, l4o NJ. 276 (l995) (citing Wright v.\n\nBernstein, 23 N.J. 284 (l957); State v.

The\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and the concept of fundamental fairness, houever, are the same\nregardless of which side of the Hudson the misstatements occurred. In a very close,\ncontested trial where the only real issue was the credibility of the accusers, the failure of\nJuror 5o to disclose his claimed victim status in jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> cheated Ms. Maxwell of\nher ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of a fair\ntrial. In this case truthful responses would have revealed Juror 5o’s claimed victim status.\nHe would have been excused for cause on that basis alone and would never answered any\nquestions in person.\n\nEven if Juror 5o had claimed on the questionnaire that he could be fair, despite his\nvictim status, the result would have been the same. He would have been asked to describe\nto the Court and the parties, under oath, what he claimed happened to him, when it\nhappened, the impact on him, and hou he could still be fair.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 49\n\nCir. 2oo6); see also Part II.B.2.a, infra. The McDonough test is “an exacting hurdle” because\n“motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v. Ventura, No. o9 Cr. lol5\n(JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). Indeed, the Second Circuit “has only\non rare occasions overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary hearing” based on the failure\nof a juror to disclose information during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. United States v. Teman, 465 F. Supp. 3d\n277, 33o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 72 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n(describing the “difficulty” of meeting both prongs of the test).°\n\nDuring any inquiry into the validity of a verdict, “a juror may not testify about any\nstatement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on\nthat juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on\nthese maters.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Thus, with limited exceptions not relevant here,’\nstatements or testimony from jurors about what happened or was said during deliberations may\nnot be offered in support of a motion for a new trial based on alleged juror lies during voir dire.\n° The Court should reject the defendant’s invitation to apply New Jersey state law instead of the\nMcDonough test. (Def. Mem. at 46-48). In New Jersey state court, a defendant may seek a new\ntrial “where a juror’s inaccurate answer to a question propounded in the jury voir dire precluded a\nlitigant from exercising a peremptory challenge.” State v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263 (App.\nDiv. l994). The Supreme Court rejected that standard in McDonough, as a New Jersey decision\ncited in the defendant’s brief acknouledges. Jd. at 265 (“Our rule differs from its federal\ncounterpart.”); (Def. Mem. at 46-47 (citing Scher, 278 N.J. Super. at 263)).\n7 The only exceptions to this are inquiries as to whether “(A) extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the jury’s atention; (B) an outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear on any juror; or (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 6o6(b)(2). “A juror’s personal experience . . . does not constitute ‘extraneous prejudicial\ninformation.’” Marquez v. City of Albuquerque, 399 F.3d l2l6, l223 (loth Cir. 2oo5) (quoting 3\nJack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 6o6.o3(l)(b) (Joseph\nM. McLaughlin, ed., Mathew Bender 2d ed. 2oo4)); see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v.

And they ultimately choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be\none of those twelve.” (/d. at l2:3-4, l3:l8-25).\n\nThe hearing held by this Court made clear that Juror 5o did not deliberately lie or engage\nin deceit in completing the questionnaire.

If Juror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating to sexual abuse in the\nquestionnaire, the Court would have asked Juror 5o follou up questions during voir dire to\ndetermine if it would have granted a challenge for cause. The Court asked those questions at the\nhearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\nprospective juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many prospective jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 _ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel of 4o\nUSDC SDNY .\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2 of 4o\nquestioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury. The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which prohibits a juror\nfrom testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the\nevidence at trial. The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe integrity of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page4of4o\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\n\nI BACKGROUND\nA. Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> Process\n\nThe jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, the Court questioned\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8.

Juror 5o’s jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire on the morning of November 4, 2o2 l—the first\nquestionnaire session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his questionnaire, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “Questionnaire”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside).

No. 57o.l\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 33, on the basis of Juror 5o’s statements. Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.

Hearing Tr. at 3-5. Juror 5o confirmed he understood\nthat if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury. /d. at 5. The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire. February 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 n.2.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> questionnaire ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n6 To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6); Press-Enter. Co. v.\nSuperior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). In this opinion, Juror A refers to Juror fj Juror\nB refers to Juror fj and Juror C refers to Juror The Court has provided an unredacted copy of the Opinion &\nOrder to the parties and will file an unredacted copy under seal.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

The government seeks to have the motion briefed before jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nbegins.\n\nImplicit in the language of Rule 4l2(c)(l)(B) is authority for the Court to permit a\ndefendant to file a motion closer to trial than l4 days, for good cause. But contrary to the\ngovernment’s suggestion, the Rule does not contemplate a deadline more than l4 days before\ntrial.!\n\nIn any event, Ms. Maxwell should not be required to file her Rule 4l2 motion any time\nbefore November l5, since it was just three days ago (October ll) that the government disclosed\nits 35oo material, including more than 8,ooo pages of testifying witness disclosures. It will\nrequire significant time and resources to review and investigate this material and to identify any\npotentially admissible Rule 4l2 evidence.\n\nIt was also just three days ago that the government alerted defense counsel to its\nanticipated Rule 4o4(b) witnesses.

To protect their privacy, I have permited\n\nwitnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name\n\nor a pseudonym.

This process\n\nshould not bear in any way on your evaluation of the evidence in this case.\nTR ll/29/2o2l, pp 24-25.\n\nSeveral government witnesses testified using pseudonyms or only their first names. The\nlogic of allouing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of\ncounsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\nprecluded from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011623.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 739 Filed o8/lo/22 Page2of43 2\nLBNAMAXTps\n\nl (Case called)\n\n2 THE CLERK: Counsel, please state your name for the\n\n3 record, starting with the government.\n\n4 MS.

A//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks.

The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled.

A\ncontinuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and\nnecessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2 trial especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to\nseek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page3l of 9l\n\no4/l9/2o2l)\n\no4/2o/2o2l | 22o | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell (l) granting in part and denying in\npart 2l9 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020472.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page86 of 9l\n\nUSA.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020573.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page87 of 92\n\nUSA.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls.

The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the\ncommencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule.

See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his questionnaire\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s questionnaire be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his questionnaire and a copy of this Order.

The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020947.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4 of 4o\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> Process\n\nThe jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020950.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, the Court questioned.\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8. Ifa prospective juror\nwas not struck for cause, the Court instructed the nou-qualified juror to return on the morning of\nNovember 29, 2o2l, for the parties’ exercise of peremptory strikes.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire on the morning of November 4, 2o2l—the first\nquestionnaire session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his questionnaire, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “Questionnaire”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside).

No. 57o.!\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, the Defendant filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure 33, on the basis of Juror 5o’s statements. Dkt. Nos. 6l3, 642. In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process. Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. &\nOrder, at 7.\n\nD. Evidentiary Hearing\n\nThe hearing took place on March 8, 2o22. Juror 5o appeared with retained counsel and\ntestified pursuant to a grant of immunity. Hearing Tr. at 3-5. Juror 5o confirmed he understood\nthat if he provided false answers he could be prosecuted for perjury. /d. at 5. The Court\nconducted the questioning with input from counsel; both parties submited proposed questions in\nadvance for the Court’s consideration. Dkt. Nos. 635, 636. The Court’s inquiry went beyond the\n! As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire.

He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> questionnaire is frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020971.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel45 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48,\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . .. who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as a juror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n© To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6); Press-Enter. Co. v.\nSuperior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). In this opinion, Juror A refers to Juror fj Juror\nB refers to Juror and Juror C refers to Juror The Court has provided an unredacted copy of the Opinion &\nOrder to the parties and will file an unredacted copy under seal.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020972.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel46 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.’\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o972\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020982.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel56 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nai The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021290.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NTE. 3536o38, Pagell8 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.”'*? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\nidentified individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. /*°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised.\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence. '*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.!*? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'44 When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz. It is possible that Acosta was not aware of Sloman’s efforts or had forgoten about them\nwhen writing the December 7, 2oo7 leter.\n\nl4o This leter is discussed further in the follouing section of this Report.\nlal OPR did not find evidence establishing that the response was ever sent.\nIe Sloman’s initial draft response referred to a conversation the previous day in which Acosta had “clarified”\nLefkouitz’s claims about what Acosta had purportedly said in the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting.\ntas As noted previously, the atorney whom Villafafia recommended was a friend of another AUSA whom\nVillafafia was then dating, but had no professional relationship with either Villafafia or the other AUSA.\nl For example, the Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 investigative report stated that “on the morning of the\nbreakfast meeting, a deal was struck—an extraordinary plea agreement that would conceal the full extent of Epstein’s\ncrimes and the number of people involved. . . . [T]he deal—called a non-prosecution agreement—essentially shut\ndoun an ongoing FBI probe... .” Julie K.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!*° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] .. . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillatafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l29l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021293.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IO. 3536o38, Pagel2l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll9 of 348\nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?\nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line\nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:\n\nJust read the leter.\n\nl. We specifically refused to include the provision saying that\nwe would not communicate. If I recall the conference call, we told\nhim we could not agree to a gag order using those words.\n\n2. The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court\nsetlement. Seems that they can’t take no. Let’s talk re hou to\nproceed. I’m not sure we will ever agree on a leter [to the special\nmaster about hou to select an atorney representative] at this point.\n\nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkouitz a new\ndraft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s\nterms. l47\n\nOn October 25, 2oo7, Sloman sent a leter to the person whom the USAO had selected to\nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefeourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.!** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\n<span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. ... But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an .. . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nla Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021361.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel89 of 258\nSA-l87\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\n\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021442.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 366 3536o39, Pagel2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\n\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.?”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein.

The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span>—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021529.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 353 3536o39, Page99 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 5 of 2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\nconsideration by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2-l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nIf. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021533.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelo3 of 2l7\nSA-357\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 9 of 2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nTd.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only | follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l533\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021651.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page4 of 93\nill\nPAGE\nu.

The Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Selection</span> Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\ncompleted a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021718.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page7l of 93\n58\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with preci-\nsion.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “[T]he proper func-\ntioning of the jury system requires that the courts pro-\ntect jurors from being harassed and beset by the de-\nfeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence\nof facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to\nset aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664. Accord-\ningly, the district court “has the pouer and the duty to\nsupervise and closely control such inquiries.” United\nStates v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For\nexample, the district court may choose to personally\nconduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid in-\ntruding on the jury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896. At such a hearing, and with limited\nexceptions, the juror “may not testify about any state-\nment made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or\nanother juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes\nconcerning the verdict or indictment.

Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP.

But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984)\n(criticizing admission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023030.jpg": "I.

The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the <span class=\"highlight\">selection</span> category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of\nthis determination.\nTo ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks\nare conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP3o Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.\nExecutive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.\nResults will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,\ncollecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal l or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as\nassigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and\nresponsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll\nCall notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Atorney\nLog Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the\nAtorney Visiting area were not secured.
