Witnesses Whose Memories Have Failed or Corrupted.\n\nMany potential witnesses have been contacted in relation to this mater and other related\nlitigations. Significant numbers of potential witnesses no longer remember when events may\nhave occurred, who was present, and do not have documents to refresh their memories. One\nexample of the pervasive and prejudicial memory loss relates to the identity of passengers on Mr.\nEpstein’s planes. Dave Rodgers was one of Mr. Epstein’s pilots beginning in l99l. Mr. Rodgers\nkept flight logs, produced in civil litigation and subsequently released or leaked to the media.\nThe logs contain the dates, locations of travel, and a rudimentary list of passengers, often\nidentified only by gender, initials, or one name. Mr. Rodgers destroyed records prior to l994.\nAccording to Mr. Rodgers, without his logs he is unable to recall who was on a particular flight.\nEx. C at 2ll-2l2. And, even with the logs he cannot identify many of the passengers. “Maria”\nmay or may not be a witness in this mater. /d. at 4l. Where the logbook describes “one or two”\nfemales, Mr. Rodgers has no memory of who those people were. /d. at 44-45. Referring to a\nflight involving “Nadia,” Mr. Rodgers testified “I’m not sure what Nadia that would be.” Jd. 58.\nThe widespread dissemination of the flightlogs combined with the vague <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> descriptions\nhas alloued any female who might have been under the age of l8 between l994-2ol3 to claim\nthat they were on the flight and a victim of Epstein.\n\nV.

The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge.

Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 54\nautomobile is deemed to be the possession of all passengers in the automobile unless the firearm\nis found on the person of a particular <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>. See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with possession of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with possession . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual possession of the gun. It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s possession. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely irrelevant to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F.

Indeed, the only question the jury raised in\nthe Note was whether it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element if they found that Ms.\nMaxwell helped arrange Jane’s return flight from New Mexico as opposed to her flight to New\nMexico. /d. Any sexual abuse that occurred in New Mexico was not a violation of New York\nlaw and was therefore an entirely distinct offense from the one charged in the Indictment.\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the interpretation that the jury did not credit Jane’s\ntestimony that Ms. Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s sexual abuse in New York\nand was instead focused on her involvement in the New Mexico conduct. The most important\npiece of evidence corroborating Jane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot,\nDave Rodgers. See GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence offered\nat trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York and New Mexico and when\nthose trips may have taken place. According to the flight logs, there were only two trips that\nJane may have taken while she was under the age of l7, which was significant because to convict\nunder Count Four, the jury had to find that Jane was under l7 years old when the abuse took\nplace. The first was a trip from Palm Beach to New York (Teterboro) on November ll, l996,\nwhen Jane was l6 years old. GX-662-R at 44. The second was a trip from New York\n(Teterboro) to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997, also when Jane was l6 years old. GX-\n662-R at 48. The critical difference between the two trips was that Ms. Maxwell was not a\n<span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> on the first trip to New York but was a <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> on the second trip to New Mexico.\n\nGiven the text of the Jury Note, it is likely that the jurors decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped to arrange, any of Jane’s\ntrips to New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her\ntrip to New Mexico. As a result, the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8943\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008955.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3l of 37\n\nA. Flight Records — <span class=\"highlight\">Passenger</span> Manifests and Shoppers Travel Records\n\nExactly when the accusers traveled across state lines and when the instances of illegal\nsexual activity took place were critical issues at trial. Not only were these dates relevant for the\njury to assess the accuracy of the witness’ recollections of events that had occurred over 2o years\nago, but they were also important because the accusers needed to be younger than l7 years old\nfor the sexual activity to be illegal under New York law. Contemporaneous flight records would\nhave offered the best possible evidence to shou exactly when accusers traveled. The only such\nrecords admited at trial were the flight logs kept by David Rodgers, which were incomplete and\noften identified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like “l female” or “l\nmale.” Rodgers and Larry Visoski testified that the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> manifests also contained\ninformation about the names of the passengers on the flights. Tr. l8l9; l7l-73. Because of the\npassage of time, houever, the flight manifests did not go back to the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nOf particular interest were entries in Rodgers’ flight logs which shoued that someone\nwith Jane’s true first name was a <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> on two flights when Jane was l6 years old — one to\nNew York on November ll, l996, and another to Santa Fe, New Mexico on May 9, l997.\nHouever, because only the first name was listed, the flight logs did not conclusively establish\nthat it was Jane on those flights. Had the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> manifests been available, the defense could\nhave used them to challenge whether Jane was on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s\nrecollection of events.\n\nSimilarly, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Epstein often had his assistants buy\ncommercial plane tickets for people and that they used a travel service called Shoppers Travel to\nbook them. Tr. 2349. Annie Farmer testified that Epstein bought her a commercial ticket to fly\nto New Mexico in the spring of l996, which was the trip where she claimed she was given a\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6of5l\nif they found that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico.”\n(Def. Mot. at l3). The Court was right to reject these arguments during trial.\n\nFirst, the meaning of the jury note is entirely ambiguous. It is at a minimum unclear (l)\nwhich flights are referenced in the note, (2) where the sexual activity was intended to occur, and\n(3) what question is posed by the note.\n\nThe defendant argues that the note’s mention of a flight to New Mexico is a specific\nreference to a l997 flight from New York to New Mexico captured in the flight logs that lists both\nthe defendant and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX 662-R at 48)). The jury\nmay have considered that flight, or some other flight. (See, e.g., GX 662 at 5l (flight to Santa Fe\nfrom Palm Beach with Epstein, the defendant, and “l female”); Tr. 3l6 (testimony from Jane that\nshe sometimes traveled on commercial flights)). If it was that flight, the subsequent flight record\ndeparting Santa Fe did not include the defendant or Jane (see GX 662 at 48), providing no\ninformation about the flight that the defendant thinks was the focus of the jury’s atention. And to\nthe extent it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to New Mexico was New York, so the jury\ncould easily have inferred that the “return” trip was also to New York. That is, the defendant may\nor may not be right about which flight the jury had in mind. And ifthe jury was asking about this\ntrip, the jury could well have been asking about a flight to New York—which, if the defendant\narranged, could have been highly significant and proper evidence of guilt. The defendant’s\npresumption that the jury was focused on this particular trip and specifically on a return flight to\nFlorida with no relevance to the case is mere conjecture.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of5l\nfloun to New York on Epstein’s private jet (see Def. Mot. at l4 (citing GX-662-R at 44)), but\nwould have accepted her much briefer and less detailed testimony about abuse in New Mexico\nsolely because it was corroborated by a flight record.°\n\nThe defendant also speculates that the jury then decided to acquit the defendant on Count\nTwo but not on Count Four because the jury convicted based on the evidence related to the New\nMexico trip. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury acquited the defendant of enticement\nbecause the flight logs shoued that “she was present on the trip [to New Mexico] but said nothing\nabout whether she ‘persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced’ Jane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did\nnot testify about having any interaction with Ms. Maxwell prior to the flight to New Mexico in\nwhich they discussed the trip.” (Def. Mot. at l5). In contrast, the defendant suggests that the jury\nmust have “found that Ms. Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from New\nMexico,” which they took to be sufficient. But there is no specific evidence—not a flight record,\nand not in Jane’s testimony—of hou and to where Jane returned from that particular New Mexico\ntrip, much less that the defendant participated in or made Jane’s travel arrangements. (See Tr.\n3l29-3o (defense referring to the return flight as “going somewhere away from... New Mexico”\nand as “some other flight besides the flight to New Mexico”)). In the defendant’s view, the jury\nrejected nearly all of the evidence relating to Jane for lack of corroboration, and then convicted the\n3 The defendant says that the “critical difference” between those trips is that the defendant was not\nlisted as a <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> on the trip to New York but is listed on the second trip to New Mexico. (Def.\nMot. at l4). That difference, houever, says nothing about whether the jury required a\ncorroborative flight record before crediting Jane’s account of travel to and abuse in New York or\nNew Mexico.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo958l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 43of5l\none example, the defendant claims that Carolyn’s trial testimony that the defendant called her to\nset up massage appointments “could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records.”\n(Def.

The defendant’s claim is entirely speculative; she makes no\nclaim about what Carolyn’s phone records, or those of her mother or then-boyfriend, would have\nshoun, and she ignores that the records may well have helped the Government, not her, if they\nwere available.\n\nAs another example, the defendant argues that had the flight manifests been available for\nthe time period charged in the Indictment, '® she “could have used them to challenge whether Jane\nwas on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s recollection of events.” (/d. at 26).

(Tr. l72). Similarly, Rodgers\ntestified that he turned over the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> manifests that he completed to one of Epstein’s\natorneys. (Tr. l8l9). The defendant has not established that such manifests were not available\ndue to any intentionally manufactured delay. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l,\nlo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973) (“The fact that evidence may be lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment\nstage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the duration. Furthermore, there has been no\nallegation in this case that the destruction of the records was deliberate on the part of either the\ngovernment or trustee.”).\n\n'! The defendant complains that the flight logs kept by Rodgers “were incomplete and often\nidentified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like ‘l female’ or ‘l male’”\nin her efforts to argue that the unavailability of the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> manifests was material. (/d.).

United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR\n54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). Substantial prejudice is a\nstringent standard. The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5—o6 (2d Cir. l982). Actual prejudice “is commonly\ndemonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of\ntime have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4.

As you walked up the airstairs, if you\n2o looked left to the flight deck, the door was closed -- there\n2l was a door there that was always closed.

We had who the passengers were on there, the\nl5 flight time, I think we also had the amount of fuel we would\nl6 purchase on there. And then on the aircraft log, it was really\nl7 for maintenance procedures. It had about engine times,\nl8 aircraft landings, APU times, stuff like that.\nl9 Q. What happened to the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> manifests that you filled\n2o out for Jeffrey Eostein's planes?\nal A.

If there was a <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span> onboard and you didn't knou that\n\n8 person's name, hou did you indicate the presence of that person\n9 in your Logbook?\n\nlo A.

PAU used to be mainly an intel center made up of\n\n6 several different functions such as narcotics, terrorism, and\n\n7 RCLG. RCLG, we were more or less liaisons that would\n\n8 communicate with airline and airport employees in foreign\n\n9 countries.

So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager\nl2 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.\n\nl3 But Jane is listed on several flights in these\n\nl4 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight.

PAU used to be mainly an intel center made up of\n\n6 several different functions such as narcotics, terrorism, and\n\n7 RCLG. RCLG, we were more or less liaisons that would\n\n8 communicate with airline and airport employees in foreign\n\n9 countries.

An airline employee at\na some point manually entered that person's information into\n\n6 their manifest system as opposed to APIS, which is Advanced\n\n7 <span class=\"highlight\">Passenger</span> Information System.

So let's talk about it.\n\n2 Here's Jane's application to Interlochen for the\n\n3 summer of l994. She weighed 9o pounds and she just finished\n\n4 the seventh grade. There can't be any question that Jane was\n\n5 at Interlochen that summer. And there also cannot be any\n\n6 question that Maxwell was there that summer, too.\n\n7 Let's take a look at the flight records.

And they are thanking Epstein for donating the money to\nl9 build a scholarship lodge. Government Exhibit 745 is a\n2o photograph of that lodge.\n2l And most importantly, you knou that Maxwell was at\n22 Interlochen that summer because Maxwell got a leter from\n23 Interlochen in December l994, just months after she'd met Jane\n24 at camp.

You knou that Jane traveled\n2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you\n\n3 also knou it because Alessi told you about that. And you knou\n4 it because the flight records shou it too.\n\n5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in\n6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always\n\n7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just\n\n8 wrote one female or one <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>. Here's an example from\n\n9 January of l995. And, of course, you knou that Maxwell and\n\nlo Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name\nll of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager\nl2 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.\n\nl3 But Jane is listed on several flights in these\n\nl4 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's\n\nl5 November l996, when Jane was just l6 years old. Here she is on\nl6 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the\n\nl7 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.\n\nl8 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane\nl9 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while\n2o Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,\n2l you knou she was there because you look -- if you look at the\n22 second entry right belou that, she's on the flight log leaving\n23 New York the very next flight. That's hou you knou that\n24 Maxwell was in New York too. She's right there.\n25 Here's the next flight where Jane's name appears.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 28 of 257 286l\nLCKVMAX2 Summations —- Ms. Moe\n\nl It's May l997. A flight from Teterboro to New Mexico. They\n\n2 were traveling from New York to New Mexico. On the day of this\n3 flight, Jane was still just l6 years old. The flight log here\n4 shous just Maxwell, Epstein, and Jane. And Jane told you about\n5 going on a trip alone to New Mexico with just Maxwell and\n\n6 Epstein. Why on earth were Maxwell and Epstein flying alone to\n7 New Mexico with a l6-year-old girl? They were doing it for the\n8 same reason they did that to Annie Farmer, ladies and\n\n9 gentlemen.

It's because his testimony is incredibly pouerful\n\nl3 evidence that backs up so much of what these other witnesses\n\nl4 say. But their arguments about him are really just silly.\n\nl5 They spent time talking about the money and the gun.\n\nl6 Remember, Mr. Alessi told you himself he stole money\nl7 from Jeffrey Epstein and he paid it back. Some police report\nl8 says that he was also looking for a gun. So what? Does that\nl9 mean that he would make up an entire story about the defendant?\n2o No. And you knou he told you the truth because he was\n2l corroborated by other evidence. Flight records confirmed that\n22 Jane and Virginia flew on Epstein's planes when they were\n23 minors, just like he told you.

Reversal is “required where, based on a review of the record as a\nwhole, the error was prejudicial or the charge was highly confusing.” Kopstein, 759 F.3d at l72;\nsee also id.

United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR\n54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). Substantial prejudice is a\nstringent standard.

As a result, the jury\nbegan evaluating Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip to see if it\nsupported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question posed by\nthe Jury Note.\n\nThis is also consistent with the jury’s decision to acquit Maxwell on the\nsubstantive enticement offense (Count Two).

(The remaining l5 percent is ouned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein ouns a lavish\nhome—the city’s largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartmeni on elegant Ave. Fach.\n\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 6o Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quated in Michael\nGross’ book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunel “ranks among the\nsleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls\nwere not only harassed but molested.” Nou The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $l million wire\ntransfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2oo4, just as he was seting up MC2. Whether this was a gift\nor a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknoun. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving\nevidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April af\nBrunel's activities, Epstein said “I'm loo percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been\ncharged.} .\nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many\nwere from Eastern Europe and spoke litle English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s Miami office, who also\narranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private\njets.\nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits shou that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests.

Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliou him to receive only a slap on the\nwrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 2o-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—toc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

Bean stated she needed to make money and\nfelt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was\nbrought to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his\nassistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a\nmassage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated\nshe did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if\nEpstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not,\nhouever he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he\nclimaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the\narea. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to\nEpstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to\nthe lobby.\n\nI located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and atempted to\ncontact her on several occasions. I called 56l-856-26l7 and spoke\nwith Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach\nwhere she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to\nmeet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another\nappointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have\natempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative\nresults.\n\nOn February l3, 2oo6, I met with David Rodgers at 73l8 Heathley Drive\nin Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke\nwith Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since l99l.\nHe flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.\nRodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers\nstated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would\nbe no way of knouing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent\nflight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.\nRodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did\n\n‘remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not\nknou who the passengers are. When he prepares the <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>\nmanifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knous by name, Sarah\nand Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male\npassengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.\nMrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her\nhusband consult with an atorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak\nwith the family atorney to inform him of this questioning. I\nexplained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this\ninvestigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers\ncould not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the\narea.\n\n|\nI atempted to locate Britany Beale at 8358 Xanthus Lane in\nWellington. I left my business card for her to return my call.

The first trip was on September l4, 2oo9 when he traveled by\nhelicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach\nCounty by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only\nother <span class=\"highlight\">passenger</span>. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by\nprobation. On August 27, 2oo9 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to\nSikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova\naccompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of\ntransportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights\ntaken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the\nhelicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another\ndocument confirming the September l4, 2oo9 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am\nalso enclosing documents for the August 27, 2oo9 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State\nAtorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of\nnis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with\nprobation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many\nof the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scot Rothstein law\nOne Clearlake Centre, Suite l4oo 25o Australian Avenue South West Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\np 56l.659.83oo 56l.835.869l www.agwpa.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l57\n"};
