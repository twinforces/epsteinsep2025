Indeed, this case would be an unsuitable candi-\ndate for further review for additional reasons as well.\nFirst, unlike the defendants in the cases cited in the pe-\ntition for certiorari, petitioner was not a party to the\nrelevant agreement; only Epstein and the Florida\nUSAO were parties to the NPA. Even assuming that a\nthird party could assert rights under such an agreement\nwith the government, but see United States v. Lopez,\n944 F.2d 33, 37 (lst Cir. l99l) (noting the absence of\n“authority to that effect”), petitioner could do so here\nonly if “the original parties intended the contract to di-\nrectly benefit [her] as [a] third partLy],” United States\nv.

But there is no\nevidence that the parties to the NPA intended for the\ncoconspirators clause to benefit petitioner. See p. 4, su-\npra. The government was not even aware of petitioner’s\nrole in Epstein’s scheme at that time. See Pet. App.\nl25a-l26a.\n\nSecond, even if the Florida USAO had purported to\nbind all other USAOs in the NPA, it would have lacked\nauthority to do so. See General Int. Ins. Co. v. Ruggles,\n25 U.S. (l2 Wheat.) 4o8, 4l3 (l827) (“It is a general rule\napplicable to agencies of every <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>, that the\nagent cannot bind his principal, except in maters com-\ning within the scope of his authority.”). Under DOJ pol-\nicy at the time the Epstein NPA was entered, a USAO\ncould bind other districts in an NPA only if it obtained\nthe approval of those districts or the Criminal Division.\nPet.

No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever\nbeen brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved. The Non-\nProsecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal\ncharges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal\ncriminal charges against Epstein. Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges\nagainst Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that:\n\non the authority of R.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001167.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeaGeck 5 Ob 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 25 of 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.’ The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Witnesses Whose Memories Have Failed or Corrupted.\n\nMany potential witnesses have been contacted in relation to this mater and other related\nlitigations. Significant numbers of potential witnesses no longer remember when events may\nhave occurred, who was present, and do not have documents to refresh their memories. One\nexample of the pervasive and prejudicial memory loss relates to the identity of passengers on Mr.\nEpstein’s planes. Dave Rodgers was one of Mr. Epstein’s pilots beginning in l99l. Mr. Rodgers\nkept flight logs, produced in civil litigation and subsequently released or leaked to the media.\nThe logs contain the dates, locations of travel, and a rudimentary list of passengers, often\nidentified only by gender, initials, or one name. Mr. Rodgers destroyed records prior to l994.\nAccording to Mr. Rodgers, without his logs he is unable to recall who was on a particular flight.\nEx. C at 2ll-2l2. And, even with the logs he cannot identify many of the passengers. “Maria”\nmay or may not be a witness in this mater. /d. at 4l.

Indeed, there is no reason to believe that a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether\nshe was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def.

Aside from rank speculation loosely\npremised on an anonymously sourced news report, the defendant offers nothing to support her\nassertion that “Boies Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.\n3 at 2) (emphasis in original), or that AUSA-l’s February 2ol6 meeting with Boies Schiller (as it\nactually occurred) undercut the accuracy of the Government’s representations to Chief Judge\nMcMahon, or played any role in the Government opening its investigation in November 2ol8.\n\n9l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003119.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 239\nconspiracy is timely.

Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l89 of 239\npublic, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”'4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for selection of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3293", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 274 of 348\nB.

This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements\n\nIn Hamling v. United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7-l8 (l974), the United States Supreme\nCourt explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply seting forth the offense in the\nwords of the statute may not suffice:\n\nOur prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the\n\nelements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the\n\ncharge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an\nacquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is\ngenerally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the\nstatute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,\nwithout any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to\nconstitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the\nstatute may be used in the general <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of an offence, but it must be\naccompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform\n\nthe accused of the specific offence, coming under the general <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>, with\n\nwhich [she] is charged. (cleaned up).\n\nThe government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without\nuncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and\nillusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot\nadequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information\nnecessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any\nmeaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to\nanswer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3838", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its possession that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for selection of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 275 of 349\nB.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7).

In that\ninterview, she described meeting “an older lady with short black hair and an unknoun accent”—a\n<span class=\"highlight\">description</span> that is consistent with the defendant’s appearance—at her first meeting with Epstein.\nIn a. Minor Victim-4 was deposed, during which she explained that she sometimes called the\nhouse to get work, and she would talk to an employee or “Maxwell.” Later in the deposition, she\nadded that the same employee or “Maxwell” would contact her when Epstein wanted her to come.\n\nThis Office first interviewed Minor Victim-4 in July 2o2o.

Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the identification procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book.

She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain.

On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v.

For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim.

This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of one infamous and controversial legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons. In the follouing case, the alleged victim never recanted\nher claim, and her allegations were never determined to be false.

AK does not remember one\nway or the other if any of the atorneys referenced the possibility of perjury.\n\no AK recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have the same challenges.\nAK recalls thinking in her mind that if the depositions were about the underlying\nconduct that had all of the issues that gave AK pause after the meeting (length of\ntime that had passed, sense there must have been a reason SDFL resolved the case\nthe way they did) were not alleviated by a perjury-based prosecution.\n\no AK does not recall ever knouing anything about the substance of the depositions\nand does not remember anyone sending her a deposition transcript.\n\no AK does not remember who had been deposed or who might have been the\nsubject of a possible perjury investigation.\n\no No investigation into perjury was ever opened.\n\ne AK took no further action re Epstein after calling Sean Watson.\n\no Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knous that she\ntook no action after the call to Sean Watson.

In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\nphotograph in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court identification will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law. The defense has\ndemonstrated no unfair prejudice that might warrant a limiting instruction, and the defense’s\nproposed instructions would only confuse the jury. The jury will be instructed to consider only\n\n53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6762", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 65 of 84\n\nAs set forth in Counts Five and Six of the Indictment, Minor Victim-4 was trafficked by\nthe defendant and Jeffrey Epstein from approximately 2ool to 2oo4.

In that\ninterview, she described meeting “an older lady with short black hair and an unknoun accent”—a\n<span class=\"highlight\">description</span> that is consistent with the defendant’s appearance—at her first meeting with Epstein.\nIn a. Minor Victim-4 was deposed, during which she explained that she sometimes called the\nhouse to get work, and she would talk to an employee or “Maxwell.” Later in the deposition, she\nadded that the same employee or “Maxwell” would contact her when Epstein wanted her to come.\n\nThis Office first interviewed Minor Victim-4 in July 2o2o. During that meeting, Minor\nVictim-4 spoke about her many interactions with the defendant. She did so again at the\nGovernment’s meetings with her in August 2o2o, and at multiple meetings in January 2o2l.\n\nThe Government met Minor Victim-4 again in June 2o2l for several meetings. During one\nof those meetings, the Government shoued Minor Victim-4 a photo book containing 2o photos.\nThe Government asked Minor Victim-4 to review each photograph in the book and to indicate\nwhether she recognized anyone in the book. The Government explained that just because someone\nis in the book, it does not mean that Minor Victim-4 knouns that person or that the person is in\ntrouble.

There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer resolution than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006779.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7l of 84\nprior to the incident,” or alternatively, if “if a witness gets a good look at the defendant during the\ncourse of a crime”); United States v.

June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\nidentification . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

Ms.\nMaxwell strongly disputes that suggestion. Notably, as the Court can tell, the government did\nnot offer any evidence (or any offer of proof in their Response) that this document was in fact\n\nCSCC\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6896", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006920.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 52\n\nThe facts about J interaction with Ms. Maxwell are hotly disputed. Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 52\nspeculating that the accusers have already been found credible by someone, or that their decision\nis a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at 79. As explained by numerous cases,\nhaving any witness refer to themselves or another witness as a \"victim\" is the very height of\nimproper vouching. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. l2l, l3l, 442 P.3d 58l, 59o (2ol9)\n(\"another witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the complaining witness as a 'victim' conveys an opinion that\nthe complaining witness is telling the truth. That is what the vouching rule is intended to\nprevent.\"); Wigg, supra.\n\nFinally, the government contends that Dr. Rocchio can use the word \"victim\" in reference\nto \"victims of sexual abuse generally,\" but her use of the term is even more problematic. For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim. The danger of confusion to a jury is that anyone treated by Dr. Rochio\nmust have been a victim. As the Wigg court recognized, there will be a \"danger of unfair\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6926", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 455 Filed ll/l2/2l Page2of3\nPage 2\n\nSS\nPe (ll/ol/2l Tr. at lo:8-ll).

(See Gov’t Mot. in\nLimine, Dkt. No. 38o, at l6 n.7 (making this request)); see May 6, 2ol9 Text Order, Raniere, l8\nCr. 2o4 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y.) (“Sketch artists . .. may not draw exact likenesses of jurors or witnesses\nother than co-defendants should they testify ....”). It would defeat the purpose of the Court’s\norder if the exact likeness of those witnesses could be drawn and subsequently publicized in the\nmedia. Although courtroom sketch artists might voluntarily elect not to sketch these witness’s\nfaces, the Government seeks an order so it can provide certainty to these witnesses in advance of\ntheir testimony.\n\n' The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although\nthis leter is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed\nredactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the witnesses whom the Court\nhas authorized to testify using pseudonyms or their first names.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo695l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 54 of l27 54\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl MR.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 8 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, wallpaper, and artwork shouing nude women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os.

The government, therefore, has not\nauthenticated the photos, and the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\n\nThe government devotes six pages of its leter to the 2ol9 photos of the massage room.\nGov. Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o.

Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8.

Jane testified primarily about being sexually\nabused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:l6-3l5:l9. Jane also testified that\nshe traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was l4, l5 and l6 and was\nsexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 3l6:2-324:2o.

According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 33 of 37\nwhich would have dated her trip to New Mexico, or when Epstein bought tickets to the\nBroadway production of The Lion King for Jane, which she had originally told the FBI she saw\non her first trip to New York.

Phone Records\n\nContemporaneous phone records for Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, the accusers, and others that\ncould have been used to rebut the government’s proof were also not available to the defense. For\nexample, Carolyn testified that Ms. Maxwell would call her to set up massage appointments. Tr.\nl527. This was important evidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the sex trafficking charges in Counts\nFive and Six. Carolyn’s claim could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records.\nHouever, because a complete set of Ms. Maxwell’s phone records—as well as phone records for\nCarolyn, her mother, and her boyfriend—were not available, the defense could not challenge this\nclaim.\n\nD. Property Records\n\nThe defense also did not have access to property records for Epstein’s various residences,\nwhich would have rebuted the accusers’ testimony concerning the timing of the alleged sexual\nabuse. For example, Jane testified that she began being sexually molested by Epstein in his\nhome in New York when she was l4 years old. Tr. 3l6-32o. Jane described the house as\nfollous:\n\n[I]t looked more like a building than a house. It was eight stories, his massive\n\neight-story house building where you walk through these giant doors and then\n\nthere was, like, another security door to go in. And it had an elevator and it was\n\neight stories.\nTr. 3l7. It is clear that Jane was describing Epstein’s tounhouse on East 7l* Street.

Had property records for the 7l*' Street tounhouse been\navailable, they could have rebuted Jane’s testimony and challenged the accuracy of her\nrecollection.\n\nSimilarly, when Jane testified about her trip to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she\nwas “l5 or l6,” she recalled staying at a “giant ranch sort of in the middle of nouhere ... [which]\nseemed very empty on the interior.” Tr. 32l. From her <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>, it is clear that Jane was\nreferring to the large ranch house that Epstein constructed on the property, and not the triple-\nwide trailer where he stayed while the large house was under construction. The defense had\nsignificant reason to believe that the large ranch house was not completed until the end of the\nl99os, when Jane would have been closer to l8 or l9 years old. But because property records\nshouing the dates of construction were not available, the defense could not challenge Jane’s\nrecollection with contrary documentary evidence.\n\nE. Deceased Witnesses\n\nFinally, in the over 2o-year period that elapsed from the time of the charged conduct to\nthe time of trial, numerous potential witnesses who could have provided evidence contradicting\nthe government’s proof had died. In addition to the ones already mentioned in our previous\nfilings, the follouing individuals, among others, were no longer available to the defense:\n\ne Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi — Mr. Pinto and Mr. Salhi were architects who\nbuilt, renovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences, including the house\nin Palm Beach, the New York residence, and the ranch in New Mexico. The\ndefense believes they could have established (i) when Epstein moved into the 7l“\nStreet tounhouse and what it looked like inside over the relevant time period, (i)\nwhen the large ranch house was built, and (i) that the Palm Beach residence was\nbeing renovated for almost a year in the mid-l99os and that Epstein had to move\ninto a rental house during renovation.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications.

Juror 5o also indicated that he “[a]bsolutely”\nfelt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their job “very seriously because we took\nit as, this could be our sister, our sister could be on trial here,” and therefore “[w]e really have to\ncomb through the evidence and make sure we have enough proof to say that she’s either guilty or\nnot.” (Ud. at 5). When describing deliberations, Juror 5o indicated that the jury began its\ndeliberations “by reading the instructions page by page” and then “worked methodically through\neach count starting with count 2,” which was the only charge on which the jury did not convict.\n(/d. at 8-9). Juror 5o further explained hou the jury “wrote out lists of evidence on a white board\nand atached post-it notes as they built the case for each as they saw it and deliberated touards\nconsensus.” (/d. at 9). He also “said he never felt pressure from either the judge or the rest of the\njurors to reach a verdict,” and that “[t]he prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n(Id. at 9, l2).\nTo be clear, the Government does not believe that the foregoing statements are admissible in this\nproceeding; they are described here in response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror\n5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of deliberations.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009868.jpg": "l/26/22, 8:52PM Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-Bebis GhidaineMEReN [uBAInifally dbubed docibark/ cdr sayPaGaers Of 4\nDuring jury selection, hundreds of prospective jurors were given questionnaires asking, among\nother things, if they or anyone in their families had experienced sexual abuse, court records\nshou.\n\nFor those who answered yes, the judge in the case asked during follou-up questioning if it would\naffect their ability to serve as a fair or impartial juror, the records shou.\n\nScoty David said he did not recall being asked about his experience during follou-up\nquestioning, knoun as voir dire.

His juror number, which is listed on the sheet, was among the l8 chosen as\njurors or alternates.\n\nMaxwell's defense lawyers argued that the women's memories had been corrupted over the\nyears and that they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell.\n\nScoty David said several jurors initially were not sure whether to convict Maxwell on the sex\ntrafficking count, which is backed up by the testimony of a woman named Carolyn who said she\nwas l4 when Epstein began abusing her in 2oo2.\n\nBut he said some jurors changed their minds after hearing the personal story of one juror who\nsaid she grew up poor.

As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page5of23\ndescribed above. See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions.

The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.).

In an abundance of caution,\nthe Government is providing additional <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of Examiner Flatley’s anticipated testimony.\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic\nexamination of the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his\ndetermination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy\nof one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact\ncopy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran\na hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the\nimages, which are identical.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5ofl2\nKelly Bovino to testify that they did not participate in group sexualized massages with Jane,\nEpstein, and the defendant. The Court should preclude this testimony, which does not contradict\nJane’s, and is in any event improper impeachment about a topic of cross-examination that is\ncollateral to the case.\n\nFirst, the anticipated testimony does not contradict Jane’s. Jane testified that she had told\nthe Government that she remembered group sexualized massages involving “Eva,” “Michelle,”\nand “Kelly.” Defense counsel did not ask Jane, and Jane did not testify, that these people were\nEva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino. The defense had an opportunity to elicit specific\nnames or identities from Jane, such as by eliciting a last name or pointing to a photograph, but they\nchose not to do so. Indeed, defense counsel elicited no <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of Eva, and only elicited that\nMichelle was “short.” (Tr. 527). With respect to Kelly, defense counsel only asked whether Jane\ntold the Government that Kelly was an older model whose last name Jane knew—but then chose\nnot to elicit that last name. (/d.)\n\nHaving failed to develop the record, defense counsel cannot nou atempt to impeach Jane’s\ntestimony by calling specific individuals they claim are Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Indeed, as\ndefense counsel is aware, Jane had previously been asked in meetings with the Government about\nEva Dubin, and she answered that she knew Dubin and “does not remember DUBIN being\ninvolved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o at l. That is, Jane knous who Eva Dubin is and has denied\nthat Eva Dubin was involved in sexualized massages. See id.! Testimony from Eva Dubin that\n' In her interviews with the Government, Jane has not always agreed that another “Eva” exists who\nparticipated in massages, as she testified on the stand. Compare 35o9-oo8 at 4 (recalling that Eva\nwould join in) and 35o9-oo9 at 7 (unclear notation in the notes underlying 35o9-oo8 about the\nname of the person who joined the massage) with 35o9-o2o at 2 (not recalling another Eva). But\nJane has been consistent in saying that she knous Eva Dubin and that Jane had no personal\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 _ Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It is Ms. Maxwell’s position that any post-2oo4 statements by\nEpstein or other alleged co-conspirators were not in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue in this\ncase.\n\nThe first exemplar is a statement allegedly from Epstein to CC-l claiming that Ms.\nMaxwell “used to find girls for him.” This statement, or statements like it, cannot have been\nmade either in the course of or in furtherance of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more\nthan “idle chater.” Casual conversation about “past events,” “idle chater” between co-\nconspirators, or “merely narrative descriptions by one coconspirator of the acts of another” do\nnot qualify as statements in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Heinemann, 8ol F.2d\n86, 95 (2d Cir. l986); United States v. Lieberman, 637 F.2d 95, lo2 (2d Cir. l98o) (challenged\ntestimony “smack[ed] of nothing more than casual conversation about past events. It is difficult\nto envision hou it would have furthered the conspiracy.”).\n\nDuring 2oo5, according to the witness, she, Sarah Kellen, an (and\nothers) were actively involved in soliciting females for Jeffrey Epstein. At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said. The entire quote from the proffer is telling.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s untimely disclosure of expert opinion testimony\nto be offered by Computer Forensic Examiner Stephen Flatley of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation’s Computer Analysis Response Team. As explained belou, this Court should\npreclude Examiner Flatley from offering the newly-disclosed expert opinion testimony—\neverything newly disclosed in the November 26 disclosure, the December 3 email, or the\nDecember 5 email.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOn September l5, the government wrote to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel to describe the\ntestimony it expected to elicit from Examiner Flatley. The government insisted Examiner Flatley\nwould not offer expert opinions. Instead, the government claimed Examiner Flatley would offer\nfact testimony about the steps he took to extract and clone certain devices seized under a search\nwarrant. This was the full <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the expected testimony:\n\nThe Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner Flatley will\n\ntestify about his extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l7 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 of lo\nThe Honorable Alison J.

First, there is\nnothing evidentiary or relevant about gg truc namc. ys\nES Second, unlike Ms.\nMaxwell, the government does not have a constitutional right to confrontation. The government\ncan fully cross-examine ggg without publicly disclosing her name.\n\nPublication of J true identity is unnecessary and unreasonable, just as this\nCourt found it was with the alleged victims and Mat and Shawn. As the Court recognized in\nAlvarado v. Burge, “Testifying by giving an identifying number [or alias] rather than a [true]\nname does not necessarily curtail any trial rights. The cross-examiner can question the witness’\nactivities ... without regard to the witness’ name, and similarly has an opportunity to see and\nhear that which he testifies about.” No. 5 Civ. l85l(AKH), 2oo6 WL l84oo2o, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nJune 3o, 2oo6).\n\nThis Court should permit ggg to testify using a pseudonym.\n\nB. Michelle Healy\n\nMichelle Healy has a substantial personal privacy interest in testifying using her first\nname only. During her testimony, Jane alleged that “Michelle” participated in sexualized\nmassages and orgies with Mr. Epstein. From Jane’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of “Michelle” in her testimony\nand her prior statements, it is clear that she is referring to Michelle Healy.

This walk-through and\n\n6 these photographs were taken in 2oo5, which are three years\n\n7 later. So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo\n\n8 was there.\n\n9 So I mean the government is making the argument that\nlo these important people may have seen these photographs or the\nll fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument\nl2 that the people in Epstein's orbit would have knoun about this,\nl3 including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony\nl4 that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to\nl5 this case.\n\nl6 THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art\nl7 and photographs.\nl8 MR.

I received a leter\n\n2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request\n\n3 for a limiting instruction with respect to the next anticipated\n4 witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\n5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over\n6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time\n\n7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's\n8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this\n9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as\n\nlo irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I\n\nll concluded based on the government's proffer that she has\n\nl2 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act\n\nl3 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 4o4(b).\nl4 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, houever, I\n\nl5 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of details of the sexual conduct that does not form\nl7 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting instruction\nl8 was required.\n\nl9 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to\n2o include in the limiting instruction a statement that I\n2l instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual\n22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with\n23 Mr. Epstein.

The government argues that these photos\n\nl8 corroborate Jane's testimony that Epstein used vibrators and\n\nl9 back massagers of different sizes in abusing her. The Court\n2o will exclude these photos.\n2l First, these items are highly moveable, such that a\n22 photo taken decades later is not probative of the items that\n23 Epstein ouned at the time that Jane testified she was abused.\n24 Second, the government has not presented any testimony\n25 that the massagers in the photos match or are similar to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2762", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012918.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l67 of 26l l328\nLC6Cmax5 McHugh —- cross\n\nl they've purchased, right?\n\n2 MS.

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court recognized when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein. (Tr. 82). The Indictment itself contains a <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the accounts\nthese victims have provided law enforcement, which corroborate each other in meaningful part.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo72", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020085.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBGlANt DEctuMerf loo2 Filed6Ra38/?tgPageP Staf 36\n(Def. Ex. S 4l2). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant\nwhen they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was follouing her private security’s\nprotocol when she fled, she did so knouing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,\nnot members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly\nin light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of\nher private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of\nwrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The\ndefense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number\nhad been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only\nnumber of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as\nthe Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade\nnot only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).\n\nThird, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the\nGovernment expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8\nmillion she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than\ncandid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-3o, 72-73). The finances\noutlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has\naccess to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial\nServices (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a\nperson of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive\n> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than\nthose disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more\nfulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could\nprovide a clearer <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted.

Second, the government\nrepresents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person\natorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and _ his\natorneys.” Id.\n\nWhile the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these\nalternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government\ncould have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on\nthese alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December\n2l, 2o2o. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make\nits argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional\nevidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is\nfor presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 2o4 F.3d\nat lol2.\n\nSecond, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns\nthe Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is\ninadequate because the room, by the government’s oun <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>, will still contain a “screen”\nbetween Mr. Robertson and his atorneys.

Because of the overlap in the\nsubstance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back.\nThe Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 4l2 Motion hearing as\nNovember 5, 2o2l.

He said he \"flew through\" the initial questionnaire and also did\nnot recall being asked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he\nwould have answered honestly.\nThe U.S. Atorney's office in Manhatan wrote a leter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan on\nWednesday asking her to conduct an inquiry into the juror's <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of being a victim of\nsexual abuse and his responses to the questionnaire, in light of the juror's statements to outlets\nincluding Reuters.\n\"While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of\ntheir choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit atention by the court,\"\nthe leter read.\nMaxwell's defense atorneys did not respond to requests for comment about Scoty David's\naccount of the jury deliberations or his responses to questions during jury selection.\nJurors were not identified by name during the trial.

The jury charge and limiting instructions at trial thus instructed the\njury on the core of criminality.\n\nSecond, the Government marshaled evidence that captured the core of criminality as pled\nin the Indictment and instructed by the Court.

In her testimony, Jane recalled specific details of Epstein’s New\nYork residence and the sexual acts that occurred there. See Trial Tr. at 3l6-2o.

In her\ntestimony regarding this trip, which spanned only three transcript pages, Jane explained that\nduring the trip Epstein engaged in sexual activity with her similar to what took place in New\nYork. See id. at 32l-23. As explained above, testimony about sexual activity in other states,\nincluding Florida and New Mexico, was relevant to the Defendant’s intent. The testimony was\npart and parcel of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to groom underage girls at Epstein’s\nvarious properties, including in New Mexico and Palm Beach, to then be transported to New\nYork for sexual activity illegal under New York law.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!*° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for selection of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] .. . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillatafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l29l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021450.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page2o of 2l7\nSA-274\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 274 of 348\nB.

The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice.

A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022170.jpg": "SOD-NY-3o2757l\n\nType(s}:lB, lD, lE\n\nItem # Type <span class=\"highlight\">Description</span>\n\nl8l46 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: NYCO32395 - One (l)DVD-R containing image log files and FTK reports for system information on selected items.\n\nlBl45 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCO3239l - Three (3} LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l94o7.\n\nlBl44 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCo32392 - Two(2) LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l5974.\n\nlBl43 Digital (U} one (l} CD labelled \"girl pics nude book 4\"\n\nlBl42 Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l) Envelope containing l VHS tape, 2 cassete tapes & 4 micro cassete tapes\n\nlBl4l Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l} Envelope containing 4 CD's\n\nlBl4o General (U} (2} Bankers box containing various EPSTEIN related case materials\n\nlBl39 General (U} ONE BOX CONTAINING: One pair of black women's couboy boots, size 8\n\nlBl38 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: Disk containing images of Matchmaker shred reconstruction\n\nlBl37 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING: (l} un-framed photo.\n\nlBl36 Digital (U//FOUO) ONE RED ROPE containing: Highly confidential responsive material to include nude and semi nude images and videos from digital evidence items processed by CART.\n\nlBl35 General (U} Box containing Ten yearbooks collected by FBI West Palm Beach Resident Agency\n\nlBl34 General (U} One (l} peach massage table.\n\nlBl33 General (U} One (l} green massage table (PBPDO5-lo24}.\n\nlBl32 General (U} One (l} beige massage table.\n\nlBl3l General (U} One (l} broun massage table.\n\nlBl3o General (U} One flat box containing one (l} large framed photo.\n\nlBl29 General (U} One box containing four (4) framed photos.\n\nlBl28 General (U} One box containing twelve (l2) framed photos.\n\nlBl27 General (U} One box containing five (5} framed photos\n\nlBl26 General (U} One red rope containing: LSJ logbook\n\nlBl25 General (U} One red rope containing:Daily Vessel Trip logs Feb 2, 2ol7 - Feb l6, 2ol7\n\nlBl24 Digital (U) HP Touer S/N: CNV742l3M3 Model: 57o-po56\n\nlBl23 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: l833o6G2UMJXEKGX\n\nlBl22 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: MJO7YG6U Machine type: 9oJo\n\nlBl2l Digital (U} Mac DesktopS/N: W89524CZSPJ model Al3l2\n\nlBl2o Digital (U) HP TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo4Y Model #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll9 Digital (U} HP Desktop TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo5oModel #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll8 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktop\n\nlBll7 Digital (U) 6 Bay with l46GB drivesS/N: MXQ824AlR\n\nlBll6 Digital (U} One box containing Panasonic KX-TDElooS/N: KX-TDAOlo49LCCDoo5398\n\nlBll5 Digital (U} HP server with (4} 5oo GB drivesS/N: MXQ322ol87\n\nlBll4 General (U} Blue prints\n\nlBll3 General (U} One cellophane containing:Boat trip log & employee lists\n\nlBll2 Digital (U) Unifi serverMacID: l735K788A2o463234-8uuU9FF CCID: SWX-UASPRO\n\nlBll Digital (U) Unifi videoM/N: UVC-NVR-2TBMaclD: l829FB4FBE426EA9o\n\nlBllo General (U} One cellophane containing:Paper with passwords on both sides\n\nlBlo9 Digital (U) Unifi Cloud keyM/N: UN-CKFCCID: SWX-UCCKIC 6545A-UCCKMac ID: l843KB4FBE4D3oC69-dcRgm9\n\nlBlo8 Digital (U} CELLOPHANE containing Olympus Digital Voice Recorder\n\nlBlo7 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktopModel #: Al3llS/N: W8o4736DDAS\n\nlBlo6 Digital (U} Dell Inspiron touer with pouer cordReg Model: DI9MQCHFA335\n\nlBlo5 General (U} One red rope containing:LSJ & GSJ Boat Log 2ol9\n\nlBlo4 General (U} Box containing Shredded paper\n\nlBlo3 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING;

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023087.jpg": "Villafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for selection of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.jpg": "promise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l/8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023286.jpg": "B.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct.

The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/<span class=\"highlight\">Description</span> portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023420.jpg": "D. Failure to Assign Epstein a New Cellmate on August 9\nl. Day Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that he worked at MCC New York on August 8, 2ol9, from approximately\n6 a.m. until approximately 2 p.m., and that he was off on August 9, 2ol9. The SHU Lieutenant, whose shift\nended over an hour before the USMS sent the second email regarding Inmate 3's impending transfer, told\nthe OIG he was not aware that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred out of MCC New York, and\ntherefore he did not notify the Captain that Epstein would require a new cellmate. According to the SHU\nLieutenant, as soon as the SHU staff learned that Inmate 3 would be transferred, they should have notified a\nLieutenant on duty. The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the\nOIG that on August 9, 2ol9, they had oversight of the SHU from approximately 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. due to\ntheir position descriptions and because of the SHU Lieutenant’s absence.\nAccording to the MCC New York Staff Roster, on August 9, 2ol9, SHU Officer #l was listed as Senior Officer\nSpecialist 5. Although SHU Officer #l is typically the Officer in Charge, another Senior Officer Specialist told\nthe OIG that, in actuality, he was the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge on August 9 from approximately\n6 a.m. until 2 p.m. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that since he had the most experience and\nseniority, he was considered by everyone to be the SHU Officer in Charge, which the SHU Lieutenant\nconfirmed. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he knew that Epstein had to have a\ncellmate. He said that, as a general practice, every inmate who is transferred from suicide watch and/or\npsychological observation to the SHU is placed with a cellmate. He also confirmed that the SHU Lieutenant\nhad instructed him that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate at all times. According to the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, between July 3o and August 9, 2ol9, he told all other MCC New York staff members\nwho worked in the SHU of Epstein’s cell mate requirement and further stated that everyone who worked in\nthe SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to their knouledge, training,\nand experience.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge confirmed that on the morning of August 9, 2ol9, the SHU staff\nreceived an inmate call out list that listed Inmate 3 as “WAB,” which he explained meant that Inmate 3 was\nbeing removed from MCC New York. He told the OIG that sometime between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., he escorted\nEpstein from the SHU to the atorney conference room for Epstein’s daily legal visit, during which time\nEpstein joked around with him. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that he and Epstein were\naccompanied by CO l, who was escorting Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge. The Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge and CO l both told the OIG that Inmate 3 was escorted to Receiving and Discharge with all of his\nbelongings, and both said that during the escort the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge informed Epstein that\nhe would be assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s departure and the requirement that Epstein have a\ncellmate. In his interview with the OIG, CO l confirmed this conversation between the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge and Epstein, but he did not provide any additional information regarding notifications\nmade either by him or the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the\nOIG that when he and CO l left the SHU with Epstein and Inmate 3, both the Day Watch Operations\nLieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant should have been physically present in the Lieutenants’\nOffice and should have seen that Inmate 3 was departing the institution when they passed the office.\nThe Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that while he did not expect Inmate 3 to return to MCC New York,\nthere had been times when inmates had been escorted to Receiving and Discharge as an expected removal,\nonly to be returned to the SHU later that same day due to unforeseen circumstances. According to the Day\n53\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2342o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023473.jpg": "count. Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was knoun as “ghost counting,”\nsomething he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations Lieutenant or\nsomeone of a higher rank than himself. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having\nauthorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that\nthe Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.\nThe OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving\nand Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the lo p.m. institutional count\nknouing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.\n5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds\nThe OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,\nwhich contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed\nabove, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the\nperformance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP\npolicy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are\nbeing folloued.®\nThe OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct\nany rounds in the SHU. He acknouledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did\nnot sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at lo p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the l2 a.m. count on August lo, which was due to SHU\nstaff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the\ninmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have\nconducted another count and submited a new count slip, but she did not knou if they actually did so.\nDuring her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at\napproximately 4 a.m. on August lo. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed\nthat the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during\nwhich time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station\nin the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not\nrequired to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of\nthe Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty.

The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any\ninstitutional counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift. The Acting Evening Watch Activities\nLieutenant also told the OIG that she conducted one round in the SHU sometime between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which\ntime she walked doun all of the tiers.\nlo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023579.jpg": "VvVt Wal F'!

Cellmate Assignments\n\nDocumentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the\nimportance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes\nconsultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision\nmaking of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members\npresent when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not\naccurately reflect what occurred.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAs was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions\nwere made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff\nmeetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or\nActing Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on\nhousing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate\npresents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a\nsex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.\nMoving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where\nhousing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with\npsychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.\nPlease see the atached checklist.\n\n4, Documentation Accuracy\n\nProfessional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted\n\nin your response. Houever, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in\n\ndocumentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.\n\nAs noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be writen within 24 hours of having\n\nthe information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.\nPreconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative\nexplanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.\n\nPlease develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for\n\nwriting incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include\n\nan outline of the training and evidence of staff who atended the training.\n\nInstitution Response:\n\nAdditional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In\naddition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when\nit is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more\nappropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual\nTraining began the week of January 6, 2o2o, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2o2o.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025116.jpg": "Page 754\n\nInstitution Response: 3. Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making\nrecommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.\nPsychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares\ntheir knouledge with Executive Staff.\nThe psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.\nEpstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

Documentation Accuracy:\n\nThe Reconstruction team indicates it is critical that all descriptions of the incident accurately reflect objective\nIn reference to typographical errors noted in PDS/BEMR notes, the Chief Psychologist has spoken to all psychology\nstaff members concerning proof reading all documents entered to reduce typos and to improve information accuracy.\nAdditionally, there is a second Staff Psychologist in the department which helps reduce the workload on current\npsychologists, allouing more time for documentation review.\n\nRegarding the Reconstruction team’s concerns in reference to Mr. Epstein’s expunged incident report, staff shall\ncontinue to follou Program Statement 527o.o9, Inmate Discipline Program in writing incident reports as\nappropriate. As more complex maters (including atempted suicide) warrant, Special Investigative Services staff\nwill conduct appropriate investigations and make a determination as to whether an incident report is warranted.\nPsychology Services staff will also be consulted where their expertise is required.\n\nThe Reconstruction team stated medical staff conducted Mr. Epstein’s Intake Screening late. SENTRY records\nreflect Mr. Epstein arrived in MCC New York’s Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area on July 6, 2ol9, at\napproximately 9:24 p.m. His medical Intake Screening was conducted at approximately 9:38 p.m., by Physician\nAssistant (PAP ie fon the same night and approximately l4 minutes after his arrival in R&D. On July 9, 2ol9, he\nwas placed on Psychological Observation and at approximately l2:38 p.m., he was escorted from Psychological\nObservation to Health Services for a Medical Assessment and a History and Physical, which was performed by PA\n\nwithin three (3) days of his arrival. According to Program Statement 6o3l.o4, Patient Care, a provider\nmust perform a History and Physical within l4 days of the inmate arriving at BOP facility. The History and Physical\nand Intake Screening were conducted timely and in accordance to policy.\n\nRegarding use of the incorrect Suicide Watch Log and the re-creation thereof, the Chief Psychologist and Drug\nAbuse Coordinator counseled the Drug Treatment Specialist (DTS) concerning her documentation in the suicide\nwatch log book. There was no ill-intent on the part of the DTS as all log books were maintained; the original log\nbook writen by the officer and the one documented by the DTS. The DTS indicated a desire to assist the officer as\nhe had writen in the wrong log book. Specifically, he wrote in the inmate companion log book rather than the staff\nlog book. Houever, she was informed that this is not her role and she is not to document in a log book for anyone\nelse observing an inmate on suicide watch. In the future, only the staff member watching the inmate on suicide\nwatch and Operations Lieutenants document in the suicide watch log book. Log books are nou being closely\nmonitored on a daily basis by the Chief Psychologist.\nIncomplete entries were noted in the BP-292s. SHU training is conducted quarterly, in which emphasis will be\nplaced on the importance of proper 292 documentation. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review 292s ona daily\nbasis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum. 292s will be printed for the previous week every\nSunday, and the SHU Lieutenant will acquire any needed signatures from the respective OICs in a handwriten\nmanner.\n\nThe Reconstruction team findings noted discrepancies in the procedures approved for Psychological Observation.\n\ne\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25ll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025131.jpg": "Page 799\nForm 583 Report of Incident\nIncident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: Skipper-Sot, S.

Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY <span class=\"highlight\">DESCRIPTION</span>\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMR)E™ \"Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell.

It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many\nassociates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\n\n_ Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY <span class=\"highlight\">DESCRIPTION</span>\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027318.jpg": "Form 583 Report of Incident\nIncident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: Skipper-Sot, S.

The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was\nwaiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage.\nRobson stated “I knou” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.\n\nThe victim was shoun a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim\nimmediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated\nsimultaneously.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the\nInvestigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone\n56l-3o8-o282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an atempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The\nvictim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the\nmore you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Toun of Palm Beach was notified,\nand trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the\nvictim’s name at ll:oo am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at\nEpstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.\n\nIt should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the interior of the\nhouse was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which\nEpstein was the victim, and found the victims <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the house to be accurate.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach.\nRobson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our\narrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to\nRobson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time\nshe may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she\nunderstood.

The victim returned to the kitchen, where Robson was\n\nwaiting for her. The victim made a comment to Robson she was paid three hundred dollars for the massage.\n\nRobson stated “I knou” and revealed she had received two hundred for bringing her to Epstein.\n\nThe victim was shoun a photo line up with Epstein’s picture placed in position five. The victim\n\nimmediately identified Epstein as the subject who massaged her vaginal area with the vibrator and masturbated\n\n| simultaneously.\n\n| During the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for the victim to assist with the\nInvestigation. At our direction, the victim conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone\n56l-3o8-o282. The victim, spoke with Robson in an atempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. The\nvictim, asked Robson, what did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the\n\n| more you get paid.” Supervisor Tony Higgins of the Sanitation Bureau of the Toun of Palm Beach was notified,\nand trash was collected at the residence. It revealed telephone messages for Epstein which stated Haley and the\nvictim’s name at ll:oo am. This was the time frame Robson had informed the victim to be ready to go work at\nEpstein’s house. This arrangement was tape recorded from the victims voice mail.\n\nIt should be noted that during the taped interview with the victim, the <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the interior of the\nhouse was given. I personally have been in the house for a previous investigation at the El Brillo house in which\nEpstein was the victim, and found the victims <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of the house to be accurate.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, Haley Robson was contacted at her home in Royal Palm Beach.\nRobson agreed to come to the station voluntarily to answer questions pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein. Upon our\narrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to\nRobson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave at any time\nshe may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she\n\n| understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked hou she became in contact with Epstein.\nRobson stated back when she turned l7 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy\nBeach Resort in Rivera Beach.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst. Visitors report a\nstufted poodle is on the piano. The house, said one visitor. is like what Hollywood might imagine when\nfoes to shou the supernch.

Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly\nmade Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no\nfootman: he loved luxury and, in his oun words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who\ncould shou the rich hou to live with their money. “I want people to understand the pouer, the\nresponsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his pouers seemed magical. “I\nthink it’s all done with mirrors,” says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and\nlost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.\nNext: Epstein's Icarus moment.\na iS, EAS we Be) ee\npad... es, oy ek A ee ae\nBo RT Ae\nfm Fae 2 ee in:\na4 fo fey ok ‘Gyan ss ty a Wal\n. * ae a Bp 2 se\n* WE eee alsa 5 + id «pS — — _ r Pe \"\nThe New York Times\nRedux)\nStroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so\ndarn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, | never saw him work. Anybody |\nknou that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also\nto identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an\nextremely short atention span. Why?— it’s not that he’s bored.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone.

After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology.

Indeed, this case would be an unsuitable candi-\ndate for further review for additional reasons as well.\nFirst, unlike the defendants in the cases cited in the pe-\ntition for certiorari, petitioner was not a party to the\nrelevant agreement; only Epstein and the Florida\nUSAO were parties to the NPA. Even assuming that a\nthird party could assert rights under such an agreement\nwith the government, but see United States v. Lopez,\n944 F.2d 33, 37 (lst Cir. l99l) (noting the absence of\n“authority to that effect”), petitioner could do so here\nonly if “the original parties intended the contract to di-\nrectly benefit [her] as [a] third partLy],” United States\nv. Andreas, 2l6 F.3d 645, 663 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,\n53l U.S. lol4 (2ooo); see Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa\nClara County, 563 U.S. llo, ll7 (2oll). But there is no\nevidence that the parties to the NPA intended for the\ncoconspirators clause to benefit petitioner. See p. 4, su-\npra. The government was not even aware of petitioner’s\nrole in Epstein’s scheme at that time. See Pet. App.\nl25a-l26a.\n\nSecond, even if the Florida USAO had purported to\nbind all other USAOs in the NPA, it would have lacked\nauthority to do so. See General Int. Ins. Co. v. Ruggles,\n25 U.S. (l2 Wheat.) 4o8, 4l3 (l827) (“It is a general rule\napplicable to agencies of every <span class=\"highlight\">description</span>, that the\nagent cannot bind his principal, except in maters com-\ning within the scope of his authority.”). Under DOJ pol-\nicy at the time the Epstein NPA was entered, a USAO\ncould bind other districts in an NPA only if it obtained\nthe approval of those districts or the Criminal Division.\nPet.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n° In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023087.tif": "Villafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\n2. The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n% OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them. As noted in the commentary to USAM § 9-27.7lo,\n49\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023129.tif": "Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their breakfast meeting discussion, Acosta told OPR that there were\n“several instances” in which Lefkouitz and other defense counsel mischaracterized something he\nor an AUSA said, in a way that was misleading.\n\nEmails shou that, immediately after the breakfast, Acosta phoned Sloman, who then\nemailed to Lefkouitz a revision to the Addendum language they had been negotiating and who\nalso later reported to Villafafia that Lefkouitz’s “suggested revision has been rejected.” Other\nemails shou that the parties continued to be at odds about the proposed language for the NPA\naddendum for several days after the breakfast meeting.\n\nC. Acosta Agrees to the Defense Request to Postpone Epstein’s Guilty Plea; the\nParties Continue to Negotiate Issues concerning the Atorney Representative\nand Finally Reach Agreement on the NPA Addendum\n\nA week after his breakfast meeting with Acosta, Lefkouitz—citing a scheduling conflict—\nsent Acosta an email seeking his agreement to postpone Epstein’s entry of his guilty plea in state\ncourt from October 26, 2oo7, the date agreed to in the NPA, to November 2o, 2oo7. In his email,\nLefkouitz reported that the State Atorney’s Office had agreed to the postponement, and he noted\nthat Acosta had said during the breakfast meeting that he “didn’t want to dictate a schedule to the\nstate.”!4° Acosta solicited input from Sloman, who later that day emailed Lefkouitz and agreed\nto the postponement.\n\nWith Lourie having departed from the USAO, Sloman became more involved in\nnegotiating the NPA addendum than he had been in the negotiations leading to the NPA, and he\nquickly came up against the problem Villafafia and Lourie had faced: the defense atorneys\ncontinued to negotiate provisions to which they had seemingly already agreed. Between October\nl2 and l9, 2oo7, in a series of email exchanges and phone conversations, Acosta, Sloman,\nVillafafia, and Lefkouitz continued working on language for the NPA addendum addressing the\nprocess for selection of the atorney representative and describing which of the representative’s\nactivities Epstein would be required to reimburse. Although it appeared that progress was being\nmade touards reaching agreement on the terms of an addendum, on October l9, 2oo7, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman identifying “areas of concern” with a proposal the USAO had made days before.\nSloman forwarded this email to Acosta, noting that it “re-ploughs some of what we accomplished\nthis week,” and raised “unnecessary” issues. Sloman reported to Acosta that a victim in New York\nhad filed a civil lawsuit against Epstein, and Villafafia was concerned that “this may be the real\nreason for the delay in the... plea. She thinks that [Epstein] . . . want[s] to knock that lawsuit out\nbefore the guilty plea to deter others.” Sloman also alerted Acosta that newspaper reports\nindicated that Epstein had planted false stories in the press in an atempt to discredit the victims.\nalmost three weeks before the breakfast meeting occurred. OPR discusses the breakfast meeting further in its analysis\nat Chapter Two, Part Three, Section IV.E.2.\n\nl45 Assuming Acosta made the remark Lefkouitz atributed to him, it was consistent with the position Acosta\nhad taken before the NPA was signed. As noted previously, during the NPA negotiations, Acosta had instructed\nVillafafia to omit language requiring the State Atorney’s Office to take action by a certain date, because he was “not\ncomfortable with requiring the State” to comply with a specific deadline. During his interview, Acosta told OPR that\n“we as federal prosecutors are not going to walk in and dictate to the state atorney.”\n9l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023200.tif": "promise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023286.tif": "B.

The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical <span class=\"highlight\">description</span> of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my\nbasic research work without any strings atached.\nlo\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323o"};
