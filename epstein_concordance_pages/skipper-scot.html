Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\n, |\nDOJ-OGR-ooo236l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023618.jpg": "Shirley <span class=\"highlight\">Skipper-Scot</span>\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: 646-836 (SG\nBlack Berry: 646-423-(BI6ia\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks, [I wiht does \"Psychology\nObservation\" status mean?\nJ.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled withinmate’’\n\nHis Case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley <span class=\"highlight\">Skipper-Scot</span>\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nOffice: 646-836[ \"|\n\nBlack Berry: 646-423-4oo |\n\nDHE (DFC) a\n\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\n\nThanks.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU).

Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHousing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate\n\nHis case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley <span class=\"highlight\">Skipper-Scot</span>\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nne Page 4l8\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2475l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024752.jpg": "Page l53\nNew York, New York lUUU/\nOffice: 646-836\nBlack Berry: 646-423)\" \"|\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks.

Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from\nsuicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population seting. The C&A officer is responsible for\nentering the proper assignment.\nOnce an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and\nLieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.\nThe e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for\na cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in\nBEMR/PDS.\nPsychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of\ninmates on a watch status.\n2. Rounds: 3o-minute rounds are required by P55oo.l4, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.\nInstitution Response: 2. Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets\nwill be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must\nobserve all inmates confined in continuous locked doun status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation, at least once in the first 3o minute period of the hour, folloued by another round in the second 3o\nminute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be\nconducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart. All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take\nmore security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video\nreview are being conducted.\n\n3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2ol9\" —\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement\nrepeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk\nfactors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense.

As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been\ninformed to immediately notify the psychology department.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\nHe has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special\n\nHis Case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because\n\nhe requested Protective Custody.\n\nShirley <span class=\"highlight\">Skipper-Scot</span>\n\nAssociate Warden\n\nMCC New York\n\nl5o Park Rou\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nOffice: 646-836\" \"|\n\nBlack Berry: 646-423 BO. |\n\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\n\nThanks.
