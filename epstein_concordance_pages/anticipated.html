Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences.

The Government has reviewed the proposed redactions to the defense leters\ndated November 25, 2o2o and November 3o, 2o2o. Because those proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties, the Government has no objection\nto the defense’s proposed redactions. The Government objects, houever, to the defense request\nfor a sealed in camera hearing to discuss further sealing requests from the defense. As\ndemonstrated by the defense’s recent leters, any request for sealing of third party information can\nbe made in writing with narrouly tailored redactions. Based on defense counsel’s proffers\nregarding the potential harms that may come from publicly identifying proposed cosigners, the\nGovernment has no objection to the redaction and sealed filing of any identifying information for\nthose individuals. Given the availability of redacted filings, the Government sees no reason for an\nentire hearing to be conducted without the opportunity for the public or the victims in this case to\nobserve. Indeed, given that crime victims have a statutory right to be present and heard at any\nproceeding regarding the defendant’s “release,” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), the Government would\nobject to any proceeding addressing aspects of a renewed bail application that was conducted\nentirely in camera.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy: __s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool846\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value.

While the Government expects to call a number of additional\nwitnesses as a result of the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment, including, of course,\nMinor Victim-4, the Government’s overall estimation of the trial length has not significantly\nchanged. In particular, at the July l4, 2o2o conference, the Government estimated that “its case\nin chief would take no more than two weeks,” but “propose[d] blocking three weeks for trial” in\ntotal. (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at 2o).

See, e.g., United States v. Skelos, l5 Cr. 3l7 (KMW) (making\nuse of jury questionnaire provided to venire approximately one week in advance of trial to\nstreamline jury selection); United States v.

See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

[a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. **\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues.

Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 348\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

We did not.” Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY — JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'® Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial.

Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 66 of 349\nI do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the\nshoes of the thought process in 2oo6 and ’o7 when trafficking\nprosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than today, some\njurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and . . . [a] judge’s\ntolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation\non the part of victims... .©\nFinally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning\na sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district\ncourt in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence\nthat differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range. °*\nIn summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,\nThe way the mater came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing\nenough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 8l of 349\nthe period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two\nyears in prison.” The USAO did, houever, consistently reject defense proposals to change other\nterms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.\n\nA.

A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\ney Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was\n\ndesigned to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a\n\npunishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control\n\nsupervision (also knoun as “house arrest”) you will not be alloued to leave your\n\nhome to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,\n\nor many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does\n\nallou you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or atend school\n\nin lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.\nFlorida Dept. of Corrections, Succeeding on Community Control at l, htp:/(www.de.state. fl.us/cc/ccforms/\nSucceeding-on-Community-Control.pdf.\n8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of\nexperience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> there would be ways to “manipulate” a state\nsentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with\nLourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 99 of 349\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution of a criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice.

FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®” Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo.

OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

To begin with, the request appears to be\noverbroad; under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the requested material is\nrelevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. l2, 2ol6). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor\nVictim-2’s first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of\nreferences to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the\nrelevance of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here,\ntoo, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony as\nto specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\ntestimony.\n\nIn addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the relevance of the rest of the diary\nother than the pages she has already received. BSF has represented that the rest of the journal\ndoes not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. Dkt. No. l9l at 5.

Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\nphotograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless. Rule l7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third\nparties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.”\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The Government has represented that the\ndefense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. The Defendant’s request is therefore denied\nas moot.

The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v.

Ms.\nMaxwell’s counsel understand the rules of evidence and the law. Much of what may or may not\nhappen in this trial will depend on the evidence produced by the government. Ms. Maxwell has\nno burden of proof and is not required to respond to hypothetical demands or provide previews\nabout hou she intends to cross examine witnesses. Consistent with prudent judicial practices, the\nCourt should decline to rule on these hypothetical complaints. See Seymour v. Bache & Co., 5o2\nF.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v.

Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\nintroduce evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.l 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (2o2l).\n\nII. Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule. See Dkt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005615.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\n229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll. Dkt. 297.\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government served on defense counsel a short leter entitled\nthe “Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) leter’ (the “Rule 4o4(b) Leter” or the “Leter’’), atached as Exhibit\nA. Init, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (2)\n2\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter. The Government's theory\nof admissibility concerning this post-2oo4 evidence remains unclear.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005618.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 385 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nthe admissibility of the other act evidence.\" Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule. Given\nthe significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally\ndifficult.

Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the\n\nMaterials Qualify as “Direct Evidence” in the Case\n\nThe Rule 4o4(b) Leter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed\nmaterials qualify as \"direct evidence\" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. |\nee\nWm They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the\nIndictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 84\ncorroborative of the accounts of the other Minor Victims.

Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”).

By contrast, the Government notes that it provided the defense with notice\nof its expert on April 23, 2o2l, and the defense filed its motion to preclude on October l8, 2o2l.l\nMoreover, during that time, the Government will be (l) preparing for the November lo,\n2o2l Daubert hearing; (2) responding to the defendant’s motion for reconsideration regarding\ndisclosure of juror names (Dkt.

These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this\ncircuit, United States v. Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d l42 (D. Me. 2olo). After careful\nconsideration of the Defense’s arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court\nconcludes that Dr. Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony is admissible with one exception. The Court\nwill address first why Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion\nthat it will exclude.\n\nFirst, Dr. Rocchio’s method is reliable and well-accepted in her profession. It is for this\nreason that several courts in this circuit have admited the testimony of similar experts, such as\ntestimony on so-called trauma bonding to explain why prostitutes may not flee from their pimps\neven when not physically restrained. In United States v. Kidd, the court admited the testimony,\nfinding it to be “quite common| ]” and accepted in the academic literature. 385 F. Supp. 3d at\n263. Identical testimony was admited by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. l8-\nCr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), Dkt. No. l98 at 27, by Judge Engelmayer in United States v.\nRandall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335 at 24-3o, and by Judge Cote in United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l).\n\nTheir decisions are consistent with the vast majority of courts to consider the admission\nof such experts. A number of courts have admited experts on the particular topic of grooming at\nissue here, a sample of which include the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Romero, l89 F.3d\n576, 585 (7th Cir. l999), the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Hit, 473 F.3d l46, l58 (Sth Cir.\n2oo6), the Ninth Circuit in United States v.

Castillo, 924 F.2d l227, l232 (2d Cir. l99l))). Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions\nmay also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with\nJeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion\nmay become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in\nfully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to\npursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. lo Tr. at l56-57. The Court therefore finds\nthese elements of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony relevant to maters the Defense intends to put in issue\nduring <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the\nother relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding\nconcepts that require expert knouledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a\nwitness’s credibility. Additionally, both Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about sexual abuse’s connection\nto substance abuse and her opinion about delayed disclosure are “are outside the ken of the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagelo of 54\nnames were already public and that some victims had come forward by choice, Judge Garaufis\nfound those facts “irrelevant”: “just because some victims’ names are publicly available does not\nmean that the details of their experiences are already available,” and “the choice of a victim to\npublicly discuss a crime is not analogous to being put on the stand about it, as, in court, the\nvictim will not be able to choose hou and to what level of detail she discusses the crime.” Jd. at\n34 n.l7.\n\nJudge Donnelly reached a similar result in United States v.

The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making the Baseless Argument\nthat the Defendant Was a Victim of Jeffrey Epstein\nIn order for counsel to ask questions or make argument about a fact, counsel must have a\ngood faith basis for advancing that fact. See, e.g., United States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (“Although counsel may explore certain areas of inquiry in a criminal trial without\nfull knouledge of the answer to <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> questions, he must, when confronted with a demand\nfor an offer of proof, provide some good faith basis for questioning that alleges adverse facts.”\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The Government’s years-long investigation has\nnot developed any evidence that the defendant was victimized in any way by Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Government has also met with the defense many times, both prior to presenting this case to a\ngrand jury and when conferring during the pendency of this mater. During one of those\nmeetings, defense counsel made a variety of factual assertions in order to dissuade the\nGovernment from charging the defendant. At no time has the defense represented to the\nGovernment that Epstein victimized the defendant in any manner. In preparing these motions,\nthe Government asked the defense whether they plan to offer such evidence at trial, and defense\ncounsel declined to answer. !!\n'T Ag set forth in the Government’s cover leter, the Government seeks redaction of this section.\nWere this argument discussed in public filings, it would likely result in significant publicity,\nwhich would be highly prejudicial to the Government if in fact there is no good-faith basis for\nthe argument, as the Government suspects will be the case. Accordingly, the Court should\npermit redaction and sealing of this section at least until the conclusion of trial.\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 69\n\nGhislaine Maxwell herby submits her response to the Government’s Omnibus Motions in\nLimine.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe government’s self-described “Motions in Limine” are an ill-founded atempt to:\n(l) improperly obtain advisory rulings from the Court on an undeveloped factual record;\n(2) prematurely, and unconstitutionally, force Ms. Maxwell to reveal defense theories, strategies,\nand cross-examination; (3) improperly limit Ms. Maxwell’s defenses; and (4) inappropriately\nenlist the Court in vouching for the credibility of the accusers by the use of pseudonyms and\nother artifices.\n\nFor the most part, the issues raised by the government cannot, and should not, be\naddressed pretrial because the Court lacks the necessary facts to make intelligent rulings. The\nissues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related to\nthe use of pseudonyms and other artifices fails becausc\nRee 2¢ Limitations suggested by the government will: (l) unconstitutionally\nrestrict Ms. Maxwell’s confrontation rights; (2) run afoul of both her right to a public trial and\nthe First Amendment right to public access, and (3) are simply unworkable as a practical mater\ninviting a mistrial.\n\nA. The True Purpose of a Motion in Limine\n\nThe purpose of a motion in limine is to allou the trial court to rule in advance of trial on\nthe admissibility of certain forecasted evidence. See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 4o n. 2\n(l984) (explaining that the motion in /imine is used to “to exclude <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> prejudicial\nevidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d\nl36, l4l (2d Cir. l996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by\nenabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006428.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 69\n\nThese arguments are about things that have not occurred and may not occur. Ms.\nMaxwell’s counsel understand the rules of evidence and the law. Much of what may or may not\nhappen in this trial will depend on the evidence produced by the government. Ms. Maxwell has\nno burden of proof and is not required to respond to hypothetical demands or provide previews\nabout hou she intends to cross examine witnesses. Consistent with prudent judicial practices, the\nCourt should decline to rule on these hypothetical complaints. See Seymour v. Bache & Co., 5o2\nF. Supp. ll5, ll9 (S.D.N.Y. l98o) (\"In light of the uncertainties surrounding these legal issues, a\npotentially unnecessary, and thus merely advisory, ruling should be avoided.\"); In re Refco Cap.\nMarkets, Ltd.

SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-\nESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW\n\nAt this point, everyone associated with this litigation knous the definition of a “judicial\ndocument.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of\nany item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,\nInc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. l98o). Moreover, after “the evidence has become knoun to the\nmembers of the public, including representatives of the press, through their atendance at a public\nsession of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the\nopportunity of those not physically in atendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,\nwhen it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested\ndocuments were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to\njudicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining\nlitigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public\nmonitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d l43, l5l (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nSuppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly\nproblematic -- many of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings\nthat have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is\nnothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses\nshould be redacted or suppressed.\n\nIl. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”\n\nINAPPROPRIATE\n\nThe government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified \"prior consistent\nstatements\" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense \"challenges the credibility of\nthe testimony\" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at l7. Under the government's\napparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 69\nchoosing to be admited, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a\nnumber of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given \"prior\nstatement\" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent\nstatements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the\ngovernment in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent\nstatement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements\nthey will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact\nconsistent with specific <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> trial testimony, and whether the other foundational\nprerequisites, including Rule 4o3, will be satisfied and hou. Having failed to provide the Court\nwith these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.\n\nA. The 2ol4 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior\n\nConsistent Statements May Be Admited\n\nFirst, the 2ol4 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.\nThe Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for\nadmissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at l7-l8. According to the Advisory\nCommitee Notes:\n\n“The [2ol4] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits\n\non bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility\n\npurposes. It does not allou impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment\n\ndoes not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible\n\npreviously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise\n\nadmissible for rehabilitation are nou admissible substantively as well.”\n\nAs the government correctly notes, prior to 2ol4 the Second Circuit, like many other\ncircuits, admited prior consistent statements \"outside of the context of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B) in\norder to rehabilitate a witness after certain atacks on credibility.\" Mot. at l8 (citing United\nStates v. Pierre, 78l F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. l986)).

R. Evid. 4o4(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended in December\n2o2o, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered,\nan articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that\npurpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this\nCourt's deadline of October ll, the Government opted not to follou the requirements of the Rule\nand should nou be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 4o4(b).\n\nBACKGROUND\nI. 2o2o Amendments to Rule 4o4(b)\n\nRule 4o4 sets forth the requirements for \"Notice in a Criminal Case\" of an intent to\nintroduce evidence under the rule:\n\n“Tn a criminal case, the prosecutor must:\n\n(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at\n\ntrial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;\n\n(B) articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer\n\nthe evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and\n\n(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause,\n\nexcuses lack of pretrial notice.”\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3). In December 2o2o, the Rule was “amended principally to\nimpose additional notice requirements in a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4, Advisory\nCommitee Notes, 2o2o Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to\ngive notice of the “general nature” of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> evidence; thus, “some courts...permit[ted]\nthe government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the\nevidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-\npropensity purpose” (id.).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 442 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\n\nAfter December 2o2o, according to the Advisory Commitee, the new subsection (B)\nrequires that:\n\nThe prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer\n\npursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the\n\nevidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in\n\nlight of this purpose.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must “identify the evidence,”\n“articulate a non-propensity purpose” and a “basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light\nof this purpose” replaced the previous notice requirement only of the “general nature” of\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> evidence. The “advance notice” is “important so that the parties and the court have\nadequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the\nrequirements of Rule 4o3 have been satisfied... .” Jd.\n\nThe new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, “sufficiently ahead\nof trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence.” Rule 4o4(b)(3)(A). “The\n‘air opportunity’ must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface\nevidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut\nthe disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial\ncan proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can “meet” the other act proof. Easy\nto overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act\nevidence.” See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.l 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (2o2l).\n\nII. Rule 4o4(b) Notice in This Case\n\nThe Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it \"adequate time to finalize its\ndetermination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to\" the Rule.

In it, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (a) certain emails purportedly between\nMs. Maxwell and third-party “influential” men whom she allegedly tried to set up on dates, and\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter.

Should the Government\nrequest a \"good-cause\" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 4o4(b) notice, this\nCourt should analyze their excuse with skepticism. \"Prosecutors should be prepared to explain\ntheir change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at\ntrial are one thing. Reasonably <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> proof problems are another. For example, when intent\nis an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not\nforesee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent.”\nWright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to\nprove since July 2o2o. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 4o4(b) notice back\nin May 2o2l. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See\nDkt. 297.\n\nThere is no acceptable excuse for failure to follou the requirements of the Rule.

At first blush, it is hard to see hou they\ncould so qualify. The emails referenced in the Leter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and\ntwo adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early\n2ooos.

The government has apparently abandoned efforts to introduce her\ntestimony as Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nIn their response, the government still fails to comply with the new Rule 4o4(b) notice\nrequirements. First, they do not actually identify the evidence with any specificity, especially\nwith respect to the \"exhibits\" that they hope to introduce through her.

After\n\nl6 that motion I will address the government's motions in order\n\nl7 and then address the remaining defense motions in order.\n\nl8 In the defendant's l2th motion in limine, the defense\nl9 asked the Court to preclude use of the terms \"victim\" and\n2o \"minor victim.\" The motion is denied. Government counsel can\n2l use the word \"victim\" if they're referring to someone alleged\n22 to be a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment, and\n23 they may use the word \"minor\" to describe individuals that\n24 were, at the relevant time period, under the age of consent.\n25 As my colleague, Judge Furman, has explained,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Pagelloofl27 ll\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl to reveal identifying information because knouledge of that\n\n2 information by the jury might be important to its deliberations\n\n3 as to the witness's credibility or knouledgability. That's\n\n4 quoting the Marti case again. In particular, the defense\n\n5 argues that revealing the alleged victims' and witnesses'\n\n6 identities is necessary to probe the nature of the alleged\n\n7 victims' occupations as relevant to the credibility and elicit\n\n8 certain impeachment evidence.\n\n9 I agree that such cross-examination cannot be unduly\nlo limited and the government concedes the same. The government's\nll motions in limine l5, n. 6; government reply at l7 to l8. And\nl2 I will ensure that it is not.\n\nl3 My decision today grants the government's request to\nl4 limit the public disclosure of the alleged victims and some\nl5 witnesses' names and other specifically identifying\nl6 information, such as the specific names of current and past\nl7 employers, names of family members and addresses.\nl8 Limiting disclosure of the specifically identifying\nl9 information does not limit the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> cross-examination\n2o that the defense described in its papers. All lines of inquiry\n2l the defense outlined in its response are available without\n22 disclosing specific names of employers or other specifically\n23 identifying information.

If,\n\n3 after good faith effort in that regard is made and the defense\n4 at some point feels they have hit a wall and can articulate a\n\n5 specific need with respect to a particular line of questioning,\n6 they can reraise the issue with opposing counsel and with me.\n\n7 So that's my ruling on that motion. That said, I do\n\n8 strongly encourage the government to speak candidly with the\n\n9 <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witnesses so that they're clear eyed about what\n\nlo this process will entail, the fact that cross-examination will\nll not be curtailed beyond the specific identifying information\n\nl2 that form the basis of the government's request, and the\n\nl3 possibility that despite these measures their identities may\n\nl4 become knoun and revealed to the public.\n\nl5 Should any of those witnesses or the government choose\nl6 not to proceed by pseudonym, the government shall let defense\nl7 counsel and the Court knou.

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a setlement with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 38 of l27 38\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl THE COURT: From your perspective, anything further\n\n2 that could be addressed at this time or needs to be addressed?\n3 MR.

(Def. Mot.\nAtachment A). The subpoena should be quashed as to each of these categories.?\n\nA. Payment Records\n\nThe first category—copies of payments made to the Minor Victims—concerns information\nalready in the defendant’s possession. Indeed, the defendant’s motion cites the amounts received\nby the Minor Victims, which is reflected in their 35oo material (Def. Mot. at 3), and the\nGovernment expects the Minor Victims to testify to those amounts at trial.\n\nAccordingly, this information is “otherwise procurable.” United States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr.\n55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). The subpoena should therefore\nbe quashed. At most, the Court should order production of that information to the Court so that it\nmay be provided to the defense in the unlikely event that the Minor Victims testify inconsistently\nwith their prior statements at trial.\n\nB. Claim Release Forms\n\nThe defendant makes no argument for the relevance of the release forms executed by the\nMinor Victims, and none is apparent to the Government. The Court should therefore quash the\nsubpoena insofar as it calls for that category of information, at least until the defendant explains\nwhat relevant and admissible evidence is contained in the release forms.\n3 The Government has standing to challenge the subpoena because it targets information about\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> Government witnesses, “based on the Government’s ‘interest in preventing any undue\nlengthening of the trial, any undue harassment of the witness and [her] family, and any prejudicial\nover-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.’” United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto (l) the government’s November 5, 2o2l leter in further opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in\nLimine to Exclude Evidence Related to Accuser-3 (Dkt. 387), and (i) the government’s November\n7, 2o2l leter in response to the Court’s order, dated November 6, 2o2l, directing the government\n“to state its position as to whether this <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witness could be deemed a victim of any of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose.” (Dkt. 4l7). For the reasons set forth\nbelou and in our prior motion, the evidence related to Accuser-3 is not direct evidence of any of\nthe conspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment and is improper propensity evidence that should be\nexcluded under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nl. Accuser-3’s Evidence Is Not Direct Evidence of Any Conspiracy Charged in the S2\n\nIndictment\n\nThe Court asked the government to do two things at the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference concerning the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence: (i) provide additional briefing\non why Accuser-3’s evidence could potentially be admited as direct evidence of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five, and (il) outline in further detail Accuser-3’s\n2o498o8.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page2ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See ll/l/2o2l Tr. at 88:5-l6.\nDespite being given these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion of its\nNovember 5 leter rearguing its position that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is direct evidence\nof the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. See ll/5/2o2l\nLtr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3’s evidence is not direct\nproof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:\nThe evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government\ndescribes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in\nCounts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three\ncharge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to\nengage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with\nintent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\nThe parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was l7 at the time she was\nacquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England\nwhere the age of consent is l6. Moreover, she can't recall, and the\ngovernment wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to\ntravel with the defendant when she was l7 or l8. And because the\nalleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant\njurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,\nthe alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or\nseries of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably\nintertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,\nand it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so\nI don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\nll/l/2o2l Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons\nthat the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The government has given the Court no reason to change its initial finding and it\nshould decline to do so.\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 496 Filed ll/22/2l Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT USDC SDNY ioe\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCUMENT\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: ll/22/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page6eof9\nB. Brad Edwards\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Brad Edwards, counsel for Kate, to say that he provided a\nU-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This testimony, too, would not be\nprivileged, but it is irrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nKate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for\na U-Visa. (Tr. l279, l287, l3oo). She acknouledged that Edwards likely atended the meeting,\nbut did not recall whether he provided a U-Visa form to the Government (Tr. l3oo). Kate also\nexplained that her plan is simply to renew her current visa, and that the Government has made no\npromises to assist her. (Tr. l2o7-o8, l295).\n\nThe fact that Edwards provided the Government with a U-Visa application form during a\nmeeting with Kate is not relevant or impeaching of Kate. Rather, it is entirely consistent with\nKate’s testimony—specifically, that she made an inquiry about a U-Visa but was not sure whether\nher lawyer provided the Government with a U-Visa form. And the fact that her lawyer provided\nthe Government with a U-Visa form is not “pouerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Leter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence\nof Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.\nSecond, it is not “pouerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknouledged asking the Government\nabout a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete\nU-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s oun testimony. It does\nnot shou, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she\ncontinues to seek one nou, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind\nabout her immigration status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page/7of9\ntestimony.

She confirmed details, including that she sat\nin mezzanine seats and that Epstein “bragged about geting those seats because he knew the\ndirector,” and that all of that information was conveyed to the Government in response to questions\nabout her timeline from the Government.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of identification is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page2of6\n\nAt a conference on November l, 2o2l, the Court granted the Government’s motion in\nlimine to permit alleged victims to testify under pseudonyms and, as a consequence, to redact\ntheir real identities from exhibits. Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were necessary to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to publicity, harassment, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\nsensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research. It appears, then, that the Defense’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548 _ Filed l2/l5/2l Page4of6\nbreaking nature of the Defense’s request, which was made not pre-trial, as was the Government’s\nrequest for the use of pseudonyms, but instead two days after the Government rested its case.\nThe Defense could and should have <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> potential witnesses’ concerns. If the Defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> calling a witness who refuses to testify, the Defense would have the same tools at its\ndisposal as does the Government to compel that witness’s atendance at trial. The Defense could\nhave, for example, subpoenaed a witness under Rule l7. If the witness resides abroad, the\nDefense could have sought a leter rogatory under 28 U.S.C. § l78l, which is a mechanism that\nthe Second Circuit has repeatedly emphasized. See, e.g., United States v. Brennerman, 8l8 F.\nApp’x 25, 3o (2d Cir. 2o2o) (citing § l78l as a mechanism for a criminal defendant to “secure\ntestimony from the United Kingdom’’); United States v. Lee, 723 F.3d l34, l42 n.6 (2d Cir.\n2ol3). These mechanisms ensure that pseudonyms are not necessary to secure a reluctant\nwitness’s testimony and the Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting pseudonyms.\n\nThird, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for a witness that works as a plain\nclothes law enforcement officer, citing in support a large body of case law in which anonymity\nwas granted for testifying law enforcement officers. Def. Leter at 5. But as the Government\nnotes, the cases relied on by the Defense uniformly involve officers that work undercover such\nthat revealing their true name to the public would subject them to violent retaliation by the\ndefendant or other individuals, or would frustrate their ability to remain undercover. E.g., United\nStates v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8); United States v. Hernandez, No. Sl\nl2 CR 8o9 PKC, 2ol3 WL 3936l85 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2ol3). Even further afield, the Defense\ncites in support a case in which a covert CIA officer testified under a pseudonym. United States\nv. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o). These cases are inapplicable to the present\nrequest as proffered to the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of6\n\nFourth, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for one witness because, under\nthe Government’s theory of the case, she is a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. There are at\nleast two problems with this justification. First, based on the Defense’s current explanation of\nthis witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony, this witness will testify that she was not the target of any\nsexual misconduct by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. She would therefore fall outside the scope of the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, which defines a victim as “a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Though the\nAct’s definition of victim is “expansive,” the Defense has not identified a way in which this\nwitness was harmed, “whether physically, financially, psychologically, or otherwise” by an\noffense allegedly commited by Ms. Maxwell. United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also In re Ippolito, 8ll F. App’x 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (“[O]ne does not\nacquire status under the CVRA based on his oun say-so.”). Second, and relatedly, the Court\nunderstands that this witness will testify that sexual conduct did not occur. Consequently, the\ntestimony does not raise the same risks of embarrassment or harassment as did the other\nwitnesses’ testimony, nor does it risk deterring alleged victims of sexual abuse from coming\nforward in future cases. The Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting testimony under a\npseudonym.\n\nThe Defense’s fifth argument is that the Court permited two non-alleged victims to\ntestify under pseudonyms, which justifies permiting its witnesses to do the same. But as the\nCourt explained, it permited two non-victims to testify under pseudonym only “because the\ndisclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.” Nov.\nl Tr. at 8. The Defense has not identified any similar dynamic here.\n\nLast, the Court emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense’s motion, the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document549 Filed l2/l7/2l Page2of2\n(ll/ol/2l Tr. at l6 (citing United States v.

No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d.

King, 56o F.2d\nl22, l3o (2d Cir. l977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been’’).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial prejudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points’’).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination. See Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3l7 (citing United States v. Spears, l59\nF.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999)). The Defendant provides no basis to conclude that the jury\n\n43\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page l2 of 29\n\nFurthermore, it would be improper for the Court to rely on Carolyn’s recollection and the\nmessage slips to find that the offense conduct lasted until 2oo5 because the government alleged\nin the S2 Indictment that the offense conduct ended “in or about 2oo4,” not “in or about 2oo5.”\nThe initial indictment charged Ms. Maxwell with offenses that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout l997.” (Ind. 9 9, l3, l5, l9). The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\nnevertheless vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect.

Based on all of the information nou before the Court, including a substantially more\ndetailed proffer by the Government as to the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3\n(Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\ntestimony may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\n\nThe Government rightly acknouledged at the November l pretrial conference that Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be found guilty on this witness’s testimony alone for any of the crimes charged\nin the Indictment. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67:l2-25, 68:l3-l9, 69:4-9, 7o:23-7l:2, 72:22-25. As the\nGovernment acknouledged, with respect to the jury’s determination in this case, this witness is\nnot a victim of any of the crimes charged in the Indictment. See id. at 69:4-9; Nov. lo, 2o2l Tr.\nat l64:l9-l65:3.” Houever, evidence of legal conduct can of course be relevant evidence of\nillegality. And conduct that cannot itself form the basis of a conviction can serve as direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir.\n2ol2) (affirming admission of defendant pimp’s relationship with and control over women who\nworked as prostitutes as direct evidence of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) charge). Thus some of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony described above can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe alleged conduct as to Witness-3 was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.\n\nPortions of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony may also serve permissible purposes under Rule\n4o4(b), namely proving motive, intent, and knouledge. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(2). The\nwitness is expected to testify about certain statements by Ms. Maxwell. For example, the\n2 At the November l conference, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to preclude the Government from\nreferring to alleged victims as “victims” and “minor victims.” Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 4. In contrast to the other alleged\nvictim witnesses, it is not (nor could it be) the Government’s litigating position that this witness is a victim of the\ncrimes charged in the Indictment. Given this, the Government may not refer to this witness as a “victim” or a\n“minor victim” in front of the jury. Doing so would constitute prejudicial error for the reasons explained in this\nMemorandum Opinion & Order.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooollo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page4of23\n\nThe probative value of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony must of course be balanced with any\npotential prejudice under Rule 4o3. As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page5of23\ndescribed above. See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. l38 at l3; see also id. at l5. In that case,\nthe Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at l3-l4. The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witness’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,\nany minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the\ncharged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2ool to 2oo4. This\nevidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are\nalleged to have begun in l994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with\nthis witness.). Because the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is precluded from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the proffered testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a conviction for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion. The Defense has submited proposed limiting instructions, and\nthe Government agrees that some sort of instruction is appropriate, although it disagrees with the\nbasis for the instruction. Dkt. No. 452 at 5o n.l2; Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). In\naccordance with this ruling, the Court proposes the follouing instruction before this <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nwitness testifies:\n\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had\n\nwith the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the\n\nrelevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government has charged in the\n\nIndictment. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before\n\nyou, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the Defendant on the basis of\n\nthe testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor\nmay you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThe Court also proposes the follouing instruction before any testimony by other witnesses\nregarding sexual activity that occurred after the relevant age of consent:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct that\n\nshe says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico].

Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2.

Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis.

The Court reserves judgment on the admissibility of Dr. Hall’s fact testimony\n\nFinally, two of Dr. Hall’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> opinions are fact testimony not subject to Rule 7o2.\nSpecifically, Dr. Hall would testify that Alleged Victim 4 told him that she previously disclosed\nother sexual abuse to a prior mental health provider, ae. but did not disclose abuse\nby Epstein to a.

The admission of fact testimony is governed\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 6o2, which requires that the witness have “personal knouledge of the\nmater.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o2. The admission of expert testimony is governed by Rule 7o2, and\napplies to witness who offer opinions who are “qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill,\nexperience, training or education.” Fed. R.

R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G), (b)(l)(C). As the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note,\nthe Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony,\nreduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the\nmerit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Jd. l993 Amend. “Ifa party\nfails to comply with Rule l6, the district court has broad discretion in fashioning a remedy ... .”\nUnited States vy.

Discussion\n\nThe Government will offer testimony tomorrou for which the defense has received ample\nnotice, and there is no reason to preclude any testimony or permit any delayed cross-examination.\n\nFirst, the primary issue concerns Flatley’s discussion of metadata. The Government\nbelieves that Flatley’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony on this subject is properly considered fact testimony.\nFor instance, Flatley is expected to read an exhibit reflecting that the author of a document is\n“emax.” That is pure fact testimony. See, e.g., GX 4l8-B. He is also expected to testify that he\nused a program to confirm, for example, that the metadata reflected in GX 4l8-B is the metadata\nfor GX 4l8. That does not constitute expert opinion, either, because it is based on his investigatory\nfindings, not rooted exclusively in his expertise. See, e.g., United States v.

As noted in the Government’s September l5, 2o2l leter, although the Government\nbelieves that Examiner Flatley’s testimony will not require admission through Rule 7o2 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Government provided expert notice. In an abundance of caution,\nthe Government is providing additional description of Examiner Flatley’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony.\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic\nexamination of the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his\ndetermination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy\nof one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact\ncopy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran\na hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the\nimages, which are identical.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5ofl2\nKelly Bovino to testify that they did not participate in group sexualized massages with Jane,\nEpstein, and the defendant. The Court should preclude this testimony, which does not contradict\nJane’s, and is in any event improper impeachment about a topic of cross-examination that is\ncollateral to the case.\n\nFirst, the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony does not contradict Jane’s. Jane testified that she had told\nthe Government that she remembered group sexualized massages involving “Eva,” “Michelle,”\nand “Kelly.” Defense counsel did not ask Jane, and Jane did not testify, that these people were\nEva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino. The defense had an opportunity to elicit specific\nnames or identities from Jane, such as by eliciting a last name or pointing to a photograph, but they\nchose not to do so. Indeed, defense counsel elicited no description of Eva, and only elicited that\nMichelle was “short.” (Tr. 527). With respect to Kelly, defense counsel only asked whether Jane\ntold the Government that Kelly was an older model whose last name Jane knew—but then chose\nnot to elicit that last name. (/d.)\n\nHaving failed to develop the record, defense counsel cannot nou atempt to impeach Jane’s\ntestimony by calling specific individuals they claim are Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Indeed, as\ndefense counsel is aware, Jane had previously been asked in meetings with the Government about\nEva Dubin, and she answered that she knew Dubin and “does not remember DUBIN being\ninvolved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o at l. That is, Jane knous who Eva Dubin is and has denied\nthat Eva Dubin was involved in sexualized massages. See id.! Testimony from Eva Dubin that\n' In her interviews with the Government, Jane has not always agreed that another “Eva” exists who\nparticipated in massages, as she testified on the stand. Compare 35o9-oo8 at 4 (recalling that Eva\nwould join in) and 35o9-oo9 at 7 (unclear notation in the notes underlying 35o9-oo8 about the\nname of the person who joined the massage) with 35o9-o2o at 2 (not recalling another Eva). But\nJane has been consistent in saying that she knous Eva Dubin and that Jane had no personal\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 ofl2\nYork when she was l7 to atend Professional Children’s School. (Tr. 349).\n\nJane’s sexual activity when she was an adult is entirely collateral to this case. Consistent\nwith Rule 4l2, the parties could not have offered independent evidence about who else participated\nin Jane’s sexual activity over the age of consent. See Dore, 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6 (defining\n“maters which are not collateral” as “those maters which are relevant to the issues in the case and\ncould be independently proven.”). Accordingly, as the Government explained as part of the\nlitigation over Rule 4l2, the Government offered only brief testimony on direct about Jane’s\nrelationships after the age of consent in order to conclude the narrative. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at l6o).\nSpecifically, the Government asked about five questions establishing that, after Jane moved to\nNew York and turned l8, she spent time with the defendant and Epstein and continued engaging\nin sexualized massages. (Tr. 349-5o).\n\nThe defendant proposes to do something quite different. The <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony is, at\nleast in part, an atempt to substantively impeach Jane on the identities of individuals with whom\nshe had adult sexual contact. ee\nee\nee Both are not relevant or subjects of independent proof in\nthis case—they are collateral.\n\nThird, even if the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony did impeach Jane, and even if the testimony were\nabout a non-collateral mater, it is impeachment by contradiction of a fact elicited on cross-\nexamination. This is precisely the sort of impeachment that the rules are intended to prohibit.\nAbsent Jane’s testimony on cross, it would be irrelevant and improper for the defendant to call\nwitnesses to say that they did not have sexual activity with Jane and the defendant.

The economic incentives here are obvious—having setled her\nclaims in 2oo9, Accuser-4 needed new, more sensational information to get more money. The\nEVCP materials thus directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by the\nprosecution at trial—that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein. See\nMendez v. Artuz, 3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (information relevant and “exculpatory . . .\nwhen it directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses”).\n\nAs this Court has already ruled, Witness-3 cannot be called a “victim” of the charged\nconduct because she was not a minor. Even so, this Court ruled that “some of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\ntestimony [from Witness-3] can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that the\nalleged conduct as to [her] was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.” Ms.\nMaxwell and the jury have a right to knou what Witness-3 said the EVCP about the alleged\nabuse she suffered, including hou old she claimed to be when she was abused. If Witness-3\nmisrepresented her age to the EVCP, just as the government was misled by Witness-3 into\nportraying her as a minor to the grand jury and this Court, that fact bears directly on her\ncredibility. Again, it is no coincidence that, after receiving money from the fund, Witness-3 is\nnou telling the government that if asked at trial about “specific dates when things occurred, the\nanswer might be she doesn’t knou.” See 35oo material at 35l3-o59.

There is\n7 no connection between what's been proffered to this jury and\n\n8 what we are hearing nou from defense counsel. The fact that\n\n9 there is an email between a lawyer and a prosecutor suggesting\nlo topics about an interview is a separate mater, but certainly\nll wouldn't support the argument that they themselves had\n\nl2 manipulated their clients and cultivated the stories. That is\nl3 an entirely separate mater, your Honor.\n\nl4 THE COURT: I think the inference is available from —-\nl5 cultivating, so I'm going to allou that. It's unclear to me\n\nl6 what evidence will go to it, but the proffer nou is that it's\nl7 not based on <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony to be elicited from the\n\nl8 atorneys, but it's based on nonprivileged communications\n\nl9 between the atorneys and the government. And so beyond that,\n2o I'm going to let the argument be made, unless the government's\nal position is there is no evidence available from which the\n22 inference of manipulation by the atorneys could be made.\n23 MS.

I received a leter\n\n2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request\n\n3 for a limiting instruction with respect to the next <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\n4 witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.\n\n5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over\n6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time\n\n7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's\n8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this\n9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as\n\nlo irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I\n\nll concluded based on the government's proffer that she has\n\nl2 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act\n\nl3 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 4o4(b).\nl4 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, houever, I\n\nl5 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the\n\nl6 description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form\nl7 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting instruction\nl8 was required.\n\nl9 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to\n2o include in the limiting instruction a statement that I\n2l instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual\n22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with\n23 Mr. Epstein.

Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell,\nl9-lo475-LGS-DCF\nDear Judge Freeman:\n\nPursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in connection with her <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nmotion to stay discovery in this mater. The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion\nconference and deny her <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> motion in its entirety because, as explained belou, each of\nMaxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another atempt to\nunjustifiably delay this litigation.\n\nFirst, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.\n“TA] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been\ncharacterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuiton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d\n83, 98 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). In this Circuit, courts balance the\nfollouing six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal\nproceedings:\n\nl) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented\n\nin the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have\n\nbeen indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously\n\nweighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private\n\ninterests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the\n\npublic interest.\n\nId. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending\na criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a\ncivil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a\nstay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,\nl33 F.R.D. l2, l3-l4 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (emphasis added) (internal citations omited). The Court\nshould deny Maxwell’s motion for a stay without prejudice to her ability to renew her application\nif she is arrested. Until that happens, houever, there are no grounds for a stay.\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019319.jpg": "Case £49% 9ol 6495.osustent Bodine 72o, RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 3 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGeneral’s Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate\nNo. ST-l9-PB-8o (Apr. l4, 2o2o, V.I. Super. Ct.); Notice of Joinder of Motion for Status\nConference Regarding Victim Compensation Fund, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No.\nST-l9-PB-8o (Apr. 29, 2o2o, V.I. Super. Ct.). The claims resolution program is therefore not a\nvalid basis to stay this action without Plaintiffs consent.”\n\nThird, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of\ndiscovery pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion\nto dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s leter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.\nECF No. 48. Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that\nMaxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the leter from defendant\nMaxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the\none previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion\nto dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. l6, 2o2o\nConf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that\ndispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s\nindividual rules. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—l2; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.\n(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case\nmanagement deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nmotion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this mater, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss\nhave not stayed discovery in any other mater against it in this District.\n\nThe Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> motion to stay discovery in this mater in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to\naddress the above issues—the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this\nCourt’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice\nto Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with\nher discovery obligations in this mater, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for\na full, three-week briefing schedule on her <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> motion to stay will only give her another\nincentive to continue to delay. Fact discovery in this mater ends in less than two months, and we\nrespectfully submit that her delay tactics should end nou.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ David Boies\n\nDavid Boies, Esq.\ncc: Counsel of Record (via ECF)\n2 Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiffs sister (and a few other victims) have\nvoluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims resolution program warrants a ruling\nthat Plaintiff must stay her case as well. This makes no sense. Plaintiff and her sister filed separate\nactions and are separate litigants. Plaintiffs sister’s decisions do not bind Plaintiff, nor do any\nother victims’ decisions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool93l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019451.jpg": "Case C2@-Ao-oo484-DGHUDER ODocemek Go, FICE DLIl H2dePavyess of l3\nout, both the Indictment in the criminal case and the Complaint in this action contain allegations\nthat Maxwell “groomed” minor victims by taking them to the movies or shopping, that Epstein\npaid for victims’ education, and that Maxwell facilitated Epstein’s abusive conduct. (See 8/l9/2o\nMenninger Ltr., at 3 (summarizing certain allegations made in both actions and noting that\nparticular allegations in the Indictment “are very similar in time frame and content to those in the\nComplaint’).) The Government, in its submission, has confirmed that the allegations pleaded in\nthis case will necessarily “touch on maters relating to the pending Indictment” (9/4/2o Gov’t\nLtr., at 2), and has also noted that “given the factual overlap between the civil and criminal cases,\nallouing the criminal mater to be resolved in the first instance may result in a narrouing of the\nfactual and legal issues before this Court” (id., at 3). Plaintiff, in her opposition, does not contest\nthat there is substantial overlap between the cases, in terms of the people involved, the relevant\nevidence, or the facts sought to be established. (See generally 8/27/2o Glassman Ltr.) Thus, this\nfactor weighs in favor of granting a stay.\n2. Status of the Criminal Case\n\nThe arguments favoring a stay are also stronger where the criminal case is not merely\nhypothetical or <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, but rather is actively proceeding. In fact, as Maxwell notes,\n‘Tw hether the defendant has been indicted has been described as “the most important factor” to\nbe considered in the balance of factors.’” (8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at 4 (quoting Maldanado v.\nCity of New York, No. l7cv66l8 (AJN), 2ol8 WL 256lo26, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020424.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page38 of 9l\n\no5/o7/2o2l | 273 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited\nthree alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under\npseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's\nmotion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court\nemphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of\ncourse raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning\ninto witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or\notherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968)\n(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to\nprotect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper\ncross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule.

The Defense on\nDecember l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> witnesses to testify under a\npseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited\nthree alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under\npseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's\nmotion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court\nemphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of\ncourse raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning\ninto witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or\notherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 39o U.S. l29, l33 (l968)\n(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to\nprotect a witness \"from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper\ncross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him\").

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nGovernment may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification leter on or\nbefore February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial\nmotion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are\nproposed, the Defense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22,\nand the Government leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are\nFURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal\nthe filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial.

The Government on\nNovember 8, 2o2l, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr.\nLoftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion. On November l5,\n2o2l, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the testimony of the remaining\nsix experts. The Defense filed a response on November l9, 2o2l. The Court addresses the\nmotion to preclude Dr. Hall in this separate opinion. It will address the other five experts\nin public rulings....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... I. Conclusion.\nThe Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Dr. Hall's expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-\nraise its request to admit Dr. Hall as an expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,\nwhich is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the\nDefense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22, and the\nGovernment leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are FURTHER\nORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Leters by both parties must\nbe submited via ECF on or before February ll, 2o22. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

The Court has ordered the Government to disclose all Jencks Act and Giglio material by\nOctober ll, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 297 at l. That date is seven weeks in advance of trial. The Court\nsees no reason to depart from the rule in this district that impeachment material of <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nwitnesses does not warrant an order compelling immediate disclosure. See United States v.\nCampo Flores, No. l5 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2ol6 WL 5946472, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l2, 2ol6).\nSeven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no shouing\nhas been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in\npreparation of her defense.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in possession of prior statements\nthat are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell’s involvement),\nrather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government’s\nobligation to “disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes\nknoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the\npreparation of its case.” Dkt. 68 at l. The context of questions and answers surely maters as to\nwhether a statement (or omission) is exculpatory, impeaching, or neither. It is for the\nGovernment to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations so that\nthe defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44-46 (2d Cir. 2ool). The Government has repeatedly\nconfirmed that it understands those obligations, and that it has met them and will continue to\nmeet them. Accordingly, the motion to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor\nVictim-4’s prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell is denied.\nof objection, the Court presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the\nsame time that as it discloses Jencks Act material.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020962.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel36 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\n\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt.

It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F.

As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48.

She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the questionnaire,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d.

Here, the\nDefendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.\nShe states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for\nEpstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.\nat 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper could have testified that\nthe Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his tounhouse in New York but provides\nlitle basis or detail for that <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,\nsuch speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the\nDefendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.\n65l, 657 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knouing what [an absent\nwitness’s] testimony would have been”).\n\nSecond, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony\ncould not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein\nemployed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those\nresidences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David\nRodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant\ndoes not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who\nwere not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals\nwho were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could\nprovide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not\nexplain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven\nby other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021026.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2oo of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 43 of 45\n\nAnd third, the Defendant does not demonstrate that such witnesses, even if available to\ntestify as the Defendant speculates they may have, would have meaningfully altered her defense\nsuch that she was substantially prejudiced by their absence. Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at\n*4. No witness listed could testify directly to whether or not the Defendant and Epstein sexually\nabused the victims. Rather, each would at best provide additional corroboration of the\nDefendant’s arguments at trial to impeach the witnesses’ credibility as to particular aspects of\ntheir testimony. This falls short of substantial preyudice. United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688,\n694 (2d Cir. l982) (no prejudice where absent witness’s testimony was “at best corroborative on\nminor points”).\n\nSpecifically, the housekeeper’s <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> testimony that the Defendant rarely spent the\nnight at Epstein’s tounhouse and that she and Epstein were not “always” together contradicts\nlitle, if any, of the Government’s case at trial. Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Defendant does not\nclaim that the housekeeper was always aware of the Defendant’s or Epstein’s actions, and so is\nunlikely to have rebuted testimony that at other times and other locations, the Defendant and\nEpstein commited crimes. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4 (absence of a witness not\nprejudicial because unless the witness was with the defendant “every moment,” it would have\nbeen “impossible for him to testify that defendant did not commit the charged crimes”).\n\nThe speculated testimony of Sally Markham—that an individual knoun only as “the\nCountess,” not the Defendant, wrote the household manual—is similarly unhelpful to the\nDefendant’s claim. In considering whether testimony would have been beneficial to the\nDefendant, the Court must consider whether the witness would have been credible and withstood\ncross-examination.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues.

The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.

The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us.

Villafafia told OPR\nthat when Epstein’s atorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a\nstate prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a\nfederal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,\nVillafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-l/2\nyear cap.”\n\nAlthough Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence\nshou that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal\n87 Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.\n\n88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,\n\nThe Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to\n\nincarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program\n\nwhere you are confined to your home unless you are working, atending school,\n\nperforming public service hours, participating in treatment or another special\n\nactivity that has been approved in advance by your officer.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers.

In his leter, Starr\nargued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution ofa criminal case. On the same day, Lefkouitz\nemailed Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan to notify victims about the § 2255 provision\nand alerting Sloman that Epstein’s counsel were seeking a meeting with the Assistant Atorney\nGeneral “to address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”\nof the NPA. After Lourie sent to Sloman a copy of the Starr leter, Sloman forwarded it to\nVillafafia, asking her to prepare a chronology of the plea negotiations and hou the § 2255 provision\nevolved. Villafafia responded that she was “going through all of the ways in which they have tried\nto breach the agreement to convince you guys to let me indict.”\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Lourie consulted with CEOS Chief Oosterban, asking for his\nthoughts on defense counsel’s arguments. At the same time, at Lourie’s request, Villafafia sent\nthe NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterban. Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“olayed no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nIs In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021303.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 | 3536o38, Pagel3l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l29 of 348\nthese victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\nIX. FEBRUARY - JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.!©? Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nto On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillatfafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else.

Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO.

Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\n28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n3o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues.

The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas.

On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\n\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\n\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\n\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\n\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\n\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\n\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\n\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\n\nit is clear that Marie has <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the strongest legal arguments,\n\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\n\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\n\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\n\nfacing.

Oosterban responded to Lourie that he was\n“not thrilled” about the NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,” particularly\nbecause of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA was “prety advantageous for the defendant\nand not all that helpful to the victims.” He opined, houever, that the Assistant Atorney General\nwould not and should not consider or address the NPA “other than to say that she agrees with it.”\nDuring her OPR interview, Fisher did not recall reading Starr’s leter or discussing it with\nOosterban, but believed the comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal\nprosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, houever, that she\n“played no role in” the NPA and did not review or approve the agreement either before or after it\nwas signed.\n\nAs set forth in more detail in Chapter Three of this Report, Villafafia planned to notify the\nvictims about the NPA and its § 2255 provision, as well as about the state plea hearing, and she\nprovided a draft of the notification leter to Lefkouitz for comments. On November 29, 2oo7,\nLefkouitz sent Acosta a leter complaining about the draft notification to the victims. Lefkouitz\nasked the USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until after defense counsel met with Assistant\nAtorney General Fisher, which he <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> would take place the follouing week. Internal\nemails indicate that Lourie contacted Oosterban about his availability for a meeting with Starr,\nbut both Fisher and Lourie told OPR that such a meeting never took place, and OPR found no\nevidence that it did.\n\nAcosta promptly responded to Lefkouitz by leter, directing him to raise his concerns about\nvictim notification with Villafafia or Sloman. Acosta also addressed Epstein’s evident efforts to\nstop the NPA from being enforced:\n\nl52 In a short email to Fisher, the next day, Lourie reported simply: “He was very nice. Kept me on the phone\nfor [a] half hour talking about [P]epperdine,” referring to the law school where Starr served as Dean.\n95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023141.tif": "these victim issues as insurmountable but, based on these alone, the CEOS Trial Atorney\nconsidered a potential prosecution of Epstein to be a “crap shoot.” In addition, she told OPR that\nthere were novel legal issues in the case that also presented difficulties, although she believed these\ndifficulties could be overcome. Shortly after the CEOS Trial Atorney met with the victims,\nhouever, “things just stopped” when Oosterban instructed her to cease her involvement in the\ncase and CEOS engaged in the Criminal Division review sought by Epstein’s defense team.\n\nIX. FEBRUARY —- JUNE 2oo8: THE DEPARTMENT’S REVIEW\n\nEpstein’s defense atorneys sought a broad review from the Department, one that would\n\nencompass the defense complaints about federal jurisdiction, specific terms in the NPA, and the\nvarious allegations of professional misconduct by USAO atorneys and other personnel. The\nDepartment, houever, only reviewed the issue of federal jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA\nor any specific provisions.'®* Nonetheless, the process took several months as the defense\nappealed first to CEOS and the Department’s Criminal Division, and then to the Office of the\nDeputy Atorney General. The chart set forth on the follouing page shous the positions and\nrelationships among the individuals in those offices involved in communicating with the USAO\nor defense beginning in November 2oo7 or in those offices’ reviews, which continued through\nJune 2oo8.\nl62 On February 28, 2oo8, USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior sent to the Civil Rights Division writen\nnotification of the USAO’s “ongoing investigation of a child exploitation mater” involving Epstein and others “that\nmay result in charges of violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l.” USAM § 8-3.l2o required a U.S. Atorney to notify the\nCivil Rights Division, in writing, “[a]t the outset of a criminal investigation . . . that may implicate federal criminal\ncivil rights statutes, .. . and in no event later than ten days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses\nbefore a grand jury.” The provision also required notification to CEOS in cases involving sex trafficking of minors.\nThe writen notification was to identify the targets of the investigation, the factual allegations to be investigated, the\nstatutes which may have been violated, the U.S. Atorney’s assessment of the significance of the case, whether the\ncase was of “national interest,” and the U.S. Atorney’s proposed staffing of the mater.\n\nVillafafia became aware of this requirement in late February 2oo8, and she prepared a writen notification\nthat was edited by Sloman, who discussed it with Acosta. After briefly summarizing the facts, Senior advised:\n\nThe Office anticipates charges of violations of Title l8, United States Code,\nSections 37l, 2422, 2423, and l59l. The investigation of the case by the City of\nPalm Beach Police Department has resulted in press coverage because of the\ntitillating nature of the facts, but we see this case as similar to other “child\nprostitution” cases charged by our office, and not a mater of “national interest”\nas defined by the U.S. Atorney’s Manual.\n\nIn the notification, Senior stated that CEOS “has been involved and is currently reviewing the mater,” he\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the case would be staffed by USAO and Department personnel, and “[i]f we determine that the case should\nbe [charged], a copy [of the charging document] will be forwarded to you.” OPR did not locate a response from the\nCivil Rights Division to the notification.\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.tif": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.4? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it .. . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span>\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence.

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been <span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement.

Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\n3l3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2325l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.tif": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\n<span class=\"highlight\">anticipated</span> the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”*°>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n335 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n336 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8. As early as October 2oo7, the New York Post reported the l8-month sentence and that\n“Tt]he feds have agreed to drop their probe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to\nthe new state charge.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal — Moneyman to Get Jail For Teen Sex Massages,”\nNew York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7.\n337 Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that\nthey don’t like it.” The CEOS Trial Atorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested\nin this prosecution going forward.” Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Atorney also opined that “[the\nvictims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an extensive amount of “victim management,”\nas the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”\n338 OPR located FBI interview reports relating to only one February l, 2oo8 victim interview. Although\nVillafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, OPR\nlocated no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.
