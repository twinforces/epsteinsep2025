Judge Berman:\n\nAs a suffering victim of Epstein and his co-conspirators, I would like to highlight some\nthings that stand out to me and for many reasons on the latest ‘memo’ writen by an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>\nmember of the DOJ.\n\nOne, I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or\ncombating child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way. If there was justice for the victims\nwe would see some kind of accountability for the years they alloued this horrible human being,\nif you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls while jet-seting around the world\nwith high-profile individuals and/or entrapping his victims in his various mansions and/or his\nnotorious private island. And to make maters more severe continued to traffic, rape and assault\nvictims while on prison work-release and/or even after being a registered sex offender for about a\ndecade. Rather, I feel like the DOJ’s and FBI’s priority is protecting the “third-party”, the\nwealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files of which the victims, “knou who\nthey are”. To learn that our oun president has utilized thousands of agents to protect his identity\nand these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blouing. That is their focus? Wou!\n\nTwo, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison leaves us all empty, without answers,\nwithout resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that will never die. I ask myself every day, what\nhappened? Did he really “Kill himself’? Is he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get\nto see his dead body? This all leaves me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.\n\nThree, the latest atention on the “Epstein Files”, the “Client List” is OUT OF CONTROL\nand the ones that are left to suffer are not the high-profile individuals, IT IS THE VICTIMS.\n\nWhy the lack of concern in handling such sensitive information for the victims sake?\n\nI appreciate your time reading my short thoughts and feeling and my anxiety and\nfrustration is NOT aimed at you, obviously. It is aimed at the very government here, the ones\nasking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they\nhave concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them,\nbut them. I am beside myself.\n\nI think what I would request from you, your honor, is to consider having an approved\nthird-party review these documents to ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed\nthrough this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are\ncompletely and entirely protected.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo757", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000759.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 69 Filed o8/o4/25 Pagelof2\nMEMO ENDORSED August 4, 2o25 Page l\nDocket and file. e\nVIA EMAIL TO JUDGE BERMAN:\nHon.

Judge Berman:\n\nI come forward to you today in disdain, disgust and fear of hou the United States of\nAmerica’s DOJ has handled the promise to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very difficult time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”.

Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong\nbecause “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell).\n\nOf course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v.\nGiampino, 68o F.2d 898, 9ol n. 3 (2d. Cir. l982). Every circuit with\npublished patern instructions inform juries that they are not to\nconsider the indictment as evidence.

Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses.

As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

The Defendant’s Suppression Motion Should Be Denied\n\nMaxwell seeks suppression of the evidence the Government obtained via a judicially\nauthorized subpoena to Boies Schiller under Martindell, the Fourth Amendment, Fifth\nAmendment, the Due Process clause, and the Court’s inherent authority. Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion turns on erroneous facts, runs afoul of controlling law, and should be denied.\n\nl. Martindell Provides No Basis to Grant the Relief the Defendant Seeks\n\nMaxwell argues that the Government “circumvented” the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and “violated Maxwell’s rights,” which requires suppression of the evidence the\nGovernment obtained from the subpoena. (Def. Mot. ll at ll-l2). Even assuming that to be\ntrue—which, of course, as detailed above and herein, it is not—there is no basis in law to suppress\nevidence as a result of a Martindell violation, and Maxwell cites none in support of her claim.\nSeting that fatal flaw aside, houever, her claim is wrong on both the facts and the law. The\nGovernment issued a valid grand jury subpoena for the materials, applied for judicial authorization\nto modify the protective order to permit compliance with the subpoena, and a district court judge,\nwho evaluated the Government’s application under Martindell, properly exercised her discretion\nin modifying the protective order. Only after receiving that court order did the Government obtain\nany protected materials from Boies Schiller. Maxwell’s motion should be denied.\n\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]here is no question that a Rule 26(c) protective order is subject to modification,” and\n\na decision to modify such an order is “commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” Jn re\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 239\ncourt modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in\nreasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to knou\nwhat was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation\nof Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. ll at l). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and\nmeritless.\n\nFirst, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies\nSchiller. As an initial mater, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>\nsources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes\nand correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller\nplayed no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That\ninvestigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last knoun contact between any\nlawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on\nEpstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation\nin late November 2ol8 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.\nAUSA-l was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting\nthat had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).\n°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-l to open an investigation of\nEpstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside\nfrom the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-l did meet with the three\natorneys in February 2ol6, she understood the atorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on\nEpstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at l, 4). The presentation to AUSA-l focused on urging\nan investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was\nto investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.\n\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.

Either (l) Giuffre’s atorneys knew in February\n2ol6 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with\nAUSA [at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA\nand Giuffre’s atorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed.\nEither way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2ol6, and the\nResponse’s insistence otherwise is not credible.\n\ne Defense 3: Maxwell’s argument relies on nothing but the Daily News\n\narticle.\n\nThe government says that Maxwell’s argument “is premised solely on her use of selective\nsnippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>\nsources and hearsay.” Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its oun\nterms.\n\nWhen Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government’s emails and\nAUSA [J Contemporancous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (l963). The government did not disclose these materials until\nMaxwell challenged the government’s candor and conduct before Judge McMahon.

The Court Should Grant a Bill of Particulars.\n\nA bill of particulars is appropriate if the indictment does not disclose to the defendant\nwith sufficient particularity “the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling\ndefendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy\nshould he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v.

Here, the revelation of new allegations from Accuser-3 disclosed\nfor the first time in the government’s opposition, as well as the government’s continuing refusal\nto identify the names of the three accusers, justify the need for a bill of particulars to prevent\nunfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nFirst, as it has done since the beginning of this case, the government continues to deny\nMs. Maxwell the most basic piece of information she needs to investigate the allegations against\nher and prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused her of the crimes\ncharged in the Indictment. Rather than atempt to justify withholding this information out of\nconcer for the accusers’ safety or privacy—an untenable argument, given that two of the three\naccusers, if we are correct about their identities, have already publicly identified themselves—the\ngovernment instead argues that because it has provided enough information for Ms. Maxwell to\nguess who they are, there is no need to disclose their names at this point. (Opp. l8l-82). Ms.\nMaxwell should not have to rely on guesswork to prepare for trial, especially when the testimony\nof these three accusers will comprise the core of the government’s proof. With trial only four\nmonths away, Ms. Maxwell’s need to have sufficient time to investigate the allegations against\nher vastly outweighs any countervailing interest the accusers may have in remaining <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>.\nIf the government is unwilling to provide the names of the accusers, the Court should order the\ngovernment to do so either as part of a bill of particulars or pursuant to its inherent authority to\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4233", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Not one of the witnesses contacted during the investigation\nidentified Ms. Maxwell as a person who recruited them, had contact with them, or instructed\nthem to do anything with Epstein.\n\nThe reports from the Palm Beach Police Department reflect that Officer\nreceived an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> complaint about an unidentified male on March l4, 2oo5. Officer Jy\nbegan an investigation that, six months later, was turned over to officer Joseph Recarey. Officer\nBEE investigative efforts centered on an alleged victim J. according to the police\nreports, was contacted at her school as a result of a concern by her stepmother. When questioned\nat the school, J denied any sexual contact with any adult male. Later she acknouledged\nhaving sexual contact with Epstein and also told the police that she told Epstein that she was l8\nyears old. She indicated that she met Epstein through an individual named Jgggand also\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nFinally, in Martha Stewart, the defendant brought a post-trial motion alleging a host of\ndeliberate omissions by a juror. 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438. Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s\nfactual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at\n3o5 & n.7. And although the Second Circuit stated in dicta that it might have held a hearing in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page6of2l\nBaker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d\nl2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)). Mere “[g]ossip and <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> tips do not satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4). Rather, “[a]llegations of\nimpropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and\nrelevant evidence.’” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o,\n543 (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard. Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2o22, at 8\nn.4. But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard. And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9547", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o. And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 5o’s description of his social\nmedia accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” /d. The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagellof2l\n\nFirst, the news article upon which the Defendant relies does not warrant a hearing.\nBaker, 899 F.3d at l3o. The article includes a short, non-detailed mention of an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>\njuror. As the Second Circuit recently held in affirming the denial of a hearing after a high-profile\ntrial, “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made to a magazine\nreporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence’” of\nmisconduct that requires a hearing. United States v. Guzman Loera, 24 F 4th l44, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o22) (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). Another court in this circuit held that a New York\nTimes article that, in a single sentence, alleged misconduct by an unidentified juror was\ninsufficient to justify a hearing. United States v. Bin Laden, No. STR 98-CR-lo23 (KTD), 2oo5\nWL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub nom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S.\nEmbassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (“This single sentence, an unsworn snippet of\nhearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn affidavits present in\ncases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.”).\n\nOther courts have also concluded that unsworn, hearsay, and/or <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> reports of\njuror misconduct are not the clear, strong, and nonspeculative evidence required for a hearing.\nSee, e.g., King v. United States, 576 F.2d 432, 438 (2d Cir. l978) (affirming the denial of a\nhearing where the defendant presented “weakly authenticated, vague, and speculative material as\nto one juror,” even where that juror was not <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>); United States v. Wilbern, 484 F. Supp.\n3d 79, 87 (W.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (finding a “double hearsay” report of misconduct inadequate to\njustify a hearing); Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438 (denying the defendant’s request for an\nevidentiary hearing where the defendant’s support, including post-trial media interviews,\n‘“amount[s] to litle more than hearsay, speculation, and in one instance, vague allegations made\nby a person who refused to identify himself”). Accordingly, the New York Times article is an\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a difficult legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nFinally, in Martha Stewart, the defendant brought a post-trial motion alleging a host of\ndeliberate omissions by a juror. 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438. Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s\nfactual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at\n3o5 & n.7. And although the Second Circuit stated in dicta that it might have held a hearing in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9839", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 42 of 49\nfirst instance, it held that the district court’s decision not to do so was within its broad discretion.\nId. at 3o6.\n\nAs the foregoing cases reflect, given the dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’\nconduct, to warrant a hearing, allegations of impropriety must be “concrete allegations of\ninappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant evidence.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o\n(quotation omited). A single, <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> sentence found in a newspaper article does not meet\nthat standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from the risks inherent on relying on\nsuch information. See Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., l89 F.3d 2l8, 232 (2d Cir. l999) (describing\nthe “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (l) insincerity, (2) faulty\nperception, (3) faulty memory and (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and\nnumerous others, courts have routinely declined to grant evidentiary hearings based solely on\nhearsay statements. See also, e.g., United States v. Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5),\naff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9); Daniels v. Hollins, No. CV-\no2-4495FBLB, 2oo6 WL 474l2, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2oo6); United States v. Menendez, 44o F.\nApp’x 9o6, 9ll-l2 (llth Cir. 2oll). As one court observed, “to permit an inquiry based on such\nscant evidence in a case that continues to receive an unprecedented level of publicity would do\nserious damage to the policies that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Stewart, 3l7\nF. Supp. 2d at 443. So too here.\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s request to expand the hearing to call every juror\nmerely to inquire into a single <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span> statement in a newspaper article.\n\n4. The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied\n\nThe Court should deny the defendant’s motion for “pre-hearing discovery” in its entirety.\n\nGiven the “evil consequences” of post-verdict juror inquiries, courts may not permit such inquiries\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\ntrial ended. There is no question that Juror 5o would have knoun (if he didn’t knou before) that\nthat Maxwell trial was all over the press and was the subject of a massive media blitz. Far from\nhoping to remain <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>, Juror 5o reveled in the atention and started posting his oun\nmessages on social media, using his actual picture and his real first name, announcing to the\nworld that he was on the Maxwell jury. (See Motion at 2o, Juror 5o’s Instagram Account) (“I\ncan nou tell everyone that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.”). Juror 5o was not\nlooking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his l5 minutes of fame. This, again, is\nstrong evidence of Juror 5o’s bias.\n\nWhether Juror 5o’s false responses were for the purpose of securing a spot on the jury or\nbecause he was deluding himself about his ability to be impartial, Juror 5o’s multiple false\nstatements on the questionnaire and to the Court add to the bases for finding that he should have\nbeen struck for cause. See Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (“Even when prospective jurors are\ndishonest for reasons other than a desire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir\ndire questions indicate that a juror is unwilling or unable to apply the law as instructed by the\ncourt to the evidence presented by the parties and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of\nimpartiality[.]” (internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nFinally, Juror 5o admited that he was perfectly willing to disregard the Court\ninstructions. In light of his statements that he “flew through” the questionnaire, the Court asked\nJuror 5o whether he was concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions. (Tr. l8). Juror 5o\nresponded, “Absolutely not.” (/d.). When the Court asked him again, he again responded “No, I\nreally ... this is a terrible excuse, but I didn’t really think I would be chosen.” (/d.). A\nwillingness to disregard the Court’s instructions shous an inability to serve as an unbiased juror\nand raises independent grounds for a for cause challenge. See Dyer v.

These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\nprecluded from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l2 of l4\nA lawyer may also consider whether the prospective harm to the victim or victims is\nimminent in deciding whether to disclose the information protected by section 6o68,\nsubdivision (e)(l).

If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do\nboth. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\ndisclosure of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present.

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress.

Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us.

See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5).

As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>.

This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics.

Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a long time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need.

At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033229.tif": "gifts to be <span class=\"highlight\">anonymous</span>. Where this is not possible, he nonetheless does not seek the .\nspotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.\nJeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the\nInstitute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe\nhaven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such\nplaces as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors\nover the last several years of the “Female Economist of the Year” award offered by the\nStockholm School of Economics. Jeffrey and one of the foundations he has created were\nthe original sponsors and creators of “The Prize for Promise,” a national award program\ndesigned to “identify post-graduate women of exceptional ability, ambition, brilliance,\ncourage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of\nendeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s\ngenerosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former\nPresident Clinton. Jeffrey approached the President of Rwanda and offered to pay the\n: room, board, and tuition for two worthy Rwandan students to earn an undergraduate\ndegree in the United States. Jeffrey has made good on this promise through the Clinton\n, Foundation, and the two students are currently enrolled at the City University of New\nYork where they are expected to graduate in 2oo8.\nJeffrey has also been a generous contributor to a number of wellness\norganizations. In particular, he has donated significant sums to the Ovarian Cancer\nResearch Fund, the Alliance for Lupus Research, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the\nContinuum Center for Health & Healing, the Institute for Music and Brain Science, and\nthe Center for Health and Healing.\nJeffrey has also been a Jong time benefactor of a number of civic organizations in\nboth New York City and the Virgin Islands. With respect to the former, he has been a\nmajor contributor to the Robin Hood Foundation, whose purpose is to target poverty in\nNew York City by finding, funding, and partnering with the most effective poverty\n: fighting programs to maximize results. In the Virgin Islands, Jeffrey has donated money\nto literally dozens of civic organizations in need. These have included educational,\n. sports, environmental, governmental, crisis intervention, children’s advocacy and\nwomen’s groups. One noteworthy example is the Antilles School in St. Thomas which\n9\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033235.tif": "address life problems and reach their potential; to enable educational, wellness, and civic ‘\n_ organizations to beter achieve their respective purposes; and, to foster the kind of\nscientific research which might potentially benefit all of mankind.
