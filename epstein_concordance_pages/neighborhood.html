Kate, in what <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> was this tounhouse?\n\nA. In the same <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> I lived in, in Belgravia.\n\nId. at ll77:5-6.\n\nThe l996 Agreement proves that Kate’s testimony is not accurate.\n\nConfronted with proof that Kate did not tell the truth, the government asks this Court to\npreclude Ms. Maxwell from offering the l996 Agreement into evidence on the theory that,\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not disclose the l996 Agreement earlier, the government was not able\nto fully and fairly investigate its case. Gov. Leter at 6. The government’s argument is\ngroundless.!\n\n' It is also tone-deaf, considering the government’s patern and practice of discovering\nevidence in dead of night, just hours before witnesses testify. Some examples:\n\ne The government first disclosed Kate’s driver’s license at ll:ll p.m. the night before\n\nshe testified.\nDOJ-OGR-oooll334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l3, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell did not contravene Rule l6. As a mater of reciprocal discovery, that\nRule requires the defense to disclose an item to the government if “the defendant intends to use\nthe item in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A)(i).\n\nThe relevance of the l996 Agreement was not apparent until after Kate testified, under\noath, to an impossibility—that she visited Kinnerton Street years before Ms. Maxwell bought it.\nThe l996 Agreement is classic evidence of impeachment by contradiction, which, “unlike\naffirmative evidence presented to support her defense, [a defendant] may not even knou she may\nneed to use . . . until after she hears the direct testimony of the witness.” United States v. Hsia,\nNo. CRIM. 98-oo57 (PLF), 2ooo WL l95o67, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 2l, 2ooo).\n\nContrary to the government’s representation, Kate’s FBI 3o2 materials did not shou what\nshe would say on the stand about where Ms. Maxwell’s home was in l994. Gov. Leter at 5. To\nthe contrary, before her trial testimony last week, Kate had told the government two different\nstories. The first was that Ms. Maxwell lived in the Kensington <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of London:\n\n[Kate] thought that there were approximately two assaults by EPSTEIN before she\n\nstarted traveling with he and MAXWELL, but was unsure about the exact number.\n\nThis occurred at MAXWELL’s residence in Kensington.\n\n35l3-oo9 at 3 (FBI 3o2).\n\ne The government first endorsed and disclosed a new witness and new exhibits on\nDecember 9, the night before calling the witness to the stand on the last day of the\ngovernment’s case.\n\ne The government belatedly disclosed expert opinion testimony from Examiner Flatley.\n\ne All the material the government disclosed after November 3o, including leters,\nPayPal record, and bank records.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l3, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nThe second was that she lived on Kinnerton Street in the Belgravia <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of\nLondon. See 35l3-o37 at 3 (FBI 3o2) (Kate saying she lived at an apartment in the Belgravia\n<span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of London); id. at 8 (describing Ms. Maxwell’s Kinnerton home as “across the\nstreet” from a pub “called ‘Nags Head,’” which is in Belgravia).\n\nUntil Kate testified and commited to one of these versions of events, Ms. Maxwell could\nnot have knoun whether the l996 Agreement would be relevant and admissible at trial. After all,\nif Kate had testified that she visited Ms. Maxwell in l994 at Ms. Maxwell’s home in the\nKensington <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of London, the l996 Agreement for the sale of the Kinnerton Street\nhome in the Belgravia <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of London would have been irrelevant. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4ol, 4o2. Because Ms. Maxwell did not intend to use the l996 Agreement as evidence until after\nKate testified, and because Ms. Maxwell disclosed the l996 Agreement to the government as\nsoon as she decided to use the agreement as evidence, there was no violation of Rule l6.\n\nThe government is doubly wrong to imply impropriety by saying that the defense “made\na point of confirming with Kate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on\nKinnerton Street across from the Nags Head Pub—twice.” Gov. Leter at 5 (citing TR l2/6/2o2l,\npp l235, l253-54). It was the government that first elicited testimony from Kate that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly lived at Kinnerton Street in the Belgravia <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span> of London in l994.\nTR l2/6/2o2l, p ll72, ll76-77. The questions Ms. Maxwell asked Kate on cross-examination\nand the evidence Ms. Maxwell nou intends to use are responsive to, and impeachment of, Kate’s\ntestimony offered on direct examination. See TR l2/6/2o2l, p l253:l8-23 (“Q. Nou you’ve\ntestified that you met Ghislaine at her home on Kinnerton Street when you were l7 years old;\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l3, 2o2l\nPage 5\ncorrect? A. I testified that I thought I was around that age, yes. Q. And I think you said, when\nasked to do the math, that it was approximately l994; correct? A. Yes.”)\n\nSecond, the government’s theory of prejudice is bewildering. The government contends\nthat it was prejudiced by its oun failure to investigate whether its witness was telling the truth.”\nGov. Leter at 6. Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span>, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia <span class=\"highlight\">neighborhood</span>. The government chose not to investigate\nwhere Ms. Maxwell actually lived in l994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is\nnot Ms. Maxwell’s fault. And neither is it her duty to do the government’s work for it. The\ngovernment cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did\nnot become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov. Leter at 6.\n\nThe government complains about the difficulty of conducting investigations abroad. Gov.\nLeter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving\nmultiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the\nconclusion of trial.”). The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the\ngovernment had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college\nrecord. There was nothing preventing these investigators from asking the most basic of\nquestions: When did Ms. Maxwell purchase the Kinnerton Street property?\n\n? The government’s failure to investigate is not limited to Kate’s allegations. The veracity\nof another accuser, Jane, is the subject of a post-testimony 35oo disclosure. ay\nee\na —CSsSCSCsCises\na\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 32 of 26l ll72\nLC6Cmaxl Kate — direct\nl A.
