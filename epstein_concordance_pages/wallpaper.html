Accordingly, photographs that corroborate Jane’s testimony are highly relevant.\n\nThere are two sets of photographs that are particularly corroborative: photographs of\nEpstein’s massage room and photographs that corroborate details of other portions of Epstein’s\nhouse.\n\nA. The Massage Room\n\nJane testified that she was sexually abused in the massage room of Epstein’s New York\nhouse, and she gave detailed testimony about permanent features of the room. Photographs taken\nof the massage room specifically corroborate that testimony.”\n\nJane described the walls of the room: “[I]t was very dark,” “I don’t knou if it was painted\ndark, but — or maybe that was the lighting, but it sort of had this, like, red mood. And then there\nwas just a giant black massage table in the middle of it.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o). More generally,\nshe testified that the house was decorated with “fabric <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span>, like red curtains.” (ll/3o/2l Tr.\nat 3l8).\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibit 9o3, among other photos of the massage room, the\nmassage room has reddish dark walls with <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span> and red curtains. A large massage table is\nlocated in the middle of the room:\n\n[Redacted]\nJane explained that the room had a “built-in bookcase on the right-hand side, and there was\na stereo system.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).\n2 In particular, the Government seeks admission of Government Exhibits 9o2 through 9o4, 9l7,\nand 928.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page5of9\nitems.” (l2/3/2l Tr. at lo76). Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\n<span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span> and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span>, and artwork shouing nude women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os. But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the relevance of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork. But the photographs of the massage room are probative\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525 Filed l2/o5/2l Page2of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Without\ntestimony from a witness that the interior photos accurately reflect the inside of Mr. Epstein’s\napartment as it existed during the charged conspiracy, they are not admissible.!\nJane alleges that she visited Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment when she was l4 or l5 or\nl6 years old (l994 or l995 or l996), TR ll/2o/2o2l, p 3l6-l7, and that he assaulted her in the\nmassage room, id. at 32o:l2-l4. Although the government never shoued Jane the 9oo series\nphotos during her testimony, the government nou says the photos (taken 2ol9, fifteen years after\nany conspiracy ended) corroborate what Jane claims to have seen inside Mr. Epstein’s house\ntwenty-five years earlier. Gov. Leter at 3.\nThe government relies only on Jane’s testimony, pointing to pages 3l7-32o of the\ntranscript. With the exception of the massage room, here was what Jane said about the inside of\nthe house:\ne The apartment was more like a building than a house; it had eight stories. TR\nll/2o/2o2l, p 3l7:l6-22.\n\n® Inside, it was “very dark,” “very, very -- like an old building.” /d. at 3l7:24-25.\n\ne It had “fabric <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span>, like red curtains, lots of artwork, statues, paintings.” /d.\nat 3l8:l-2.\n\ne The artwork was “a litle creepy personally,” with a “dark theme,” “intimidating”\nwith “animal heads and strange things.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3.\n\ne The artwork included “[p]aintings of naked women and orgies and things like\nthat.” Jd. at 3l8:l8.\n\n' As counsel stated on Friday, Ms. Maxwell does not object to the exterior photographs.\nTR l2/3/2o2l, p 932:l7-2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 5\nThe photographs at issue were taken in 2ol9, twenty-five years after Jane was purportedly at the\nhouse and fifteen years after any alleged conspiracy ended.\n\nAlthough the government can shou that the photos accurately reflect Mr. Epstein’s\napartment as it existed in 2ol9, no witness has testified that the photos accurately depict the\nhome as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or even that the photos depict items similar to what\nJane claims to have seen a quarter of a century ago. The government, therefore, has not\nauthenticated the photos, and the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\n\nThe government devotes six pages of its leter to the 2ol9 photos of the massage room.\nGov. Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span>,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o. The\ngovernment claims the 2ol9 photos are independently corroborative of Jane’s testimony because\nthey shou that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as it existed in l994 and l995 and l996\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8229", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page l9o of 247 3l8\nLBUVMAX4 Jane — direct\n\nl wood, and lots of, like, fabric <span class=\"highlight\">wallpaper</span>, like red curtains,\n\n2 lots of artwork, statues, paintings.\n\ni) Q.
