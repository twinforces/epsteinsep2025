Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 28 Filed o7/23/2o Pade ANT ’ |\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: : =\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:7/23/2o2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell.

SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance. There cannot be the faintest question of the\n\nconstitutionality of this statute; the courts have again and again\n\nrecognized its validity. Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

The Second Circuit rejected the argument, finding that it “[wa]s\nbased upon an improper premise.” /d. at 24. Contrary to the defendant’s claims, “[w]here a jury\nvenire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there\nhas been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd.

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons.

Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her.

Defense counsel did not respond.\n\nMost recently, on June 3o, 2o2l, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed in the New York Daily\nNews.? The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill Cosby and argued that this case should be\ndismissed in the wake of Mr. Cosby’s release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that “[t]he trial court, just like the trial\ncourt and intermediate appellate court in Cosby’s case, has agreed to let the government out of its\ndeal.” The Op-Ed further claims that this case is “extremely weak” and asserts that “[a] jury should\nreject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s\nappellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.*\n\nB.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America.

THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R.

The\naftermath of this coverage resulted in the resignation of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, former\nU.S. Atorney of the Southern District of Florida, whose office was the subject of an inquiry\nconducted by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (““OPR’’)\nconcerning the federal criminal investigation of Epstein and its interactions with victims.

Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus.

Kyles, 4o F.3d 5l9, 524 (2d Cir. l994) (stating that a\ndistrict court has “broad discretion whether to pose a defendant’s requested voir dire questions”).\nAlthough the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contemplate that district courts may exercise\nthat discretion by permiting counsel to conduct the questioning of potential jurors, see Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 24(a), the usual practice is for the court to conduct its oun questioning, and federal courts\ngenerally have resisted efforts by counsel to expand their oun role. See, e.g., Lawes, 292 F.3d at\nl28 (noting the “long struggle between bench and bar” over juror questioning and observing that\n“federal courts have successfully resisted such atempts” by counsel to have a greater role). Courts\nare generally resistant to such efforts because “[c]ourt and counsel have somewhat different goals\nin voir dire.” Jd. As the Second Circuit has observed:\n\nThe court wants a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury to be chosen and to move\n\nexpeditiously to the presentation of evidence. Counsel want a jury\n\nfavorable to their cause—fair or not—and voir dire aids them in\n\nexercising peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.\n\nCounsel have an additional purpose in voir dire moreover and that\n\ninvolves exposing jurors to various arguments they intend to make\n\nat trial. Counsel view voir dire as an opportunity for advocacy\n\nsimilar to, albeit not the equivalent of, openings or summations.\nId.; see also United States v. Barnes, 6o4 F.2d l2l, l38 (2d Cir. l979) (“[T]he purpose of the voir\ndire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to afford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to\nchoose a jury that fits into some mold that he believes appropriate for his case.” (quotation marks\nand citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant offers no persuasive reason to abandon the customary practice in this\nDistrict,! and of federal courts generally, and to adopt an alternative procedure for this case.

(Dkt. No. 342 at\nl, lo). Even if counsel identify specific or additional issues the defendant believes her atorneys\nshould be able to explore in light of, as the defendant claims, the atorneys’ “more in-depth\nknouledge of the case” (id. at ll), counsel are free to propose additional questions that the Court\nmay ask, and the Court is in the best position to consider whether such inquiry is appropriate and,\nif so, hou to pose such questions in a way that is fair to the interests of all parties and the potential\njurors. Even if counsel atempt to ask their additional questions in an even-handed way, counsel\nmay easily and inadvertently step over the line and significantly prejudice the other side. See\nSaipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l (holding that court-conducted voir dire “assures that the parties\ndo not stray into impermissible areas that could potentially taint the prospective jurors’ answers or\npoint of view [and] permits each party the opportunity to evaluate the questions proposed by their\nadversary”).\n\nThe defendant claims that “questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further\nhampers the ability to uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a\nsubordinate position heightening their reluctance to be candid.” (Dkt.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThere is nothing surprising about the government’s opposition to limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire and individual sequestered voir dire. (Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed questionnaire seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o4 _ Filed ll/o2/2l Page2of6\nDraft Pre-Voir Dire Remarks — November 2, 2o2l\n\nl United States v.

Thank you again for your time and service. As I\n\n6 mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I\n\n7 am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the\n\n8 first step in the jury selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be\n\n9 excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go\nlo through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrou if\nll necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process.\nl2 That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process\nl3. today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you.\nl4 As you knou from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today\nl5 to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As\nl6 you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and\nl7. aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex\nl8 activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking\nl9 ofaminor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent,\n2o and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has\n2l. proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n22) Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal\n23 ~~ case is a critical part of our justice system.

I do not expect that anybody would seek to avoid this\nll important duty for any but the most compelling reasons.\n\nl2 As I mentioned in my prior remarks, the Court has taken a number of steps to help ensure\nl3. the process for selected jurors is as safe and easy as possible. We have masking and distancing\nl4 protocols. We have reconfigured courtrooms to enhance safety measures. The Court will\nl5 provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the courthouse each day.

We’ll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant\nl9 are siting nou. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is\n2o  apublic courtroom. To protect your privacy, I will only refer to you by your juror number.\n2l‘ Please do not state any identifying information.

(See Exhibit A, annexed.)\nThe defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in\nSines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive\nongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 6oo jurors until the day of jury\nselection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury and is a\nprocedure that would violate due process in this particular case.!\n\n“An <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of\ninterest and bias.” United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, ll (2d Cir. 2ol5). In Parse, a case\nbefore Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and\nthree of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86.\nAfter trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground\nthat one of the jurors, Juror No. l (Catherine M. Conrad), “had lied and withheld material\ninformation during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi\nC. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror\nwas examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867\nF.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2ol2) found it “undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire\nand concealed important information about her background” (id. at 45l), her level of education,\nplace of residence, criminal history, and other maters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-9o.\n\n' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a writen juror questionnaire was\nused and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel follouing the completion of\nthe questionnaires.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o5o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006051.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Page3of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

On appeal, the Second Circuit “had no difficulty with the ruling of the district court in\nthe present case that the jury empaneled to hear the case against these defendants was not an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.” /d. at ll. Moreover, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Pauley’s ruling that\nParse had waived his right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, and vacated Parse’s conviction. /d. at ll8.\n\nThe result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 4l witnesses and some l,3oo\nexhibits, was undone by the falsehoods of one juror during voir dire—falsehoods that could have\nbeen uncovered by thorough background research and prompt action by the parties. Numerous\nbar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct internet research on\npotential jurors. Some bar associations have opined that professional standards of competence\nand diligence may require such research. For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted\na post-conviction evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the\nfollouing in Formal Opinion 2ol2-2:\n\nJust as the internet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same\n\ntools have expanded an atorney’s ability to conduct research on potential and siting\n\njurors, and clients nou often expect that atorneys will conduct such research. Indeed,\n\nstandards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably\n\npossible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case.\n\nSimilarly, in 2ol4, the American Bar Association recognized the “strong public interest\nin identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice,” and therefore opined\nthat it was proper for counsel to research “a juror’s or potential juror’s Internet presence, which\nmay include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial... .” See\nStanding Commitee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 466 at l-2, Am.

LEXIS 2l54, at *27 (Super. Ct.\nApp. Div. Aug. 3o, 2olo) (trial judge erred in preventing counsel from using the internet during\njury selection). It is so routine that a party who fails to uncover disqualifying information about\na potential juror, despite a reasonable opportunity to do so, risks waiving the right to use that\ninformation in post-conviction proceedings. Stone at *9o (denying motion to vacate conviction\nand for a new trial because, inter alia, “the defense could have discovered the [foreperson’s\nsocial media] posts as early as September l2, 2ol9, the day counsel received access to the\ncompleted juror questionnaires, including the foreperson’s, which had her name printed legibly\non the signature page.”).\n\nHaving additional time to conduct background research on each of the venirepersons is\nthe best way to ensure a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Balancing the need to protect juror privacy\nagainst Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury weighs in favor of releasing the names of\npotential jurors to counsel upon the completion of their writen questionnaires, not at voir dire.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v.

I'm happy to do that\nl3 nou or at another point if the Court would like.\n\nl4 THE COURT: Do these proposals relate to the\nl5 government's motion that was just filed but not fully briefed,\nl6 or are those separate concerns?\nl7 MS. POMERANTZ: It relates to the government's motion\nl8 regarding privacy and dignity of certain minor victims in this\nl9 case, specifically relating to the request that victims and\n2o witnesses, certain victims and witnesses testify under\nal pseudonyms or their first names only.\n22 THE COURT: Right. I think I have to get briefing on\n23 that motion. Needless to say I'm not prepared to rule on that\n24 yet, so to the extent that the proposals you want to suggest\n25 had a resolution of that motion, I think we need to wait.

STERNHEIM: OK. The documents, all four of\n\n3 them -- the two questionnaires, the parties' and the Court's,\n\n4 as well as the voir dire questions -- contain references to\n\n5 this case, names of participants. Any person who is summoned\n\n6 for jury service, they likely connect their summons with any\n\n7 press coverage there may be with regards to the questionnaire\n\n8 and the jury voir dire questions and this case.\n\n9 Until the prospective jurors complete their\n\nlo questionnaires, they may read coverage, search the media. They\nll are under no obligation or requirement to refrain from that,\n\nl2 and we're concerned that that will further have a diluting\n\nl3 effect on our ability to seat a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. We\n\nl4 have no problem whatsoever at the moment the jury is sworn,\n\nl5 after peremptories have been exercised, that the Court place on\nl6 the public record all of those documents. This is a procedure\nl7 that we think can ensure a fair trial for both parties in light\nl8 of extraordinary media coverage in this case.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I need more specifics. You said\n2o references to this case, names of participants. The docket nou\n2l and going forward, as more filings come in, is going to contain\n22 names related to this case, names of participants.

I do not think that\n\n9 there is a great hardship or denial of the public's right to\n\nlo knou when the Court has just said that the press can be present\nll during the questioning, and that would be the day of the jurors\nl2 actually being in court. But I think to place the\n\nl3 questionnaire and the voir dire questions on the public record\nl4 and have them reported in the press, a situation that the Court\nl5 cannot control, will have a very negative effect on both the\n\nl6 parties in this case, but most significantly on the party that\nl7 has been most damaged, that being Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl8 THE COURT: OK. Any authorities, any specific\n\nl9 authorities, and I mean examples of any other -- there are lots\n2o of significant high-profile cases that have occurred in this\n2l district and others. Any examples, and I don't presume any\n22 judge in such a case could control press coverage.

Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving controlled substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Pagelof9\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP i ORE Ypres\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

We are deeply concerned about the effect that a negative answer to this\nquestion would have, not only for the rights of the defendant in this case, but upon future\ndefendants, jurors and courts.\n\n4. NACDL is made up of members who routinely try criminal cases in federal and\nstate courts throughout the United States. We knou from our experiences that the effectiveness\nof the voir dire process in eliciting truthful answers to questions designed to weed out biased or\notherwise unqualified jurors is a fundamental structural prerequisite for ensuring our clients,\noften the most vulnerable and scorned members of society, receive a fair trial. NACDL members\nhave conducted numerous voir dire examinations, including in many high-profile or sensitive\ncriminal cases.\n\n5. With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009036.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 66\n2d at 468 (quoting Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 983 (9th Cir.l998) (en banc)).\n“TC]ourts cannot administer justice in circumstances in which a juror can commit a\nfederal crime in order to serve as a juror in a criminal case and do so with no fear of\nsanction so long as a conviction results.” United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l52\n(2d Cir. l989),\n\nArgument\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D. Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 66\nmaterial if it has a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the judge\nwho must decide whether to excuse a juror for cause.” (citing Neder v.

Had Juror No. 5o answered Questions 25 and 48 truthfully, his answers\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\n\nThe second question is whether truthful responses from Juror No. 5o would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. “[T]he test\nis not whether the true facts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but\nrather whether a truthful response ‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 47o (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\n“An <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is one in which every juror ls ‘capable and willing to decide the\ncase solely on the evidence before [him].’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 554).\n“Jurors are instructed that they are to decide the question of a defendant’s guilt based\nsolely on the evidence presented.” /d. (citing United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l6-\nl7 n.lo (2d Cir. l997).

Supp. 2d at l62—67 (discussing at\nlength each type of bias).\n\nl. Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the\napplicable analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised\nits discretion in finding the juror “was not <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.” l96 A.3d at 97.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 66\n2. Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 48 of 66\na\na\na\na\nRee x. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”).

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009054.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 53 of 66\nE. Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3 ll\nWg. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 57 of 66\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that any hearing begin with the questioning of Juror No. 5o.\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court first advise Juror No. 5o about the nature of the\nhearing and then allou defense counsel to question Juror No. 5o folloued by questioning\nfrom the government, re-cross examination by defense counsel, folloued by any\nquestions from the Court and any additional questions from counsel based on the Court’s\nquestions.\n\nIf, after this examination further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the\nsecond juror be summoned to Court for an identical process. If necessary, this process\nshould be repeated as to all remaining jurors.\n\nAfter the examination of the jurors the parties should be afforded a period of time\nto conduct any further investigation warranted by the information presented at the hearing\nfolloued by post-hearing arguments, either oral or writen.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b) does not prohibit this inquiry, because Ms.\nMaxwell does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the content of deliberations.

Evid. 6o6(b) (providing that, with certain exceptions, “a juror may not testify\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations”\nduring ‘“‘an inquiry into the validity of a verdict”). Instead, she intends to shou that her\njury was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> as required by the Sixth Amendment because at least two\njurors gave false answers during voir dire to material questions that, if answered\ntruthfully, would have subject them to a challenge for cause.\n\nTo the extent Rule 6o6 might apply to certain questions asked at the hearing, Ms.\nMaxwell need not inquire into the content of deliberations to establish her jury bias\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o58", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 62 of 66\nrender that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We think that\nthe item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.”’). Moreover, if\nstricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike such\nmaterial from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the\nperformance of the judicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document”\nand would enjoy no presumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the\npublic has a right of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that\n“Tb]efore any such common law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude\nthat the documents at issue are indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9.\n“Once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and that\ntherefore a common law presumption of access ataches, it must determine the weight of\nthat presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the weight of the presumption of\naccess, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against it.’” Jd. at l2o.\n\nThere exists no compelling reason to release Juror No. 5o’s pleadings. Any public\nrelease of the documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and\ncommentary, all of which ls prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s\nrights to fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> proceedings.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 63 of 66\n\nThe submissions by Juror No. 5o have questionable merit, have not been ruled\nupon, and implicate an ongoing investigation by the parties and the Court into juror\nmisconduct.

We knou from the experiences of our members that\nchild sexual abuse cases are “the most difficult of all” for eliminating juror bias and we thus hold\nregular training programs concerning voir dire strategies in such cases. NACDL, What Are They\nThinking?, htps://www.nacdl.org/Event/2o22-Midwinter-Meeting (program description). Even\nprosecutors agree that “[t]raditional voir dire questions... might not sufficiently address potential\njurors’ emotional reactions to sexual assault cases,” and advocate more probative voir dire.\nChristopher Mallios & Toolsi Meisner, Educating Juries In Sexual Assault Cases, Strategies at 2\n(2olo), htp://www.ncdsv.org/images/AEquitas EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPartl_7-\n2olo.pdf. The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> ina sexual abuse case. The parties and the Court relied on the accuracy of his\nanswers in allouing him to sit on the jury. Nou that he has exposed his real experiences and\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page3ofl2\nviews, it is clear he was biased and unfit to serve. If he made his false statements intentionally to\nget on the jury, that would mean he had a personal agenda and his bias was even more apparent,\nbut even false statements in the absence of lying would justify striking him for cause. Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v. Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN <span class=\"highlight\">IMPARTIAL</span> JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.

In the past, coupling voir dire with prospective jurors swearing an oath to tell\nthe truth was a pouerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once\ndid. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation\n\non the part of a witness was borroued from the British common law, the swearing of an\n\noath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would\n\ntell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be\n\nsubject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the\n\nwitness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed doun by God to\n\nMoses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 2o,\n\nVerse l6 (King James Version)). Unfortunately, the sanctity of the oath taken by\n\nwitnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laced with skepticism in recent years.\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 74o F.

Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43-48 (2d Cir. l997). Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol.

Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses. His oun experience, in his oun mind, left him predisposed to reject\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page4of49\ndiscovery and an expansive hearing—requests that present exactly the sort of “evil consequences”\nof which the Second Circuit has warned: “subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom\ndeliberation, burdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury\ntampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009125.jpg": "of being a victim of a crime.

Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.

Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial.

Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page9of49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the questionnaire that might make it difficult for him to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 24 of 49\nthat must be folloued,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are\nselected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at\nthe trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any\nother ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your\nverdict?” Id. at 43-44.\n\nWith respect to Juror 5o, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of\nactual bias. In a public interview, Juror 5o stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that\nMaxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that\nhis oun experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until\nproven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with\nwhich the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous\nquestions submited over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split\nverdict, in which it acquited the defendant on one count. See United States v. Aiello, 77l F.2d\n62l, 63l (2d Cir. l985) (citing apparent care with which jury approached deliberations and split\nverdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at l74 (citing split verdict as evidence of\nimpartiality). And Juror 5o’s public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir\ndire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follou the law as instructed\nby the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence,\npresented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he\ncould not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nWhile the defendant has not argued for a finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at 38-39), she\nat times alludes to the argument. For example, the defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o\ncalled the defendant a “predator,” said the verdict was for “all the victims,” and commented on a\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 25 of 49\nTwiter post by Annie Farmer. (Def. Mem. at l3, l5-l6). But he did these things after trial, having\nheard all the evidence that proved that, as the Government argued, the defendant was in fact a\npredator and that the victims, including Farmer, were credible. Juror 5o’s atitudes touards the\ndefendant and the victims after he heard compelling evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the\nvictims’ credible testimony says nothing about the relevant inquiry here: whether he was biased\n“before he heard the evidence presented.” United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 44o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 439\nn.4 (finding no bias where juror in Martha Stewart trial said the verdict was “a victory for the litle\nguy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant “thought she was above everything’’).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant gestures at an actual bias argument when she states that it is\n“clear,” based on Juror 5o’s statements to the media,!? that he was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> “because\nhis personal experiences ‘prevent[ed] or substantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as\na juror.’” (Def. Mem. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit, 469 U.S. 4l2, 424 (l985))). There and\nelsewhere, the defendant’s brief seems to suggest that jurors are required to check their lived\nexperiences at the jury room door. Not so:\n\nWe cannot expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions\n\nof jurors, their additudinal expositions, or their philosophies. These\n\ninvolve the very human elements that constitute one of the strengths\n\nof our jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate\n\nthem from jury deliberations.\nU.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o); see also United States v. Bangiyev,\nNo. o7 Cr. 33l (NG) (RLM), 2oo8 WL 424ooo5, at *lo (E.D.N.Y. Sept. l2, 2oo8) (explaining\n‘8 As noted above, many if not all of the statements upon which the defendant relies describe\ndeliberations and are thus inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). And even if they were not, Juror 5o’s\npublic statements about deliberations in fact demonstrate that he (and the jury more generally) was\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See infra n.5.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 37 of 49\n\nThe defendant also argues that the Court and the parties would have “probed” Juror 5o\nabout whether he was able to “set aside his oun traumatic experience” when evaluating whether\nthe Government met its burden of proof. (Def. Mem. at 44). Juror 5o confirmed both in writing\nand during oral voir dire that he could “[a]bsolutely” “decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, [] presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l6; see id. at\nl3l:l-7 (stating that he had “[n]o doubt” that he “could decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court’); see also Def. Ex. l, Questions l3 & 4l.\nThere is no need for any further inquiry on this subject, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o\nwas truthful when he stated that he could decide the case based on the facts and evidence presented\nin court.\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the Court and the parties would have specifically inquired\nas to whether Juror 5o was able to fairly evaluate Dr. Loftus’s testimony and impartially assess the\ndefendant’s “defense that her accusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and\nmanipulation.” (Def. Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate prospective jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if prospective jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2l, 2ol8); see also United States v. Barnes, 6o4 F.2d l2l, l38 (2d Cir. l979)\n(“[T]he purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to afford individual analysis\nin depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that he believes appropriate for\nhis case.” (quotation marks and citation omited)). Accordingly, it is clear that the Court would\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l56", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror questionnaire. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise. (Def.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l57", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009189.jpg": "l/26/22, 8:52PM Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-Bebie GhidaineMEReN Ubi inifally dbubed doaiberd /Acdr sayPaGaers Of 4\nDuring jury selection, hundreds of prospective jurors were given questionnaires asking, among\nother things, if they or anyone in their families had experienced sexual abuse, court records\nshou.\n\nFor those who answered yes, the judge in the case asked during follou-up questioning if it would\naffect their ability to serve as a fair or <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror, the records shou.\n\nScoty David said he did not recall being asked about his experience during follou-up\nquestioning, knoun as voir dire.

Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966). That did not happen.

V, VI.! “[T]he seating of any juror who\nshould have been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” United States v. Martinez-Salazar,\n528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6 (2ooo).\n\nThe government’s response to this suffers from two fundamental errors. The first is to\ninsist that a new trial is required only if Juror No. 5o was “dishonest” by “deliberately” providing\nfalse answers to Questions 25 and 48. That is not the law. Neither the United States Supreme\nCourt nor the Second Circuit requires a shouing of a “deliberate falsehood.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (applying McDonough Pouer Equip. v.

We knou at least one other juror in addition to\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having been a victim of sexual abuse or assault.\n\nAlthough this Court need not hold a hearing since the record already establishes that Ms.\nMaxwell was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to trial by an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, any such\nhearing must also serve to identify this other juror. Such a hearing likely would also shou that\nJuror No. 5o was actually biased, in addition to being impliedly and inferably biased.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l96", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009197.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page 7 of 32\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause”). That’s because, as the\nSupreme Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, “the seating of any juror who should\nhave been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 3l6. Thus, irrespective of\nwhether Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 and 48 (though the\nrecord shous he did), his presence on the jury requires reversal if he was impliedly, inferably, or\nactually biased.\n\nSecond, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during any evidentiary hearing.\nOurs is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the constitutional right at issue. Ms. Maxwell was on trial for\nher life. That trial required l2 fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jurors. While paying lip service to the\nrequirement of a fair trial, the government incants the words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l97", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly understood and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit. For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nOO eeeSC——\nee\nee\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case.

The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l4 of 32\nin a “documentary.” Inquiring into the false answers Juror No. 5o has publicly admited making\nrisks nothing that Juror No. 5o hasn’t already brought on himself.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s motion has nothing to do with her innocence or guilt. It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict. Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 5l, 65-66\n(2oll) (“Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek justice, not merely to convict.”).\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\nanswers were deliberately false.\n\nThe government insists that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial only if she can prove\nthat Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers during voir dire. Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v. Green, 49 F.3d ll8l, ll86 n.7\n(6th Cir. l995); accord Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 98l (9th Cir. l998) (en banc) (“In\nextraordinary cases, courts may presume bias based on the circumstances.”); Amirault v.

Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l6 (2d Cir. l994) (noting that under the\nsecond prong of McDonough. a defendant must have a basis for arguing that the district court is\nrequired to sustain his challenge for cause)). As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalc i rs\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘Cis\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C‘(‘CC\nOO —CSCSCSC‘CSCies\nRn (Ss part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 32\n\nFor all the reasons given in the motion, Rule of Evidence 6o6(b) poses no bar to the\ninquiry this Court should conduct on Ms. Maxwell’s motion, primarily because Ms. Maxwell\npossesses evidence from external to the deliberations to substantiate Juror No. 5o’s bias. To the\nextent the Rule might apply as a bar to limit certain questions, it violates Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her. U.S. Const. amends.\nV, VI; cf, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, l37 S. Ct. 855 (2ol7) (finding the no-impeachment rule\nof 6o6(b) unconstitutional as applied to juror statements indicating racial bias). The Rules of\nEvidence cannot constitutionally prevent Ms. Maxwell from proving juror misconduct and\nvindicating her right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.'!\n\n3. The Additional Biased Juror Should Be Questioned\n\nAs detailed in the motion at 2l, a second juror has alerted the New York Times that they\ntoo had deliberated on the case and were the victim of childhood sexual abuse. That juror whose\nidentity is currently unknoun also failed to disclose their victimhood in response to Question\n48.'° The government would like to bury its head in the sand and deprive Ms. Maxwell of the\n\n'! See also Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 & n.3 (holding, before Pena-Rodriguez\nwas decided, that Rule 6o6(b) bars inquiry to “deliberations evidence” when seeking a new trial\nbased on juror false statements during voir dire but recognizing that “[t]here may be cases of\njuror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and\nwhen such a case arises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not\nsufficient to protect the integrity of the process. We need not consider the question, houever, for\nthose facts are not presented here.”’).\n\nWarger doesn’t control here, though, if only because it was a civil and not a criminal\ncase. Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

We were so focused on establishing that this was the same\n5 person. And on the waiver issue I was very focused on the\n6 reality, which is that we didn't knou.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Similarly, it serves no purpose to ask Juror 5o, after the\nfact, whether his experience with childhood sexual abuse affected his ability to be a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror during the deliberations.

Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo.

Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. Nevertheless, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his intention to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror.

Juror No. 5o did not truthfully respond to perhaps the\nmost important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences — a\nquestion that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell: Whether\nthey had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse. Juror No. 5o’s false answer\nundermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, and deprived Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.\n\nThis Court should vacate the judgment and order a new trial.\n\nFactual Background\nI. Jury Selection\nA. The jury questionnaire\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page questionnaire containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe questionnaire’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 66\n\nThe questionnaire began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and\ntransportation.\n\nGiven the accusations and the sensitivity of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment, and the pouerful effects such assault, abuse, and harassment can have, the\nquestionnaire included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had\never been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and hou that might affect their ability to be an\nunbiased fact finder.\n\nFor example, Question No. l3 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case\npurely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or\nprejudices.\n\nQuestion 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,\nwhether that experience would prevent them from being fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nQuestions 42-5o asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types\nof alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual\nharassment.\n\nQuestion 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell\n“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Question 43 asked\npotential jurors if they had views about the laws concerning the age of consent and if\nthose views would affect their ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Question 44 asked potential\njurors if they had views about the laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against\nminors and if those views would affect their ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Question 47\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo97o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 66\n\nIf a potential juror selected either “yes” option, the questionnaire asked individuals\nto explain their answer in writing, to state whether having been a victim of sexual assault,\nsexual abuse, or sexual harassment would affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially, and if so, to explain why.\n\nFinally, Question 5o asked potential jurors if there was any experience that they\nhad that might affect their ability to serve fairly and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> as a juror.\n\nSix-hundred and ninety-four individuals answered the questionnaire.\n\nB. Juror No. 5o’s questionnaire\n\nJuror No. 5o’s questionnaire is atached as EXHIBIT l. Under the penalty of\nperjury, Juror. No. 5o answered these questions as follous:\n\ne Question l3: “Yes,” Juror No. 5o could decide the case solely based on the\nevidence or lack of evidence and not based on bias, sympathy, or prejudice.\n\ne Question 25: “No,” Juror No. 5o had never been the victim of a crime.\n\ne Question 42: “No,” there was nothing about the nature of the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell that “might make it difficult” for Juror No. 5o to be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\ne Question 43: “No,” Juror No. 5o did not have any views about laws\nconcerning the age of consent that would affect his ability to be fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\ne Question 44: “No,” Juror No. 5o did not have any views about the laws\ngoverning sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would affect\nhis ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo97o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 66\n\ne Question 47, “No,” Juror No. 5o would not have any difficulty assessing\nthe credibility of alleged victims of sexual assault or abuse just as he would\nassess the credibility of any other witness.\n\ne Finally, and most importantly, Juror No. 5o answered “no” when asked in\nQuestion 48 if he had ever been the victim of victim of sexual harassment,\nsexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual assault\nor other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance,\nsupervisor, teacher, or family member.\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\n\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved the Court to permit limited, atorney-\nconducted voir dire of potential jurors. Doc. 342. Defense counsel explained that given\nthe nature of the allegations, the stakes involved, and the omnipresent media coverage,\natorney-conducted voir dire to supplement the Court’s voir dire was necessary to ensure\na fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. /d. at 7-l5. Defense counsel pointed specifically to the potential\nthat certain jurors could not be fair if they had been a victim of sexual assault or sexual\nabuse. /d. at 9-lo. The Court declined to permit atorney-conducted voir dire. TR\nlo/2l/2o2l, p 8.\n\nPrior to trial, defense counsel also proposed that the Court individually ask each\njuror in person several questions including \"Have you or anyone close to you ever been\nthe victim of a crime?\" and \"Have you or has anyone close to you ever been the victim of\na sexual crime?\" Doc. 367-l at l4. The government objected that the questions were\n\"duplicative of questions included in the proposed voir dire\" and should not be asked\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l4 of 66\nagain. /d. at l3. The defense responded in part that \"asking the questions live when the\njurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by\nthe parties will aid in the selection of an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and fair jury.\" Jd. The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\nharassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 66\n\nIt also appears that Juror No. 5o did not delete his Instagram account, despite what\nhe told the Court, since he posted about his jury service after the verdict was returned.\n\nAt the end of the very brief voir dire examination, the Court asked Juror No. 5o if\nhe had “[a]ny doubt about [his] ability to” be fair to both sides. /d. at l34. Juror No. 5o\nsaid, “no.” /d. The Court concluded: “Other than what I have asked you, do you have any\nreason to think that you can’t be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> here?” /d. Juror No. 5o responded, “I\ndo not.” Id.\n\nThe Court inquired whether the parties had any follou-up questions. Because\nJuror No. 5o denied any bias or inability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, and because his answers\nto the questionnaire did not raise any red flags about his ability to serve as a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror in a case involving alleged sexual assault and sexual abuse, Ms.\nMaxwell’s atorneys did not propose any follou-up questions.\n\nThe lack of follou-up questions for Juror No. 5o contrasts with other jurors who\nhonestly disclosed their history as victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual\nharassment. F.g., TR ll/l6/2o2l, pp l8-l9, am, 293; TR ll/l7/2o2l, pp\nWM. 436-37, 532, 587-88; TR ll/l8/2o2l, pp 635.\n\nAlso, the lack of follou-up questions put to Juror No. 5o contrasts with Juror No.\n55, whom the Court struck for causc\nee\neC\nSSC\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 28 of 66\nC. A second juror admits to disclosing during deliberations that they were\na victim of sexual assault\nDuring his press tour, Juror No. 5o revealed in interviews that he was not alone in\nrevealing to jurors that he was a victim of sexual assault, describing to reporter that a\nsecond juror also disclosed that they were a victim of sexual abuse.* On January 5, the\nNew York Times published an article confirming Juror No. 5o’s statement, reporting that\n“a second juror described in an interview . . . having been sexually abused as a child.’””\n“This juror, who requested anonymity, said that they, too, had discussed the experience\nduring deliberations and that the revelation had appeared to help shape the jury’s\ndiscussions.” To date, this juror has not publicly revealed their identity, and Ms. Maxwell\ndoes not knou who it is.°\nApplicable Law\nI.

In McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, the Supreme Court recognized that “[o]ne touchstone of a fair trial ls an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trier of fact—‘a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the\nevidence before it.’” 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (quoting Smith v.

United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (reversing district court’s\nconclusion that the defendant Parse waived his new trial motion). It is bedrock\nconstitutional law that defendants have a right to “a full and fair opportunity to expose\nbias or prejudice on the part of veniremen” and that “there must be sufficient information\nelicited on voir dire to permit a defendant to intelligently exercise not only his challenges\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo972l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 66\nfor cause, but also his peremptory challenges.” United States v.

Supp.\n2d at 468; U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n\n“TA] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate\nfirst, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,\n433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\nA defendant need not demonstrate prejudice when a juror gives a false answer to a\nmaterial question during voir dire if the juror would have been subject to a challenge for\ncause if he had answered honestly. See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 3o4,\n3l6 (2ooo) (the “seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause” “would\nrequire reversal”). When a biased juror deliberates on a jury, structural error occurs, and a\nnew trial is required without a shouing of actual prejudice. See Arizona v. Fulminante,\n499 U.S. 279, 3o7-lo (l99l).\n\nB. An intentionally false answer during voir dire is not a prerequisite to\nobtaining a new trial.\n\n“Intentionally false” juror answers are not a prerequisite to a finding that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury have been violated.\nMcDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-56; id. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-59\n(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). So long as a truthful answer would have subjected\nthe juror to a challenge for cause based on bias, an inadvertent false answer is just as\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 33 of 66\nappeals’ statement that the good faith of a potential juror was “irrelevant” to the inquiry.\nId. at 553-56.\n\nThere were two concurring opinions in McDonough, joined by a total of five\njustices, which make clear that an intentionally false answer is not a prerequisite to\nobtaining a new trial. Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 66\n2d at 468 (quoting Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 983 (9th Cir.l998) (en banc)).\n“TC]ourts cannot administer justice in circumstances in which a juror can commit a\nfederal crime in order to serve as a juror in a criminal case and do so with no fear of\nsanction so long as a conviction results.” United States v. Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l52\n(2d Cir. l989),\n\nArgument\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nThis Court must order a new trial if Ms. Maxwell can make two shouings: First,\nthat Juror No. 5o’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3.\nEven without an evidentiary hearing, Ms. Maxwell has made that shouing here.\n\nA. Juror No. 5o did not truthfully answer material questions during voir\ndire, including Questions 25 and 48.\n\nThere is no reasonable dispute that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire responses were false.\nJuror No. 5o has told several media outlets that he was a victim of sexual assault and\nsexual abuse as a child. Necessarily, then, Juror No. 5o did not provide truthful answers\nwhen he denied being the victim of a crime (Question 25) or being a victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault (Question 48).\n\nAnd because being a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse is material to an\nindividual’s ability to serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror in a case about sexual assault and\nsexual abuse, Ms. Maxwell has satisfied the first prong of the McDonough test. See\nUnited States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l72 (D. Mass. 2oll) (“[A] mater is\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9727", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 66\nmaterial if it has a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the judge\nwho must decide whether to excuse a juror for cause.” (citing Neder v. United States, 527\nU.S. l, l6 (l999) (giving general definition of materiality))).\n\nB. Had Juror No. 5o answered Questions 25 and 48 truthfully, his answers\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\n\nThe second question is whether truthful responses from Juror No. 5o would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. “[T]he test\nis not whether the true facts would compel the Court to remove a juror for cause, but\nrather whether a truthful response ‘would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 47o (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).\n\n“An <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is one in which every juror ls ‘capable and willing to decide the\ncase solely on the evidence before [him].’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 554).\n“Jurors are instructed that they are to decide the question of a defendant’s guilt based\nsolely on the evidence presented.” /d. (citing United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l6-\nl7 n.lo (2d Cir. l997).

Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias.

Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary\nhearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the\nconclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nIn State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault based\non the allegation that he touched the genitals of his l2-year-old client during a therapy\nsession. l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8).'? The empaneled jury, houever, included an\nindividual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years\nold. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered\n“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a\nvictim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the\njuror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included\ncommunications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject\nand the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court affirmed.\n\nThe decisions in Sampson and Ashfar support a new trial here. Like those cases,\nJuror No. 5o falsely denied having a personal experience strikingly similar to the conduct\nat issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 5o’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |\n\n'3 Because state courts are more often the venue for prosecution of crimes\ninvolving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New\nHampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the\napplicable analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised\nits discretion in finding the juror “was not <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.” l96 A.3d at 97.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9733", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 66\n2. Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9736", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 66\nor sexual harassment. Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”). The\nquestionnaire also told potential jurors that it would ask personal questions. /d.\n(“Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please\nunderstand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each\njuror’s background and experience to select a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.”’”). A personal\nexperience as a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment is far more\nrelevant to fairness and impartiality than a family member’s or friend’s experience with\nsuch assault, abuse, or harassment. Given the content of the questionnaire and its obvious\npurpose, remembering a question about the later but not the former is simply not\ncredible.\n\nFourth, Juror No. 5o’s post-verdict conduct shous his false answers to the\nquestionnaire were intentional. Juror No. 5o went on a media press to promote himself,\nhis experience as a victim, and his role on the jury. He has given multiple interviews to\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo974o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not\n\njust going to be a summary voir dire; it will be probing. .. . Ifa juror’s going\n\nto lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that out.\n\nTR lo/2l/2o2l, p 25-26. Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun traumatic experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9743", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 53 of 66\nE. Juror 5o’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified\njuror) prevented Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory\nchallenges, denying her a fair trial.\n\nProper voir dire plays a vital role in assuring a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right\nto an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Without an adequate voir dire the trial judge's responsibility to\nremove prospective jurors who may not be able impartially serve cannot be fulfilled.\n“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory\nchallenges where provided by statute or rule, as it is in the federal courts.” Rosales-Lopez\nv. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l88 (l98l) (citation omited).\n\nThe role of peremptory challenges in a criminal trial cannot be overstated:\n\nPeremptory challenges have been an integral aspect of criminal trial\n\nprocedure for over six hundred years and continue to be universally\n\nemployed throughout the country. The underlying thesis is that, with the\nexception of challenges for cause, the suitability of a particular juror is\ncounsel's decision and not the court's. Consistent with that thesis and subject\n\nto constitutional strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on a good reason,\n\na bad reason, or no reason at all.\n\nState v. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263, 65o A.2d lol2, lol9 (App. Div. l994)\n(cleaned up).\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective\njurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell exercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for\ncause or peremptory, would not have knouing alloued a juror who: (l) claimed to be a\nvictim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had been a victim of\nsexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain on the\njury. Had Juror 5o disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used a\nperemptory challenge against this juror and not as to any of the other remaining jurors.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9745", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 57 of 66\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that any hearing begin with the questioning of Juror No. 5o.\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court first advise Juror No. 5o about the nature of the\nhearing and then allou defense counsel to question Juror No. 5o folloued by questioning\nfrom the government, re-cross examination by defense counsel, folloued by any\nquestions from the Court and any additional questions from counsel based on the Court’s\nquestions.\n\nIf, after this examination further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the\nsecond juror be summoned to Court for an identical process. If necessary, this process\nshould be repeated as to all remaining jurors.\n\nAfter the examination of the jurors the parties should be afforded a period of time\nto conduct any further investigation warranted by the information presented at the hearing\nfolloued by post-hearing arguments, either oral or writen.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b) does not prohibit this inquiry, because Ms.\nMaxwell does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the content of deliberations. Cf\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b) (providing that, with certain exceptions, “a juror may not testify\nabout any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations”\nduring ‘“‘an inquiry into the validity of a verdict”). Instead, she intends to shou that her\njury was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> as required by the Sixth Amendment because at least two\njurors gave false answers during voir dire to material questions that, if answered\ntruthfully, would have subject them to a challenge for cause.\n\nTo the extent Rule 6o6 might apply to certain questions asked at the hearing, Ms.\nMaxwell need not inquire into the content of deliberations to establish her jury bias\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9749", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 62 of 66\nrender that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We think that\nthe item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.”’). Moreover, if\nstricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike such\nmaterial from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the\nperformance of the judicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document”\nand would enjoy no presumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the\npublic has a right of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that\n“Tb]efore any such common law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude\nthat the documents at issue are indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9.\n“Once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and that\ntherefore a common law presumption of access ataches, it must determine the weight of\nthat presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the weight of the presumption of\naccess, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against it.’” Jd. at l2o.\n\nThere exists no compelling reason to release Juror No. 5o’s pleadings. Any public\nrelease of the documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and\ncommentary, all of which ls prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s\nrights to fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> proceedings.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9754", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 63 of 66\n\nThe submissions by Juror No. 5o have questionable merit, have not been ruled\nupon, and implicate an ongoing investigation by the parties and the Court into juror\nmisconduct.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6 of 49\nof being a victim of a crime. The Court asked the prospective jurors whether that information or\nthose experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she\nand other women she knous have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor\nanyone she knous has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8:l3-22. Neither the Government nor defense counsel challenged\nJuror 8 for cause.\n\ne Juror 2l wrote in response to Question 48 in her juror questionnaire that\n\n.

Juror 2l indicated that these experiences would not affect\nher ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>?\n\nIn response to additional questioning, she explained that she had reported to her school\nthat her friend was “coerced into a sexual relationship with their professor, kind of\nblackmailed into it, and then paid off by the school to keep it quiet.” Jd. at 54:6-l2. She\nreiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel\nrequested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 2l’s role in the reporting would\n“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-ll. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 2l’s ability\nto be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or\nharassment or the like,” to which Juror 2l responded no.

In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.

Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 24 of 49\nthat must be folloued,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are\nselected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at\nthe trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any\nother ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your\nverdict?” Id. at 43-44.\n\nWith respect to Juror 5o, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of\nactual bias. In a public interview, Juror 5o stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that\nMaxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that\nhis oun experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until\nproven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with\nwhich the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous\nquestions submited over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split\nverdict, in which it acquited the defendant on one count. See United States v. Aiello, 77l F.2d\n62l, 63l (2d Cir. l985) (citing apparent care with which jury approached deliberations and split\nverdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at l74 (citing split verdict as evidence of\nimpartiality). And Juror 5o’s public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir\ndire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follou the law as instructed\nby the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence,\npresented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he\ncould not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28, l3o, l34.\n\nWhile the defendant has not argued for a finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at 38-39), she\nat times alludes to the argument. For example, the defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o\ncalled the defendant a “predator,” said the verdict was for “all the victims,” and commented on a\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9822", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 25 of 49\nTwiter post by Annie Farmer. (Def. Mem. at l3, l5-l6). But he did these things after trial, having\nheard all the evidence that proved that, as the Government argued, the defendant was in fact a\npredator and that the victims, including Farmer, were credible. Juror 5o’s atitudes touards the\ndefendant and the victims after he heard compelling evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the\nvictims’ credible testimony says nothing about the relevant inquiry here: whether he was biased\n“before he heard the evidence presented.” United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 44o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 439\nn.4 (finding no bias where juror in Martha Stewart trial said the verdict was “a victory for the litle\nguy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant “thought she was above everything’’).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant gestures at an actual bias argument when she states that it is\n“clear,” based on Juror 5o’s statements to the media,!? that he was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> “because\nhis personal experiences ‘prevent[ed] or substantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as\na juror.’” (Def. Mem. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit, 469 U.S. 4l2, 424 (l985))). There and\nelsewhere, the defendant’s brief seems to suggest that jurors are required to check their lived\nexperiences at the jury room door. Not so:\n\nWe cannot expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions\n\nof jurors, their additudinal expositions, or their philosophies. These\n\ninvolve the very human elements that constitute one of the strengths\n\nof our jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate\n\nthem from jury deliberations.\nU.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o); see also United States v. Bangiyev,\nNo. o7 Cr. 33l (NG) (RLM), 2oo8 WL 424ooo5, at *lo (E.D.N.Y. Sept. l2, 2oo8) (explaining\n‘8 As noted above, many if not all of the statements upon which the defendant relies describe\ndeliberations and are thus inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). And even if they were not, Juror 5o’s\npublic statements about deliberations in fact demonstrate that he (and the jury more generally) was\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. See infra n.5.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9823", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 49\nthat “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.\nChoudry, 533 F.3d 6ol, 6o6 (7th Cir. 2oo8) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented\nat trial in light of their oun experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts\nabout the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to\nbear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 8l8 & n.5.\n\nHere, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the\nvoir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court\nwould have asked follou-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved\nquestion above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. If he had credibly\ndisclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.\n\ni. Implied Bias\n\nImplied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\nlaw.’” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). That is, a finding of implied bias\ndoes not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average\nman” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that\nthis category is “narrou,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is\nlimited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the\ncrime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related\nto the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at l72 (“[T]he\nDistrict Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be\ninsufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the\ndefendants’ crimes.”).\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 37 of 49\n\nThe defendant also argues that the Court and the parties would have “probed” Juror 5o\nabout whether he was able to “set aside his oun traumatic experience” when evaluating whether\nthe Government met its burden of proof. (Def. Mem. at 44). Juror 5o confirmed both in writing\nand during oral voir dire that he could “[a]bsolutely” “decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, [] presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l6; see id. at\nl3l:l-7 (stating that he had “[n]o doubt” that he “could decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court’); see also Def. Ex. l, Questions l3 & 4l.\nThere is no need for any further inquiry on this subject, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o\nwas truthful when he stated that he could decide the case based on the facts and evidence presented\nin court.\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the Court and the parties would have specifically inquired\nas to whether Juror 5o was able to fairly evaluate Dr. Loftus’s testimony and impartially assess the\ndefendant’s “defense that her accusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and\nmanipulation.” (Def. Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate prospective jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if prospective jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2l, 2ol8); see also United States v. Barnes, 6o4 F.2d l2l, l38 (2d Cir. l979)\n(“[T]he purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to afford individual analysis\nin depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that he believes appropriate for\nhis case.” (quotation marks and citation omited)). Accordingly, it is clear that the Court would\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9835", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror questionnaire. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.

That’s because, as the\nSupreme Court held in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, “the seating of any juror who should\nhave been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 3l6. Thus, irrespective of\nwhether Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 and 48 (though the\nrecord shous he did), his presence on the jury requires reversal if he was impliedly, inferably, or\nactually biased.\n\nSecond, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during any evidentiary hearing.\nOurs is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has a right to present her\narguments to the Court, to call material witnesses in support of those arguments, and to confront\nand cross-examine those witnesses. The government’s request for a narrou and limited hearing\nin which only Juror No. 5o would testify and only the Court would ask questions flies in the face\nof this adversarial process. A hearing conducted on the government’s terms would violate Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional right to assistance of counsel, hamstring the search for the truth, and\ncontravene the tradition and precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9 Cr. 58l (Hon. William H. Pauly IID (Trans. of Motion for New\nTrial). As the government itself argued in Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal\nbackground material so analogous to the case on trial\" had \"bias [] implied as a mater of law”\nand the affected defendant therefore would be entitled to a new trial. Doc. 487, p 2l, United\nStates v. Daugerdas, No. l:o9-cr-oo58l-DLC, Sept. 9, 2oll. This is just such a case.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial elides the stakes\ninvolved and the significance of the constitutional right at issue. Ms. Maxwell was on trial for\nher life. That trial required l2 fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jurors. While paying lip service to the\nrequirement of a fair trial, the government incants the words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9876", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly understood and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit. For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nThose potential jurors admited to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged\nconduct in this case. For example, potential jurors said they were groped or harassed on the\nsubway, harassed at work, or touched inappropriately in a social seting. Resp. at 4-5.\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v.

Juror No. 5o would have been asked to explain what happened to him as a child\nand the impact it had on him. He would have been asked if his oun traumatic, scarring, and life-\nchanging abuse would make him more sympathetic touards the accusers in this case and less\nsympathetic touards Ms. Maxwell.

Regardless of Juror No. 5o’s answers to questions about his\npurported ability to disregard his oun childhood victimization, Ms. Maxwell would have\nchallenged Juror No. 5o for cause and, consistent with other prospective juror challenges, the\nrequest would have been granted by the Court.\n\nAssuming Juror No. 5o recounted any of his beliefs during jury selection, subsequently\ndisclosed by him in the media—such as the abusive event is like a video and victims remember\nthe event accurately—there is no doubt a challenge would have been made, unopposed, and\ngranted.\n\nNou, after having been alerted by the government that he may be in trouble, Juror No. 5o\nhas predictably, either with the assistance of counsel or simple common sense, atempted to\ndisavou his earlier comments and actions, going to great lengths to stress his nou claimed\nignorance of the questions and his ability to be fair.\n\nIf we, the lawyers and jurist in this mater, are being truthful, the essential facts\nsurrounding this issue are not really subject to dispute: (l) whether a prospective juror suffered\nchildhood sexual abuse was a material fact; (2) Juror No. 5o was (or claims to be) a victim of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9879", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto harassment and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv.

These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v.

It involves no\nstrategy or artifice by the defense. And it risks no unauthorized inquiry into the jury room. The\nmotion is about one thing, and one thing only: Every person’s constitutional right to a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. The government hopes to deprive Ms. Maxwell of that right in the name of\n“finality.”\n\nThis Court should disregard the government’s policy arguments, which address\narguments and claims Ms. Maxwell is not making. In turn, the government’s policy arguments\nbetray the weakness of its legal position. And they cast significant doubt on the United States\nsolemn duty to seek justice and not merely to convict. Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 5l, 65-66\n(2oll) (“Prosecutors have a special “duty to seek justice, not merely to convict.”).\n\nB. Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire\nanswers were deliberately false.\n\nThe government insists that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial only if she can prove\nthat Juror No. 5o deliberately provided false answers during voir dire. Not so.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the decision McDonough Pouer Equip. v.\nGreenwood, “does not entirely foreclose a party from seeking a new trial on the basis of a\nprospective juror’s honest, though mistaken, response.” Zerka v.

As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of\nMcDonough, Juror No. 5o’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.\n\nThe government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the\ngovernment mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then atempts to shoot doun the\nstrawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault\nor sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.\nMaxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 5o was impliedly biased—an argument more than\nsupported by the record, Juror No. 5o’s patern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,\nand the statements of Juror No. 5o himself.\n\nLikewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 5o’s\nfalse claims regarding his social media accounts. (Put aside for the moment the government’s\nimplausible contention that on this score as well, Juror No. 5o didn’t mislead the Court, and\nsurely didn’t do so deliberately.) Ms. Maxwell does not contend that Juror No. 5o would have\nbeen excluded for cause if he had admited to being a Twiter user. The point is that Juror No.\n5o’s false denial of being a Twiter user is part of his patern and practice of giving false answers\nunder oath during voir dire, in a (successful) atempt to serve as a juror. “The deliberateness of\nthe particular lies evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo989l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009893.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 24 of 32\nE. This Court should reject the government’s atempt to manufacture a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: were\nyour false answers to Questions 25 and 48 merely inadvertent; and, even though you were a\nvictim of child sexual abuse, isn’t it true that you were a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror (even though\nyou have admited using your oun experience to convince lo other jurors to convict Ms.\nMaxwell)? The government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permited to question Juror No. 5o, as occurred recently in this\njudicial district.? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"We therefore\ncaution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror’s impartiality remains in the\nwake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should\nbe held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased probability of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv. Int’! L.J. 257, 26o (2oo7); see also\nPurvis v. Oest, 6l4 F.3d 7l3, 7l8 (7th Cir. 2olo) (“fundamentally biased process is\nnot due process”); Schacht v. Wis.

The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires consideration of the totality\nof the circumstances. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately. Cf United States v. James, 6o9 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. l979) (“[W]hen\natempting to shou bias or interest, as opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not bound to\naccept the witness’ answer, but is free to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).\n\nThe government disingenuously suggests that the Court \"need not inquire about the\ndetails of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did not probe such details with respect to\nother jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively.\" Resp. at 34 n.l6. Apparently the\ngovernment has forgoten that Question 48a itself (approved of by the government) asked for\ndetails of any affirmative answer to Question 48, and each of the other jurors who answered 48\nin the affirmative provided those details in writen form when they answered Question 48a.\nThere was thus no need for the Court to inquire the details during the live voir dire. For\nexample, the government points to Juror l89 and notes the Court only folloued up with the\nquestion whether a question concerning ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Resp. at 36. Yet Juror\nl89’s answer to 48a contained the details of her alleged abusc\neS\nee.

To the\nextent the Rule might apply as a bar to limit certain questions, it violates Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her. U.S. Const. amends.\nV, VI; cf, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, l37 S. Ct. 855 (2ol7) (finding the no-impeachment rule\nof 6o6(b) unconstitutional as applied to juror statements indicating racial bias). The Rules of\nEvidence cannot constitutionally prevent Ms. Maxwell from proving juror misconduct and\nvindicating her right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.'!\n\n3. The Additional Biased Juror Should Be Questioned\n\nAs detailed in the motion at 2l, a second juror has alerted the New York Times that they\ntoo had deliberated on the case and were the victim of childhood sexual abuse. That juror whose\nidentity is currently unknoun also failed to disclose their victimhood in response to Question\n48.'° The government would like to bury its head in the sand and deprive Ms. Maxwell of the\n\n'! See also Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 & n.3 (holding, before Pena-Rodriguez\nwas decided, that Rule 6o6(b) bars inquiry to “deliberations evidence” when seeking a new trial\nbased on juror false statements during voir dire but recognizing that “[t]here may be cases of\njuror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and\nwhen such a case arises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not\nsufficient to protect the integrity of the process. We need not consider the question, houever, for\nthose facts are not presented here.”’).\n\nWarger doesn’t control here, though, if only because it was a civil and not a criminal\ncase. Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9897", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 32\ncommunications on Twiter and Instagram shortly after trial. Juror No. 5o deliberately mis-\nstated the date of his closing of his Twiter account and therefore Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ndiscovery in order to prove that deliberate falsehood.\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that questionnaire will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his questionnaire at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the questionnaire nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not\ndeliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his questionnaire that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having experienced sexual abuse and were nonetheless qualified as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant. It was entirely appropriate for Juror 5o to sit on this jury, and nothing\nabout his service as a juror calls into question the integrity of the verdict in this case.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo293", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page lo of l6\nwas being considered for as a juror when he went into jury selection and only learned after siting\nin the courtroom for three hours. U/d. at l3:2o-2l, l7:2o-22). He further explained that he\n“honestly never thought [he] would be chosen to sit on this jury” because of the “sheer volume of\npeople” present for jury selection; he thought “surely they will be interviewing thousands of\npeople. And they ultimately choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be\none of those twelve.” (/d. at l2:3-4, l3:l8-25).\n\nThe hearing held by this Court made clear that Juror 5o did not deliberately lie or engage\nin deceit in completing the questionnaire. Juror 5o made an “honest mistake.” (/d. at 23:5). The\ndefendant’s motion fails at the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nB. The Record Does Not Support a Finding that the Court Would Have\n\nGranted a Hypothetical for Cause Challenge\n\nThe hearing established that Juror 5o harbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case based on the evidence and the Court’s legal\ninstructions. If Juror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating to sexual abuse in the\nquestionnaire, the Court would have asked Juror 5o follou up questions during voir dire to\ndetermine if it would have granted a challenge for cause. The Court asked those questions at the\nhearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\nprospective juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many prospective jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl6\n\nAt the hearing, the Court questioned Juror 5o to determine whether, if he had answered\naccurately, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for cause. The record before this Court\nmakes clear that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. The Court began by asking Juror\n5o what his answers would have been to Questions 25(a), 48(b), and 49(b) of the questionnaire,\nwhich asked whether his experience would have prevented him from being a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njuror in this case. Juror 5o repeatedly indicated that he would have answered those questions in\nthe negative. For example, when asked hou he would have answered Question 48(b)—which\nasked if his prior experience with sexual abuse would affect his ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case—Juror 5o responded that his answer “would have been no,\nbecause it did not affect [his] ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> at all.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 9:l5-l6;\nsee also id. at lo:23-24 (“[An accurate answer to Question 25(a)] would have been no. I was\ndefinitely able to set aside everything and be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.”)). Juror 5o unequivocally stated,\n“In no case [would my experience affect my ability to serve fairly and impartially]. It would not\naffect me.” (/d. at l3:l5).\n\nAfter asking Juror 5o hou he would have answered those follou-up questions on the\nquestionnaire, the Court took Juror 5o “back in time” to November l6, 2o2l, the day of voir dire,\nand asked Juror 5o the additional questions it would have asked that day had Juror 5o accurately\nfilled out Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the questionnaire. (/d. at 24:l8-27:l7). In response to the\nCourt’s question as to whether his history of sexual abuse would affect his ability to be a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror, Juror 5o testified that his prior experience with sexual abuse “would not affect [his\nability to be a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror] in any way” and that he would not be “thinking about [his]\noun experience in a way that would prevent [him] from being fair or <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.” (/d. at 25:l7-22,\n27:4-6). Juror 5o explained that there was nothing about his experience that would have affected\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l3 of l6\nsexual assault. In each case, during voir dire, each juror affirmed to the Court that he or she could\nbe fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Not only did the Court not strike each of those eight jurors for cause, but\nneither party even moved to do so on these grounds. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 2o). Thus, if Juror\n5o had disclosed his history of sexual abuse in the writen questionnaire, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, but would have instead asked additional follou-up\nquestions. Juror 5o’s answers to the follou-up questions, as given at the hearing, shoued that he\ncould be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> notwithstanding his prior experience.\n\nThe defendant cannot demonstrate that Juror 5o was biased. At the hearing, Juror 5o\nrepeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the\ndefendant or the Government. (See Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr at 26:l5-2o; see also id. at 27:l3-l7\n(explaining that he had “‘no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides); id. at 26:2l-23 (“Q.\nDid you want to put your thumb on the scale in any direction? A. No.”)). To the contrary, Juror\n5o consistently testified that he was fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> in this case and that he rendered a verdict\nconsistent with the evidence and the Court’s instructions of law.> That testimony is consistent\nwith Juror 5o’s statements during oral voir dire, during which Juror 5o reaffirmed that he was\n“Ta|bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the\ncase based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law. (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l8; see also id. at l3l:l-7; see also id. at\n> Juror 5o’s comment that he was not concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions while\nfilling out the questionnaire (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l8:l7-l8) does not support the defendant’s motion\nfor a new trial. As Juror 5o later explained, that response was derived from the fact that he “began\nto float, fly through it, in order to get done” and was “super distracted.” (/d. at 4o:l8-2o). It did\nnot reflect a general disobedience of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 5o made clear that\nhe carefully folloued the Court’s instructions during voir dire—during which he paid atention to\nthe Court’s instructions, listened carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered every single one of\nthose questions accurately,” and did not “at all” fail “to pay atention to the specifics of the\nquestions”—and during trial.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l5 ofl6\nthe victims in this case—rather, it is quite different. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 8:l4-2o (stating that he\nwas abused at age nine or ten by a family member, and that he disclosed the abuse in high school)).\n\nThere is also no basis in the record for the defendant’s request that the Court infer bias on\nthe part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 37-38). Juror 5o’s testimony does not “permit an\ninference that [he] would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\nInstead, Juror 5o repeatedly testified that he would be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and decide the case based\non the evidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. See id. at 47 n.l2 (“particularly\nwhen considering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable\nbias,” judge may be “persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance”). Just as the Court properly\nelected to not exercise its discretion to infer bias where prospective jurors disclosed during voir\ndire that they had been victims of sexual abuse or harassment, so too should the Court decline to\nmake a finding of inferred bias on the part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 29-3o). Such a finding\nis without any support in the record.\n\nThe testimony given by Juror 5o, under oath, makes clear that he was a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njuror. Because the defendant cannot establish either prong of the McDonough test, let alone both,\nher motion for a new trial is meritless and should be denied.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010307.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagelofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s explanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror were self-serving and simply not believable. Like\nanyone in his position, Juror 5o does not want to be responsible for the retrial of Ghislaine\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nMaxwell, so he atempted to give innocuous explanations for his false questionnaire responses\nand his decision to “tell his story” to the international press follouing trial. In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page6ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nabout hou memory can be corrupted and rendered him incapable of objectively evaluating a\ncentral aspect of Ms. Maxwell’s defense. (Motion at 32-33).\n\nThe Court should not credit Juror 5o’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,\nlet his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the\nevidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes\nthat Juror 5o was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his\nhistory of sexual abuse.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s Answers to the Court’s Questions Were Not Credible and Further\n\nRevealed His Bias\n\nJuror 5o’s responses to the Court’s questions at the Hearing were rife with contradictions\nand inconsistencies. His explanation for his false statements on the jury questionnaire—that he\n“flew through” the questions and did not see that multiple questions called for him to disclose his\nsexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible. Juror 5o’s false statements and his explanation for those false statements, a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\ntrial ended. There is no question that Juror 5o would have knoun (if he didn’t knou before) that\nthat Maxwell trial was all over the press and was the subject of a massive media blitz. Far from\nhoping to remain anonymous, Juror 5o reveled in the atention and started posting his oun\nmessages on social media, using his actual picture and his real first name, announcing to the\nworld that he was on the Maxwell jury. (See Motion at 2o, Juror 5o’s Instagram Account) (“I\ncan nou tell everyone that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.”). Juror 5o was not\nlooking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his l5 minutes of fame. This, again, is\nstrong evidence of Juror 5o’s bias.\n\nWhether Juror 5o’s false responses were for the purpose of securing a spot on the jury or\nbecause he was deluding himself about his ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, Juror 5o’s multiple false\nstatements on the questionnaire and to the Court add to the bases for finding that he should have\nbeen struck for cause. See Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (“Even when prospective jurors are\ndishonest for reasons other than a desire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir\ndire questions indicate that a juror is unwilling or unable to apply the law as instructed by the\ncourt to the evidence presented by the parties and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of\nimpartiality[.]” (internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nFinally, Juror 5o admited that he was perfectly willing to disregard the Court\ninstructions. In light of his statements that he “flew through” the questionnaire, the Court asked\nJuror 5o whether he was concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions. (Tr. l8). Juror 5o\nresponded, “Absolutely not.” (/d.). When the Court asked him again, he again responded “No, I\nreally ... this is a terrible excuse, but I didn’t really think I would be chosen.” (/d.). A\nwillingness to disregard the Court’s instructions shous an inability to serve as an unbiased juror\nand raises independent grounds for a for cause challenge. See Dyer v.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page5of4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers.

Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. /d. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” /d. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at 27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo347", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n6 To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers.

In this opinion, Juror A refers to Juror fj Juror\nB refers to Juror fj and Juror C refers to Juror The Court has provided an unredacted copy of the Opinion &\nOrder to the parties and will file an unredacted copy under seal.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other prospective\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010356.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” Jd. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo356", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 34 of 4o\nCircuit to affirm the district court’s order for a new penalty-phase hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33\n(citing Sampson, 724 F.3d at l68).\n\nThe Defendant next relies on a state court case, State v. Afshar, l96 A.3d 93 (N.H. 2ol8),\nin which a court granted a new trial in a child sexual assault case when a juror failed to disclose\nthat a babysiter sexually assaulted him when he was five or six years old. Maxwell Post-\nHearing Br. at 5; see also Maxwell Br. at 34. But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. Id.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo359", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4o of 4o\nselection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 2o Cr. 33o (AJN), Local Criminal Rule 23.l\nDear Judge Nathan,\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write to request that the Court enter an\norder prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial\nstatements concerning this case. Although Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, the Government,\nits agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue to make, statements prejudicial\nto a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the\nright to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. This fundamental guarantee is part of a criminal defendant’s basic right\nto a fair trial, which requires that a defendant must be judged by a jury of her peers based on\nevidence presented at trial, not in the media. The Court, to safeguard the due process rights of the\naccused, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of prejudicial pretrial\npublicity.” Gannet Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 378 (l979). This District has given effect\nto this Sixth Amendment right through Local Criminal Rule 23.l. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell\nrequests that the Court exercise its express pouer under Local Criminal Rule 23.l(h) and enter\nan Order requiring compliance with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial\npretrial publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.\nLegal Standard\nMore than fifty years ago, warning of the danger of pretrial publicity to fair trials, the\nSupreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that will protect\ntheir processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,\nthe accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the\ncourt should be permited to frustrate its function.” Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363\n(l966) (emphasis added).\nApp.o3l\nDOJ-OGR-oool949o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019491.jpg": "OGsedl ZAD Aa S BOs ATT tide WH 2o2 F i62l /PAg eagei2i ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn an effort to protect the trial process from “prejudicial outside interferences,” this Court\npromulgated Local Criminal Rule 23.l(a) which provides, in relevant part, that:\n\nIt is the duty of the lawyer or law firm, ... and government agents\nand police officers, not to release or authorize the release of non-\npublic information or opinion which a reasonable person would\nexpect to be disseminated by means of public communication, in\nconnection with pending or imminent criminal litigation with\nwhich they are associated, if there is a substantial likelihood that\nsuch dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise\nprejudice the due administration of justice.\n\nTo avoid any confusion this Court identified seven “subject maters” that “presumptively\ninvolve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or\notherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.” /d. at (d). Accordingly, lawyers for parties\nand witnesses and their agents are prohibited from publicly disseminating information\nconcerning:\n\n(l) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of crime), or\n\nthe character or reputation of the accused...;\n\n(2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by the\n\naccused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;\n\n(3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure to\n\nsubmit to an examination or test;\n\n(4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the lawyer\n\nor law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not otherwise\n\nprohibited by law;\n\n(5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;\n\n(6) Information the lawyer or law firm knous is likely to be inadmissible at trial and\n\nwould if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> trial; and\n\n(7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or\n\nthe evidence in the case.\n\nId. at (d)(l-7) (emphasis added).\nApp.o32\nDOJ-OGR-oool949l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019497.jpg": "Odsed Aare SBOsATIn tidc MASH 262 (F iRABE7ALB/Pe gage CARL\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED |\nDOC #: ;\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:7/23/2o2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Maxwell suggests that the Gov-\nernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-\nprincipled” reasons. (Br. 29-3o). Seting Maxwell’s\nconspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.\nMaxwell are in completely different procedural pos-\ntures, which implicate different concerns regarding a\npending criminal case. The later was resolved in 2ol7\nand the determination of what material should remain\nsealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there\nis no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case\nand no possible concern to the Government that, for\nexample, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might\nbe deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that\na document may be unsealed through an independent\nprocess before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-\nernment’s investigative focus or techniques.\n\nIn Doe v.

If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other\ndefendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.\n\nIt is debatable whether the public has a “right to knou” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions\nof confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The\ngovernment safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release\nany unless mandated by statute or court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell\nthe same treatment.\n\nShould the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be\nlimited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s right to a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020946.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\n\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020948.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel22 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 5 of 4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers.

Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43. A court may find a\njuror to be partial because the juror admits as much, or based on the juror’s other voir dire\nanswers. Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968)). This finding is\n“based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility.” /d. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Wit,\n469 U.S. 4l2, 428 (l985)).\n\nThe record does not support a finding that Juror 5o was actually biased. As explained\nabove, the Court finds Juror 5o’s sworn testimony to be credible overall. He was responsive and\nforthright, and his demeanor evinced that he answered the Court’s questions truthfully. He\nrepeatedly and credibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual abuse would not affect his\nability to serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror “in any way.” Hearing Tr. at 25; see also id. at 9, lo,\nl3. He testified that there was “absolutely in no way” anything about his experience that would\ninterfere with his “ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse,” and that he\nwould be able to conclude such a witness was not testifying truthfully if that was what the\nevidence suggested. /d. at 26. He testified that he did not harbor any bias against the Defendant\nnor any bias in favor of the Government. Indeed, he did not want to put his “thumb on the scale\nin any direction.” Jd. He declared that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides.\nId. at27. As noted above, the Defendant dismisses these responses as “self-serving.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 7. The Court disagrees; it finds each of these responses to be credible.\n\nMoreover, Juror 5o’s hearing testimony is corroborated by his answers during voir dire.\nWithout hesitation, he declared that he would follou the Court’s instructions on the law, he\n“absolutely” could decide the case based on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in court,\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o967", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020969.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel43 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020971.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel45 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48,\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . .. who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause.

At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse.

This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 prospective jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional prospective jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those prospective\njurors stated that they could not be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>.” Stewart, 3l7 F.

Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o973", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o974", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020976.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel5o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 33 of 4o\nremoval.” /d. Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l.

But that juror had previously reported an inability\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> in another case involving sexual assault of a minor, and the court concluded that\nthere was “litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could have differentiated between\nthe two cases.” l96 A.3d at 98. Such is not the case here.\n\nFinally, in Burton v. Johnson, the Tenth Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly\nbiased when she suffered an abusive relationship with her husband that was highly similar to that\nof the defendant. 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-59 (loth Cir. l99l). Houever, not only had that juror\ndeliberately lied during voir dire about the experience, but she was also living in that abusive\nsituation during voir dire, the trial itself, and her post-verdict testimony to the court. /d.\nConversely, Juror 5o credibly testified that his abuse “happened so long ago” that it is not\nsomething that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not part of who [he is].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,\nthe Court has not found that Juror 5o deliberately lied about his personal history.\n\nThe Defendant’s remaining arguments also fail to alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror\n5o is not biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 5o’s post-trial conduct—in particular, his\nposts on social media and his decision to give interviews using his picture and first name—is\n“strong evidence” of his bias because he was “not looking to avoid notice,” but rather to “soak\nup his l5 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at lo-ll. The Court disagrees that this\nconduct reveals bias. Whether wise or foolish, the fact that a juror may give an interview\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o977", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020979.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel53 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o979", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses.

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar consideration of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\nconsideration of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity.

Each confirmed that he or she could be\nfair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>, and defense counsel did not move\nto strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer\nto Question 48. (A.345).\n\nFor instance, one juror said that she was “sexually\nmolested by an uncle when she was l2 or l8,” but that\nwould not affect her ability to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> in\nthe case. (A.345).

(/d.). Neither\nthe Government nor defense counsel challenged those\njurors for cause.\n\nThe parties then exercised their peremptory\nstrikes, and a jury was seated.\n\n2. Juror 5o\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire and was\nquestioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his\nquestionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he\ncould be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. In response to Question l3,\n\nl2 Twelve of the 58 qualified prospective jurors in-\ndicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-\ntim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-\nsault.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021712.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page65 of 93\n52\n\nhe indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,\nand not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-\npathy, or prejudice.” (A.295). He also accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a\ncriminal case is presumed innocent and the Govern-\nment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (A.294). Juror 5o indicated that there was noth-\ning about the nature of the case and the accusations as\nsummarized in the questionnaire that might make it\ndifficult for him to be fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span>. (A.3o8; see\nalso A.3lo). He repeated these assurances at oral voir\ndire. (See Voir Dire Tr.l28-34).\n\nJuror 5o checked the “no” box in response to Ques-\ntion 48, which asked whether he or a friend or family\nmember had ever been the victim of sexual harass-\nment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. (A.3lo). He also\nchecked the “no” box in response to the question of\nwhether he or any of his relatives or close friends had\never been a victim of a crime. (A.299).\n\nJuror 5o was seated. Follouing the verdict, he dis-\ncussed his experience as a juror during interviews with\nmultiple journalists. During these interviews, Juror 5o\nstated that he was a survivor of childhood sexual\nabuse, which he did not disclose until high school, and\nthat his experience of sexual abuse did not affect his\nability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven\nguilty. (A.249). He also stated that he did not recall the\ndetails of the juror questionnaire, which he “flew\nthrough,” but he believed he answered the questions\nhonestly. (A.245, 262).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021721.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page74 of 93\n6l\n2o2l) (holding that district court “properly recognized\nthat the initial question to be explored is whether the\njuror’s nondisclosure was deliberate or inadvertent”),\nvacated on other grounds, l42 S. Ct. 28638 (2o22), rein-\nstated, 58 F.4th 72, 75 (2d Cir. 2o23).\n\nMaxwell’s claim also fails at the second step of\nMcDonough. The hearing established that Juror 5o\nharbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case\nbased on the evidence and the District Court’s legal in-\nstructions. As Judge Nathan found, “Juror 5o’s credi-\nble responses [to questions asked of all jurors who in-\ndicated prior personal experience with sexual abuse]\nunder oath at the hearing established that he would\nnot have been struck for cause if he had provided ac-\ncurate responses to the questionnaire.” (A.34o). If Ju-\nror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating\nto sexual abuse in the questionnaire, Judge Nathan\nwould have asked Juror 5o follou-up questions during\nvoir dire to determine if it would have granted a chal-\nlenge for cause. Judge Nathan asked those questions\nat the hearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made\nclear that he was a fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been ex-\ncused for cause.\n\nNor was Juror 5o the subject of any bias, actual,\nimplied, or inferred. After assessing Juror 5o’s de-\nmeanor, Judge Nathan found that he “repeatedly and\ncredibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual\nabuse would not affect his ability to serve as a fair and\n<span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror ‘in any way’” (A.34l-42), belying any\nsuggestion that he was actually biased against\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l72l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021724.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page77 of 93\n64\nJuror 5o credibly testified at the hearing that he was\nable to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and\njudge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-\ntreme situation that call[s] for mandatory removal.”\n(A.349 (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 46)).\n\nMore generally, it is entirely appropriate for jurors\nto “rely on their common sense and life experiences to\nadjudge guilt.” (A.352). These “very human elements\n... constitute one of the strengths of our jury system,\nand we cannot and should not excommunicate them\nfrom jury deliberations.” (A.353 (quoting United States\nex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l38, 8l8 (2d Cir.\nl97o)). On these facts, “[t]o imply or infer that Juror\n5o was biased—simply because he was himself a vic-\ntim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testi-\nmony under the penalty of perjury, establishing that\nhe could be an even-handed and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror—\nwould be tantamount to concluding that an individual\nwith a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair\nand <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror in such a trial. That is not the law,\nnor should it be.” (A.346-47).\n\nFinally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan\nabused her discretion by precluding defense counsel\nfrom questioning Juror 5o, and precluding inquiry into\nJuror 5o’s “statements to journalists.” (Br.7o). As to\nthe former, the manner in which the hearing proceeds\nis commited to a district court’s “sound discretion,”\nMoten, 582 F.2d at 666, including specifically the “ex-\ntent to which the parties may participate in question-\ning the witnesses,” lannielo, 866 F.2d at 544. Judge\nNathan reasonably decided to lead the questioning\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l724", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021725.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page78 of 93\n65\nherself, with repeated opportunities both before and\nduring the hearing for counsel to suggest questions.\nAnd Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s\nrequests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-\nnas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond\nJuror 5o’s ability to be an <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> juror and instead\nprobed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69).\nAs to Juror 5o’s “statements to journalists,” it is not\nentirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks\nshould have been part of the hearing. The hearing of\ncourse covered both the substance of his sexual abuse\nand the fact of his statements to journalists. (See, e.g.,\nA.275 (asking whether Juror 5o understood “from your\ninterviews that the fact that you were abused would be\na knoun fact in the world.”)). It appears that, in Max-\nwell’s view, Judge Nathan should have inquired into\nwhether and hou his sexual abuse affected the delib-\nerations in the jury room. (Br.7l (suggesting that Ju-\nror 5o “operate[d] as an unsworn expert on the subject\nof traumatic memory”)). Acknouledging Rule 6o6(b)’s\nprohibition on inquiry into jurors’ deliberations and\nmental processes, Maxwell argues that the exception\nfor “extraneous prejudicial information [that] was im-\nproperly brought to the jury’s atention,” Fed. R. Evid.\n6o6(b)(2)(A), applies here. (Br.7l). But Maxwell ex-\npressly waived this argument in the District Court, ex-\nplaining that she “[d]oes not seek to impeach the ver-\ndict based on the content of deliberations” and “need\nnot inquire into the content of deliberations to estab-\nlish her jury bias claim.” (Dkt.6l3 at 49-5o). And in\nany event, the exception does not apply because the\n“experiences that jurors are understood to bring with\nthem to the jury room” are “internal maters” that do\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021761.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Pagel9 of 35\nPOINT II\n(Point IV in Appellant’s Principal Brief)\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CREDITING A JUROR’S\nPATENTLY DISHONEST TESTIMONY OFFERED TO EXPLAIN FALSE\nANSWERS TO MATERIAL QUESTIONS IN VOIR DIRE AND FURTHER\nERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT HONEST ANSWERS TO THOSE SAME\n\nQUESTIONS WOULD HAVE NOT PROVIDED A VALID BASIS TO\nREMOVE THE JUROR FOR CAUSE.\n\nJuror honesty is the bedrock of the criminal jury system.

The indictment describes the charged offenses\n\nwith specificity\n\nMaxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for\nlack of specificity or in the alternative to compel the\nGovernment to submit a bill of particulars providing\ngreater detail of the charges. The Court concludes that\nthe charges in the Sl superseding indictment are clear\nenough.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an\nindictment must contain “a plain, concise, and definite\nwriten statement of the essential facts constituting\nthe offense charged.” The indictment must be specific\nenough to inform the defendant of the charges and\nallou the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later\nprosecution based on the same events. United States v.\nStavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. l992). “Under\nthis test, an indictment need do litle more than to\ntrack the language of the statute charged and state the\ntime and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged\ncrime.” United States. v.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and <span class=\"highlight\">impartial</span> administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\nIntellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o39"};
