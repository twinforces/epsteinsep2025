In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo992", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000996.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGUsnt BOM 22o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage di226lol9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts.

In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away ae Ms. Maxwell\nnoved i so that she could i be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A §\nl2) (“|Ghislaine| was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> in\nDecember 2ol9, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her\nairest. (See Ex. B) (“|S|he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001125.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FOd3GouAuNt DibeuMe/tl $7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a edged 29 2o45\n\nThe government argued to the Court that defense counsel’s contact with the\nprosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell’s arrest prove litle about her intent to\nstay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001159.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 a ded gect 7l Ob 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\ninconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with a and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play. Even assuming the defendant could be located and\napprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and\n> Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established\na trust account in or about 2ol8, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide\npersonal information, including marital status. On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll59", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001169.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deageck 7l Ob 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex.

As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001211.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGuIAnt DOciunef ll86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page agehilGh22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l2 of l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank”).

The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant.

Because plain vanilla surrenders lack\nthe fanfare and atendant media coverage afforded to secret, armed, raids at dawn, the\nGovernment chose to invade Ms. Maxwell’s New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> residence, arrest her, and stage a\nmedia presentation that included numerous statements that prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\nfair trial.\n\nImmediately follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, Acting U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss held\na press conference in which she commented on Ms. Maxwell’s credibility and her incorrect\nopinions concerning “guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the\ncase” in violation of Local Rule 23.l(d)(l), (4) and (7):\n\nPer the New York Law Journal:\n\n‘Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,’ Strauss said\n\nat a press conference announcing the charges. ‘Maxwell enticed minor girls, got\n\nthem to trust her and then delivered them into the trap that that she and Epstein\n\nhad set for them. She pretended to be a woman they could trust, all the while she\n\nwas seting them up to be sexually abused by Epstein and, in some cases, by\n\nMaxwell herself.’!\n\nAs reported in the Washington Post,\n\nStrauss, the acting U.S. atorney in Manhatan, said the socialite told that lie and\n\nothers in deposition because the truth ‘was almost unspeakable.’\n\nActing U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss called the sex abuse described in the\n\nMaxwell case ‘the prequel’ to the charges they lodged against Epstein....\n\nMaxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend, and groom\n\nminor victims for abuse’ ... ‘In some cases Maxwell participated in the abuse\n\nitself.’\n\n! htps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2o2o/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-in-\nconnection-with-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-ring/?slreturn=2o2oo6l4l2492l\n\n* htps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-\nepstein/2o2o/o7/o2/2oc745o2-bc69-l lea-8cf5-9clb8d7f84c6_story.html\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool637", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 27 Filed o7/2l/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” /d.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction.

Ms. Maxwell’s Counsel Was in Regular Contact with the Government\nPrior to Her Arrest\n\nAt no time, houever, did Ms. Maxwell intend to flee or hide from the government, as the\ngovernment argued at the last bail hearing. In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away [in Ms. Maxwell\nmoved i so that she could be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A J\nl2) (“[Ghislaine] was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> in\nDecember 2ol9, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her\narrest. (See Ex. B) (“[S]he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ooo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 29 of 45\n\nThe government argued to the Court that defense counsel’s contact with the\nprosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell’s arrest prove litle about her intent to\nstay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from\nP| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). FY statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002085.jpg": "2o-cr- - cument 97-l9 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3of5\n\nSC\npF\na _\nLe\npo\nee\n\npress intrusion into her personal space.

While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\ninconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with Fo and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition.

Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play.

On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 27 of 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2 of 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

Moreover,\nwhen Ms. Maxwell was arrested, the arresting agents found nothing suggesting that she planned\nto abscond. Finally, unlike A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent evidence supporting\nan alternative explanation for her actions that rebuts any inference that she intended to flee.\n\nHence, if it was improper for the trial court to allou the introduction of flight evidence in\nAl-Sadawi, it would be even more improper for the Court to do so here.

See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the procedure itself was unduly suggestive.

The Court cannot\nheal the wounds caused by Epstein by heaping on Ms. Maxwell’s shoulders the pain of every one\nof his victims, the outrage of society, the public scorn of the community, and then driving her out\nof the community forever. While that may assuage the public and give the perception that “justice\nwas done,” that is not justice. That is scapegoating. Ms. Maxwell must be sentenced on the record\nbefore the Court and not these external pressures.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell’s Arrest and Detention\n\nAt dawn on July 2, 2o2o, a team of more than a dozen FBI agents arrested Ms. Maxwell at\nthe New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> home where she had taken refuge after Epstein’s death to escape the upsurge\nof highly intrusive media coverage that had engulfed her and her family. She had relocated alone,\nseparating from her family to safeguard her husband and two young stepchildren and to secure the\npersonal safety of her family and herself. At that time, Ms. Maxwell was the target of numerous\ndeath threats and threats of violence and was being hunted by the press. One media outlet even\noffered a $lo,ooo bounty for information about her whereabouts. Tragically, this experience was\nnot new for Ms. Maxwell. Decades earlier, when Ms. Maxwell was just a child and her father was\na Member of Parliament, U.K. authorities found a “hit list” of potential kidnapping/assassination\ntargets in a safehouse used by the Irish Republican Army. Ms. Maxwell’s name was first on the\nlist. This unnerving experience has haunted her, heightening her vigilance and concerns about the\nwelfare and safety of her young stepchildren, who were being hounded by the media at school and\n* htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7J4ReLHvag, at 2:o9-2:l5.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo452", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 _ Filed o6/l5/22 Page/7of77\nat the beach; and her husband, who was besieged by media coverage and had lost his employment\nand professional relationships. Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015234.jpg": "(Eds) The study of eyewitness testimony: Seeking for the bridge between law and psychology.

Because plain vanilla surrenders lack\nthe fanfare and atendant media coverage afforded to secret, armed, raids at dawn, the\nGovernment chose to invade Ms. Maxwell’s New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> residence, arrest her, and stage a\nmedia presentation that included numerous statements that prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s right to a\nfair trial.\n\nImmediately follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, Acting U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss held\na press conference in which she commented on Ms. Maxwell’s credibility and her incorrect\nopinions concerning “guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the\ncase” in violation of Local Rule 23.l(d)(l), (4) and (7):\n\nPer the New York Law Journal:\n\n‘Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,’ Strauss said\n\nat a press conference announcing the charges. ‘Maxwell enticed minor girls, got\n\nthem to trust her and then delivered them into the trap that that she and Epstein\n\nhad set for them. She pretended to be a woman they could trust, all the while she\n\nwas seting them up to be sexually abused by Epstein and, in some cases, by\n\nMaxwell herself.’!\n\nAs reported in the Washington Post,\n\nStrauss, the acting U.S. atorney in Manhatan, said the socialite told that lie and\n\nothers in deposition because the truth ‘was almost unspeakable.’\n\nActing U.S. Atorney Audrey Strauss called the sex abuse described in the\n\nMaxwell case ‘the prequel’ to the charges they lodged against Epstein...\n\nMaxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend, and groom\n\nminor victims for abuse’ ... ‘In some cases Maxwell participated in the abuse\n\nitself.’\n\n! htps://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2o2o/o7/o2/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-in-\nconnection-with-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-ring/?slreturn=2o2oo6l4l2492l\n\n* htps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-\nepstein/2o2o/o7/o2/2oc745o2-bc69-l lea-8cf5-9clb8d7f84c6_story.html\n\nApp.o33\nDOJ-OGR-oool9492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019493.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en (dc WHE 2o2 FiRAB62 8l /Pageyei4l ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nAlthough Ms. Strauss sprinkled her comments with the phrase “as alleged,” she presented\ncertain of her statements as fact.? Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” Jd.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual satisfaction. So to the degree\n\nthat um there was a main facilitator that started the whole thing, it was Ghislaine.\n\n3 A purported transcript of the press conference is contained on the internet at\nhtps://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/announcement-transcript-of-charges-against-ghislaine-\nmaxwell-in-new-york-jeffrey-epstein-associate-arrested.\n\n* htps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ghislaine-maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-\nepstein/2o2o/o7/o2/2oc745o2-bc69-l lea-8cf5-9clb8d7f84c6_story.html\n\n> htps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDK Hdzix2k\n\nApp.o34\nDOJ-OGR-oool9493", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019698.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Page5d of l9\n\no6/29/2o2o l | SEALED INDICTMENT as to Sealed Defendant l (l) count(s) l, 2, 3, 4, 5-6.

In July 2o2o, she was living peacefully\nin her New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> home and was in contact, through her atorneys,\nwith the U.S. Atorney’s office in the Southern District New York,\nwhich had opened an investigation into her only after the death of\nJeffrey Epstein.

(FBI New York Assistant Director William Sweeney\nJr.: “We'd been discretely keeping tabs on Maxwell’s whereabouts as we\nworked this investigation.”)\n\nThe fact that she was holed up in her home because she was being\nrelentlessly harassed by the media is not evidence of hiding from the\ngovernment.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

The defendant clearly\nhas the means to flee.\n\nMore troubling still, the defendant’s conduct at the time of her arrest further underscores\nthe risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> on the morning of July 2, 2o2o, they discovered the property was barred by a locked\ngate. After breaching the gate, the agents observed an individual who was later determined to be\na private security guard. As the agents approached the front door to the main house, they\nannounced themselves as FBI agents and directed the defendant to open the door. Through a\nwindou, the agents saw the defendant ignore the direction to open the door and, instead, try to flee\nto another room in the house, quickly shuting a door behind her. Agents were ultimately forced\nto breach the door in order to enter the house to arrest the defendant, who was found in an interior\nroom in the house. Moreover, as the agents conducted a security sweep of the house, they also\nnoticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade\ndetection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or\nintercept her communications, but by law enforcement.\n\nFollouing the defendant’s arrest, the FBI spoke with the security guard, who informed the\nagents that the defendant’s brother had hired a security company staffed with former members of\nthe British military to guard the defendant at the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property, in rotations. The\ndefendant provided one of the guards with a credit card in the same name as the LLC that had\npurchased the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant\nhad not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool99lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019914.jpg": "CaSade2ZOtehQd3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL) 26a Geagpeot 2 GP l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them.

In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the financial resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed financial\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9.

The package before Judge Berman was only\n\n5 two suretors, and any properties that were offered to\n\n6 Judge Berman at the proceeding were already subject to\n\n7 forfeiture and so could not be proposed. So it is a very, very\n8 different situation in that case which was not raised by the\n\n9 government, and that's why we didn't address it.\n\nlo The last point which I meant to raise earlier, your\n\nll Honor, and I will end with this, and I should have raised it\n\nl2 earlier, what we sometimes see in bail cases, and I'm sure your\nl3 Honor has seen this, is the government says, well, the\n\nl4 defendant was hiding and we have evidence, your Honor, that the\nl5 defendant was making plans to leave the country.

In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away ae Ms. Maxwell\nnoved i so that she could i be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A §\nl2) (“|Ghislaine| was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> in\nDecember 2ol9, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her\nairest. (See Ex. B) (“|S|he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo42", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020043.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebB23A/ Pag Page 2O26lo45\n\nThe government argued to the Court that defense counsel’s contact with the\nprosecutors in the months leading up to Ms. Maxwell’s arrest prove litle about her intent to\nstay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms.\nMaxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the\nintensity of the press atention, her counsel would have provided that information had the\ngovernment asked for it. The government never did.\n\n3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”\nHiding\n\nSimilarly, had the government reached out to defense counsel before Ms. Maxwell’s\narrest, we would have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that\nchance. Instead, the government arrested her in a totally unnecessary early morning raid\nwith multiple federal agents at her residence in New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, on the eve of the one-year\nanniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell\nwas hiding from them. That is simply not the case.\n\nThe government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that\nshe moved herself into an interior room when the officers approached the house and that\nthey found a cell phone wrapped in tin foil—evidence an atempt to evade law enforcement.\n(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself\nfrom the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).\n\nSince the hearing, we have obtained the accompanying statement from El\n| the head of the security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,\nwhich was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex. S). Es statement\ndemonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not avoiding arrest, but was follouing an agreed-upon\nprocedure to protect herself in the event of a potential threat to her safety or security.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo43", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020077.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctuMert loo2 Filed6R238/PHgPagetl76sf 36\ntime of her arrest. While a friend’s desire to avoid publicity may be understandable, a spouse’s\ndesire to distance himself in that manner—particularly when coupled with the defendant’s\ninconsistent statements about the state of their relationship—undermine her assertion that her\nmarriage is a tie that would keep her in the United States. As for the defendant’s asserted\nrelationships with a and other relatives in the United States, the defendant did not\nappear to have an issue living alone without these relatives while she was in hiding in New\n<span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span>, which undercuts any suggestion that these ties would keep her in the United States. In\nany event, the defendant could easily receive visits from her family members while living abroad,\nand, as noted, the defendant has multiple family members and friends who live abroad.\n\nIn addition to those foreign connections and ample means to flee discussed further belou,\nthe defendant will have the ability, once gone, to frustrate any potential extradition. Atempting\nto dounplay that concern, the defense relies on two legal opinions to claim that the defendant can\nirrevocably waive her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom and France.\n(Mot. at 25; Def. Ex. U; Def. Ex. V). But the defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “irrevocable\nwaiver of her extradition rights” is ultimately meaningless: it provides no additional reassurance\nwhatsoever and, with respect to France, is based on an erroneous assessment of France’s position\non the extradition of its nationals. (Mot. at 25).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government would need to seek the arrest of the defendant before\nsuch a waiver would even come into play. Even assuming the defendant could be located and\napprehended—which is quite an assumption given the defendant’s access to substantial wealth and\n> Adding to this confusion, bank records reflect that when the defendant and her spouse established\na trust account in or about 2ol8, they filled out forms in which they were required to provide\npersonal information, including marital status. On those forms, both the defendant and her spouse\nlisted their marital status as “single.” It is unclear why the defendant did not disclose her marital\nstatus to the bank, but that lack of candor on a bank form mirrors her lack of candor with Pretrial\nServices in this case, discussed further belou.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020087.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGANAt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R298/PtagPagel Tost 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex.

As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020129.jpg": "CaGade2ZOter)d3GouAuNt Bibsutre/tl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9g FAgef A Ob 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation.

Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New <span class=\"highlight\">Hampshire</span> property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5.
