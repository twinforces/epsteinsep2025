Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001360.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+ANNt B6euMesnt 2962 Filed/o4/o6/PagPage 22a 6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation.

Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation.

But even\ngranting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,\nunpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the exclusion—younger people moving more |\noften—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )\n658 (concluding that a jury system that led to undeliverable questionnaires did not constitute ,\nsystematic exclusion}. At botom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth\nAmendment violation because of hou often people move residences throughout the District.\nThird, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> reliance on voter registration lists\nconstitutes systematic exclusion. This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\nAmendment’s guarantee of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the exclusion of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic exclusion because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters.

The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC.

(Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information\nprovided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s\nconfinement over the last two months.\n\nThe defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate\nat the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per\nday, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant still has access to both a\ndesktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on\nwhich to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the\nMDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her atorneys. This discovery review\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s assigned cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant continues to be permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day\nroom, the defendant continues to have <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop,\na television, a phone on which to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer.

As we\nexplained in Commonwealth v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the Commonwealth’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\nCommonwealth v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004922.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-3 Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nIN RE GRAND JURY SUBPOENA SEALED ORDER |\nl9 Misc. l49 |\nUpon the Affirmation and Application of the United |\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of New York, by |\nAssistant United States Atorney Alex Rossmiller, pursuant to :\nthe All Writs Act, Title 28, United States Code, Section l65l, |\n:\nrequesting that an Order be issued relieving Boies Schiller & |\nFlexner LLP of their obligations under the protective order |\nissued on March l8, 2ol6 in case Virginia L.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-<span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span>\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5l69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-4 Filed o9/o7/2l Page l5 of 22\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present.

Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel.

Experience indicates that in the majority of situations\nquestioning by counsel would be more likely to fulfill this need [for\ninformation upon which to base the intelligent exercise of\nperemptory challenges] than an <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> examination in general\nterms by the trial Court.\nUnited States v. Ible, 63o F.2d 389, 395 (Sth Cir. l98o).\n\nIn this case, voir dire conducted solely by the Court will interfere with the intelligent\nexercise of peremptory challenges. Atorneys have been working on this case well over a year.\nThey are most likely to knou the areas of questioning that must be explored to further uncover\nthe prejudices that are most pertinent to the evidence that will be presented at trial. They also act\nwith an awareness that they will have to base peremptory challenges on the juror's answers.\nPermiting atorney-conducted voir dire in addition to Court voir dire will therefore maximize the\ninformation obtained in voir dire.\n\nB. The Extensive Pretrial Publicity Related to This Case Necessitates Atorney-\n\nConducted Voir Dire\n\nThe possibility of prejudice in this case due to the extensive pretrial publicity is so great\nthat specific voir dire questions by counsel are necessary. In United States v. Davis, the Fifth\nCircuit held that the district court erred in not undertaking a more thorough examination of panel\nmembers exposed to publicity (“[W]here the nature of the publicity as a whole raised a\nsignificant possibility of prejudice, the cursory questioning by the court was not enough.”). A\ndistrict court is required, under Davis, to determine what each juror may have heard or read and\nhou it may have affected his atitude touard the trial, and whether any juror’s impartiality had\nbeen destroyed. /d; see also Silverthorne v.

Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII.

At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4lo-l Filed ll/o4/2l Page 3 of 93\nRole of the Jury\n\nYour role is to pass upon and decide the fact issues that are in the case.

It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 8ofl6\nIndependent\nEpstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nPROTOCOL\nMay 29, 2o2o\nI. PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-<span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span>\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document562 Filed l2/l7/2l Page /7 of 82\n\n] Instruction No. 2: Role of the Jury\n\n2 Your role is to pass upon and decide the fact issues that are in the case.

Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d at 48 (finding two conspiracies were\nmultiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed in the second conspiracy were not listed\nin the first, because they were “all in furtherance of the broader conspiracy alleged in the first’’).\n\nD. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of\n\nInterdependence\n\nFinally, the government argues that Counts Three and Five were different conspiracies\nbecause they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and modes of\noperation.” (Opp. at 32). In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘massage appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537). She also testified that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his island. (Tr.\nl534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> to Count Five.

Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to\nissues requiring its atention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for\ntrial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous administrative\ncomplaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,\nthe Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the\ndefendant’s complaints of physical abuse and concluded that they are unfounded. Legal counsel\nat the MDC further informed the Government that all pat-doun searches of the defendant that took\nplace pretrial were, in fact, video recorded.\n\nTaken together with the defendant’s perjury in her civil deposition, her lies to Pretrial\nServices, and her blatant lies about her oun weight while in BOP custody, the Court can fairly\nreject many of the defendant’s complaints about her conditions of confinement.

In the day room, the defendant\nhad <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to a telephone, a television, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page3of7\nsentiment, a sentiment that was also conveyed to me personally, repeatedly and pleadingly by the\nvictims themselves.\n\n8.

This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-<span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram.

To\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filedo7/l5/22 Page 4ofl7\nI. General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page5ofl7\nClaimant, as well as overall Program operations and administration. The\nEstate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nDecisions of the Administrator are not subject to review or modification in any\nway by the Estate or any other party or entity.\n\n4. Hou much money from Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate is available to the Program?\nThere is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be\nmade to each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated\nseparately by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her\nsole and <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of\ncompensation.\n\n5. When did the Program become effective?\n\nThe Program became effective on June 25, 2o2o (“Effective Date”). The\nAdministrator has reached out to previously identified victims and will\nprovide other individuals with an opportunity to participate in the Program\nthrough an online registration process, described in Section III belou.\n\nIl. Eligibility Requirements\n\nl. Who is eligible to participate in the Program?\n\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein, regardless of where they were harmed, when they were harmed,\nwhether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and\nwhether they have previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein\nand/or the Estate.\n\n2. If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation. That eligibility determination is\nmade only after you submit the Claim Form and all required documentation,\nand after that information is evaluated by the Administrator.

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020277.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNit Di euitren2l9@2 lFited 547o6/249 Pagel 2 af 6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has <span class=\"highlight\">exclusive</span> access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation.
