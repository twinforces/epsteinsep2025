Nathan\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nSo to cooperate in the way that that kind of rumors out there would mean that\n\nshe’s cooperating dounwards. She’d be cooperating with people who are much\n\nless culpable than her. Will she name names to try to shave years off of what\nwould be a lengthy prison sentence maybe, I think you should probably expect\nthat if she’s going to share information that’s going to actually help her, it’s\nprobably gonna be about unrelated crimes that she may be aware about because\nwith respect to this particular operation, in terms of living people, she’s as high as\n\nit gets. ... I think like most of my clients would really hope that she does\n\ncooperate, at least shares the information that she has. I mean I knou that it\n\nwould only be to help herself but the public deserves to knou who was involved\nbesides her and Jeffrey Epstein, and only she knous that.\n\nThe violations of Rule 23.l did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and detention.\nFollouing the detention hearing on July l4, 2o2o, Mr. Boies, counsel for one of the accusers\nwho spoke at the hearing, commented on the content of the hearing. As reported by <span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span>,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l4 Filed o7/l2/2l  Page4of7\nPage 4\n\nwriten agreement, as opposed to an informal promise like the one in Cosby.\n\nThis is not consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.\n(emphasis added).\n\nThe press (including <span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span>, NBC, the New York Post, and Forbes)‘ reported\non this argument by Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. Accordingly, there is no substantial\nlikelihood that the Op-Ed, which made the very same arguments that were made by\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers and covered extensively in the press, will interfere with a fair\ntrial, and the Government does not even really atempt to argue to the contrary.®\n\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell’s family, and undersigned as counsel for her family, have\nthe right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are\nspeaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.\nAs Justice Kennedy explained in Gentile, “in some circumstances press comment is\nnecessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse.” Such “statements have\nthe full protection of the First Amendment.” Gentile, 5ol U.S. at lo58 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring).\n\nThe press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage\nof Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the\nmaters at issue. It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage\nis pro-government and anti-Maxwell. The press has already tried and convicted her.\nAnd the Government has done nothing to control its surrogates, which has only made\nthe problem worse.

Rocchio’s testimony thus runs the significant “risk of being the ipse dixit of the expert\nagainst which the Supreme Court has warned.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3 (citing Gen.\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. l36, l46 (l999)).

Rocchio has\nnot and cannot point to a single study, controlled or otherwise, establishing the\nrepresentativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming behavior.

Again, Rocchio’s opinions “cannot be challenged\nor tested in any meaningful way.” See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.\n\nThere are other problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony. She opines, for example,\nthat “[iJndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted [through grooming] by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse,” Ex. l, p.2, but she doesn’t explain hou often. Half the time? Two-\nthirds of the time?

As reported by <span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span>,\nMr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.\nMaxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all\nin violation of subsections (l), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:\n\nThat’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who\n\nrepresents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused\n\nby Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her\n\ncredibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.\n\n‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying\n\nto blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so\n\ncontrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just\n\ngoing to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were\nrepresenting her.’\n\nBoies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if\n\nthere’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not\n\nto grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused\n\nme.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies\n\nsaid that Farmer was a l6-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met\n\nMaxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group\n\nof high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.\n\n‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are\n\nfraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®\n\n® htps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ghislaine-maxwell-may-play-the-victim-card-in-trial-\ndefense-l.l46563l\n\nApp.o35\nDOJ-OGR-oool9494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022296.jpg": "*Redactions for personal\ncontact information\n: Sevier a\n: Yea aes\nee ke\nites: ER Sea at ee etia pains Se Eo AT ar 3s at J Sens GNP ae be,\ngs Rice ae ieee Magee Fin. ie ve Siar ss\nSs amr ee\nPa ae ie bier Bre nle e ee a zs oe\ngabe hres Sb Bs oso sf eae Pa Ie BED oe ag Die shy The sees Pts pee pened ae Spee\n__ ofA SESE ESS i a ac ie RC a | psa tree Petey ee ARE\nP 3 7 e ARREARS sae RS Soe aS Re aot eth ae Bent SS ag On SOREN 77 ars Pediee Ge gua PaS\nf i by Bookis Nicholas\na B Ds\nee Peay Booth Mark & Lauren\n£4\n'*\niy <span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span> M\nq Boisgelin, Edward de\n4\ntad\n4 Socisguilbert, Pierre de tet\n4 Board antha Loo\na\nA Black\nBye ac ‘\n: a La\nie\n. 3 j fr Gicla\nHe 7 + “\nEb Bode Sophie Borrico, Michael\nit .\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023530.jpg": "Re:<span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span> reporter: Epstein\nFrom Lee Plourde\nto TT\nDate 2ol9/o8/lo l8:l7\nSubject: Re:<span class=\"highlight\">Bloomberg</span> reporter: Epstein\natachintates TEXT.htm, Press Release - MCC New\nYork.pdf\nPage l88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2353o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023531.jpg": "Good evening,\nPlease see the atached press release of an incident that occurred this morning August lo, 2ol9 at MCC\nNew York l5o Park Rou, NY looo7.
