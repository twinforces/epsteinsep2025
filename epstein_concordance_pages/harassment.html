Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee.

Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000399.jpg": "TasSecesb9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl8 - Filed o7/l6/l9 Pagel3 of l8 l3\n\nl negotiating that agreement, which again did not include the\n\n2 Southern District of New York.

And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court.

Despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell was not charged—indeed, not even\nmentioned—in the Epstein indictment, and had not been charged with any crimes, the\nauthors referred to her as a “crazy, pedophile, pimp, bitch” and a “subhuman c*nt,” and\ncalled for her to “rot in jail.” These people also encouraged all manner of violent acts\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001127.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAuNt DibeuMe/ntl £7o 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a cedgs Sf 2o45\nIndeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed.

Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll27", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001197.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdNt n DUE Gmeolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeageci A Ob l5\n(Gov.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter in response\nto the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2o2o, directing Ms. Maxwell to justify why her leter\nof the same date requesting an in camera conference to discuss confidentiality concerns related\nto her Renewed Motion for Release on Bail (the “Motion”) should be sealed or redacted.\n\nWe continue to believe that sealing the November 25, 2o2o leter (the “November 25\"\nLeter”) in its entirety is warranted and appropriate under the governing case law. Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse PF from\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are\nunprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to\nparticipate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and\npsychological wellbeing.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool984", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l8 of 45\nee It is very obvious that they love\nher deeply.

Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knous “in every\nfibre of [her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never try to flee.” (d.).\n\nSimilarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes:\n\nThis amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my\n\nhome fl If I lost these assets\n\nbecause Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be\n\nfinancially ruined.

Two other sureties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds\nin the amount of $25,ooo, and another will post $2,ooo in cash, which are significant\npledges for these individuals.\n\nIn addition to these bonds, the security company that will provide security services to\nMs. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $l million bond\nin support of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are\nnot aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a\ndefendant. The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this\nfor a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-\nstanding relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try\nto flee.” (Ex. S).\n\nIn sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her\nfamily and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live\nwithout constant media <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who\ndares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it\nshot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational\nslaughtering.”).

She also faced a deluge\nof threatening messages on social media in the days immediately follouing Epstein’s arrest\nand death. (See Ex. Q). The hatred directed touards Ms. Maxwell in these posts is palpable\nand unsetling. Despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell was not charged—indeed, not even\nmentioned—in the Epstein indictment, and had not been charged with any crimes, the\nauthors referred to her as a “crazy, pedophile, pimp, bitch” and a “subhuman c*nt,” and\ncalled for her to “rot in jail.” These people also encouraged all manner of violent acts\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool997", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 3l of 45\nIndeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.\nMaxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.\n\nIn sum, the cellphone clearly shous that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or\nthat she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 3l-32). She was trying to\nprotect herself as best as she could from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> by the press, not capture by law\nenforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions\nensure her presence at home in plain sight of f | (and the security guards), GPS-\nmonitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.\n\nD. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l2 of l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3438", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 276 of 348\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or specialist and other key officials.

Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 263 of 349\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 277 of 349\nservice providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or specialist and other key officials.

The\naftermath of this coverage resulted in the resignation of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, former\nU.S. Atorney of the Southern District of Florida, whose office was the subject of an inquiry\nconducted by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (““OPR’’)\nconcerning the federal criminal investigation of Epstein and its interactions with victims.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have.

Al-Sadawi,\n432 F.3d 4l9 (2d Cir. 2oo5) and Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3, to exclude evidence of Ms.\nMaxwell’s supposed “flight” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the\ngovernment from arguing to the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law\nenforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of, her arrest, or that her conduct during this time\nperiod is proof of consciousness of guilt.\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from\npublic view after Epstein’s arrest was emphatically not for the purpose of evading detection by\nlaw enforcement, but instead was an effort to protect herself and her family members from an\nonslaught of intrusive media atention and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s position\nwas extensively supported by leters from her spouse and other family members, who personally\natested to relentless <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> from the media, as well as an affidavit submited by Ms.\nMaxwell’s security guard who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.\nMaxwell remained in the United States continuously after Epstein’s arrest, was in regular contact\nwith the prosecutors through her atorneys, and never once demonstrated an intent to flee the\ncountry. The government has not established, and will not be able to establish at trial, a\nsufficient factual predicate of flight from which the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under\ncontrolling precedent. See Al-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424-25. Allouing the government to\nintroduce evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time of, her arrest to prove\nconsciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and would invite them to draw speculative and\nunsupported inferences in the face of contrary factual evidence. Such evidence and argument\nwould be unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and would lead to a mini trial on the issue of flight\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo569l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005692.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl4\nthat would confuse the issues in the case and cause undue delay. It should therefore be precluded\nunder Rule 4o3.\n\nBACKGROUD\nThe government repeatedly and erroneously argued in the context of Ms. Maxwell’s bail\napplications that Ms. Maxwell went into “hiding” follouing the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein to avoid\ndetection by law enforcement. See 7/2/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Supp. of Detention (Dkt. oo4) at 8\n(“[Ms. Maxwell] made intentional efforts to avoid detection”); 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in\nSupp. of Detention (Dkt. o22) at 8 (measures that Ms. Maxwell took “to conceal herself” after\nEpstein’s indictment “are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also\nsought to evade detection by law enforcement”); l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s\nRenewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant\nwas hiding not just from the press, but also from law enforcement.”). The government also\nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest\nevidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/l3/2o2o Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of\nDetention (Dkt. o22) at 7-8; 7/l4/2o2o Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 3l:2o-34:5; l2/l8/2o2o Gov’t Mem. in\nOpp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. loo) at 2l-22.\nThe government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which\nMs. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her\nfamily and friends from unrelenting <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> by the media and the very real danger of\nphysical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the follouing in its prior\nsubmissions:\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5692", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005693.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 388 Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl4\n\ne Ms. Maxwell moved residences and switched her primary phone\nnumber (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress. !\n\ne At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell allegedly ignored the\ndirection of FBI agents to open the front door of her residence and\ninstead moved into an interior room of the house.”\n\ne During a security sweep of the house, FBI agents found a cell phone\nwrapped in tin foil on top of a desk.?\n\nMs. Maxwell thoroughly rebuted each of these points in her second bail motion. See\nl2/l4/2o2o Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Renewed Mot. for Bail (Dkt. 97) at l8-25. Ms. Maxwell\noffered not just argument in response, but independent factual corroboration of her position that\nstands in direct opposition to the government’s incorrect and improper inferences. For example,\nMs. Maxwell provided a leter from her spouse, who confirmed that Ms. Maxwell’s decision to\nleave her family, move residences, and eventually setle in New Hampshire—where she\nremained continuously for over seven months until her arrest—was a difficult choice that was\nmotivated by the pressing need to protect herself and her family from media intrusion and\npotential violent threats, not by a desire to evade law enforcement. See id., Ex. A JJ 8-l2; see\nalso id., Ex. B at 2-4. Leters provided by other friends and family members atested to the\nrelentless media <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> they themselves received and the severe consequences they endured\nsimply for being associated with Ms. Maxwell. See, e.g., id., Exs.

A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v.

Because of the explicit nature of the offense conduct, which may require\nvictims to testify about “degrading and humiliating treatment,” revealing victim identities\n“would likely cause . . . anxiety and risk social stigma,” and “could chill the willingness of other\nalleged victims of sex crimes to come forward.” Order at 2, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK)\n(E.D.N.Y.

These interests significantly outweigh any defense interest, especially where\nthe defense knous the true identities of victims and is able to mount their defense. See id.; Order\nat 2-3, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No. 34.7\n\nIndeed, in two recent highly publicized cases in the Eastern District of New York, the\ndistrict court judges permited victims to testify using pseudonyms or using only their first\nnames. In United States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (E.D.N.Y.), the Government moved to allou\ntestifying victims to testify “under a nickname, first name, or pseudonym only, and to not be\nrequired to disclose uniquely identifying information,” such as “addresses, names of family\nmembers, or exact places of education or employment.” Order at 29, 32, Raniere, No. l8 Cr.\n2o4 (E.D.N.Y. May 6, 2ol9), Dkt. No. 622. The Court granted the motion, explaining that\n“requiring victims of sex trafficking . . . and other crimes to provide their names in public could\nchill their willingness to testify,” and “would only cause further embarrassment and humiliation,\ngiven the inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged.” Jd. at 32, 35 (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited). It also may “cause other victims to fear seeking help from law\nenforcement as that could subject them to further <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and embarrassment.” /d. (citation\nand internal quotation marks omited). Although the defendant claimed that several victims’\n2 Sex abuse cases are not unique. In other contexts, courts have permited the Government to\ncall witnesses using pseudonyms or using their first names only, notwithstanding a defendant’s\nSixth Amendment rights. See, e.g., United States v. Schulte, 436 F. Supp. 3d 698, 7o6 (S.D.N.Y.\n2o2o) (permiting use of pseudonyms in national security case); United States v. Hernandez, l2\nCr. 8o9 (PKC), 2ol3 WL 3936l85, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

Publicizing their names will subject them to unwanted atention at the time they\nare testifying in a criminal sex abuse trial.‘\n\nTaken together, requiring the Minor Victims to testify under their true and full names\nimposes serious costs on them. It is inconsistent with the Crime Victims’ Rights Act’s\nexhortation that victims are to be treated with respect for their “dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(a)(8). And requiring victims of sex crimes to provide their names in public could chill\ntheir willingness to testify, for fear of having their personal histories publicized as they rebuild\ntheir lives. See Order at 2, Martinez, No. l7 Cr. 28l (ERK) (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7), Dkt. No.\n34. It could also cause other victims—including minors—to avoid seeking help from law\nenforcement because of fear that coming forward could subject them to further <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and\nembarrassment. Cf Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 Advisory Commitee Note (explaining that, by protecting\nthe victim “against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that\nis associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details,” the rule “encourages victims of\nsexual misconduct to . . . participate in legal proceedings against alleged offenders”).\n\n* The Government would consent to an appropriate jury instruction explaining that the reason for\nthe precautions is “regard for the witnesses’ and non-witness victims’ privacy,” and that no\ninference should be drawn against the defendant because of those precautions. Order at 33-34,\nUnited States v. Raniere (E.D.N.Y. May 6, 2ol9), Dkt. No. 622 (“[T]he court is confident that\nany prejudice can be cured with a jury instruction explaining that the reason for the anonymity is\nregard for the witnesses’ and non-witness victims’ privacy.”); Apr. 5, 2ol6 Tr. at 9-lo, United\nStates v. Quraishi (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 5, 2ol6), Dkt. No. 46. As the district court in the Raniere case\nexplained, “[g]iven the potentially embarrassing nature of the allegations, and the media\natention thus far, such an explanation will certainly seem plausible to the jury.” Order at 34,\nUnited States v.

The Government’s sealing request is\nnarrouly tailored to prevent public disclosure only of those exhibits which would identify by\nname the Minor Victims testifying in this case.

(Def. Mot.\nAtachment A). The subpoena should be quashed as to each of these categories.?\n\nA. Payment Records\n\nThe first category—copies of payments made to the Minor Victims—concerns information\nalready in the defendant’s possession. Indeed, the defendant’s motion cites the amounts received\nby the Minor Victims, which is reflected in their 35oo material (Def. Mot. at 3), and the\nGovernment expects the Minor Victims to testify to those amounts at trial.\n\nAccordingly, this information is “otherwise procurable.” United States v. Pena, No. l5 Cr.\n55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). The subpoena should therefore\nbe quashed. At most, the Court should order production of that information to the Court so that it\nmay be provided to the defense in the unlikely event that the Minor Victims testify inconsistently\nwith their prior statements at trial.\n\nB. Claim Release Forms\n\nThe defendant makes no argument for the relevance of the release forms executed by the\nMinor Victims, and none is apparent to the Government. The Court should therefore quash the\nsubpoena insofar as it calls for that category of information, at least until the defendant explains\nwhat relevant and admissible evidence is contained in the release forms.\n3 The Government has standing to challenge the subpoena because it targets information about\nanticipated Government witnesses, “based on the Government’s ‘interest in preventing any undue\nlengthening of the trial, any undue <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> of the witness and [her] family, and any prejudicial\nover-emphasis on the witness’s credibility.’” United States v.

The\ngovernment cannot meet this minimal threshold here.\n\nMs. Maxwell respectfully suggests that this issue cannot be resolved by the Court without\nconsideration of the evidence and the witness through whom the government will atempt\nSouthern District of Florida for a $l.2 billion Ponzi scheme, involving falsifying documents,\nincluding police reports and court pleadings, specifically against Epstein; blackmailing targeted\ndefendants to setle false allegations of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and abuse; and devising an investment\nscheme involving pre-trial funding in the guise of structured setlements.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\nharmed by conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy—and she was—then she is a “victim” under\nthe relevant statutes.\n\nFinally, Minor Victim-3 is also a “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2,\nbecause she is clearly someone who “can reasonably be characterized as a ‘victim of alleged sexual\nmisconduct.’” Fed.

Given Rule 4l2’s broad\napplication in not just criminal cases but also civil cases such as claims of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, see\nWolak v.

As set\nforth above, Epstein’s conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual\nmisconduct,” and therefore she is a victim as defined in Rule 4l2.\n\nFor these reasons, Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under the provisions of federal law\ndiscussed above. Moreover, the Government respectfully submits that even if its reading of these\nprovisions is incorrect, that does not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as\ndirect evidence: evidence that does not itself establish every element of the charged crime may\nnevertheless be admissible as direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l,\n942 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo).

The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v.

Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were necessary to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to publicity, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the disclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\nsensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are anticipated to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research. It appears, then, that the Defense’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548 _ Filed l2/l5/2l Page3of6\nrequested relief is unprecedented.\n\nThe Defense raises several specific arguments in favor of its unprecedented request.\nFirst, the Defense argues that anonymity is necessary to protect its witnesses from scrutiny and\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> because of the significant publicity this case has garnered. But these generalized\nconcerns are present in every high-profile criminal case. They do not present the rare\ncircumstances that prior courts have found justify the use of pseudonyms. Further, the alleged\nvictims that received pseudonyms during the Government’s case have a statutory right to have\ntheir “dignity and privacy” protected. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(8). The Defense’s witnesses have no\nsimilar right.\n\nPerhaps most analogous to Defendant’s request is United States v. Rainiere, United States\nv. Rainiere, No. l8-CR-2o4Sl (NGG), 2o2l WL 4522298 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2o2l), another\nhigh-profile case involving alleged sexual misconduct. There, after a defendant pled guilty, the\ndefense sought to keep leters submited in support of the defendant at sentencing anonymous,\narguing that anonymity was necessary because “the authors of supportive leters may face\nretribution if their identities are publicly knoun, given the public atention that has been paid to\nthis case” and that failure to do so “will have a chilling effect on individuals who wish to speak\nin support of defendants in other high-profile prosecutions.” /d. at *3-4. The court\nacknouledged the individuals’ “genuine interest in assisting sentencing while remaining out of\nthe public eye themselves,” but concluded that their leters about the defendant did “not involve\ntraditionally private maters” and that the public’s interest in access prevailed. /d. at *4. The\nCourt concludes that the same analysis applies here.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, the Defense argues that without pseudonyms, its witnesses may\nrefuse to testify, implicating Ms. Maxwell’s right to present a defense. The Court notes the late-\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of6\n\nFourth, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for one witness because, under\nthe Government’s theory of the case, she is a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. There are at\nleast two problems with this justification. First, based on the Defense’s current explanation of\nthis witness’s anticipated testimony, this witness will testify that she was not the target of any\nsexual misconduct by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. She would therefore fall outside the scope of the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, which defines a victim as “a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Though the\nAct’s definition of victim is “expansive,” the Defense has not identified a way in which this\nwitness was harmed, “whether physically, financially, psychologically, or otherwise” by an\noffense allegedly commited by Ms. Maxwell. United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also In re Ippolito, 8ll F. App’x 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (“[O]ne does not\nacquire status under the CVRA based on his oun say-so.”). Second, and relatedly, the Court\nunderstands that this witness will testify that sexual conduct did not occur. Consequently, the\ntestimony does not raise the same risks of embarrassment or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> as did the other\nwitnesses’ testimony, nor does it risk deterring alleged victims of sexual abuse from coming\nforward in future cases. The Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting testimony under a\npseudonym.\n\nThe Defense’s fifth argument is that the Court permited two non-alleged victims to\ntestify under pseudonyms, which justifies permiting its witnesses to do the same. But as the\nCourt explained, it permited two non-victims to testify under pseudonym only “because the\ndisclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.” Nov.\nl Tr. at 8. The Defense has not identified any similar dynamic here.\n\nLast, the Court emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense’s motion, the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 _ Filed o2/l6/22 Page 2of3\n\nPage 2\nfor public access to those questionnaires. Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl3\nF3d 76, 79 (2d Cir l998) (Citing United States v.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page9of49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the questionnaire that might make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def.

Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing discovery”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 4o4 (D. Vt. l998) (“All of the jurors were\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\n2. The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.!°\nl4 Tn particular, Juror 5o cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\nl5 For the reasons discussed above,\n\nSimilarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l62", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6 Filed o2/24/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly understood and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit.

That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nOO eeeSC——\nee\nee\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were convicted, in contravention of the Sixth\nAmendment and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, xa\nRes conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Rather, “[a]llegations of\nimpropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and\nrelevant evidence.’” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o,\n543 (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard. Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2o22, at 8\nn.4. But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard. And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9547", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 5o’s description of his social\nmedia accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” /d. The threshold for a\nhearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into\nJuror 5o’s social media usage. Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582\nF.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)).\n\nD. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Page2of4\nPage 2\nl. Whether Juror 5o Accurately Answered Questions 25 and 48\nFirst, the Court should ask Juror 5o to answer Questions 25 and 48, to determine what the\naccurate answers are:\n\n¢ Question 48: Have you ora friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?\n\ne Question 48(a) asks the juror to “please explain.” Consistent with the Court’s\npractice at voir dire, the Government submits that the Court should ask Juror 5o\nwhether he feels comfortable explaining in open court what happened to him, or\nwhether he would prefer to do so at sidebar. The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\nassault, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433\nF.3d 273, 3o4 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\n¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim\nof a crime? The Government respectfully notes that unlike Question 48 of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009636.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Page3of4\nPage 3\nwriten questionnaire, Question 25 did not ask prospective jurors to elaborate, but\nsimply asked whether they could be fair and impartial.\nI. Juror 5o’s Explanation For His Answers to Questions 25 and 48\nThe Government submits that the Court should then direct Juror 5o to the questionnaire he\ncompleted, and ask the follouing questions:\ne Was your answer to Question 48 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 48?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 48 inaccurately?\ne Was your answer to Question 25 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 25?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 25 inaccurately?\nWil. Hou Juror 5o Would Have Responded to Follou Up Questions to Questions\n25 and 48\nConsistent with the Court’s questioning of jurors who disclosed during voir dire that they\nhad experienced sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, the Government submits that\nthe Court should ask Juror 5o whether his experiences affected his ability to be fair and impartial.\nHouever, the Court should be mindful of Rule 6o6(b), which precludes the Court from inquiring\ninto the substance of the jury’s deliberations or Juror 5o’s mental processes as a juror.\nAccordingly, the Government submits the follouing questions are appropriate:\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to be fair and impartial\nin this case?\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to render a verdict\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9636", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page5of22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Court denied\nthe defense's request.\n\nJuror No. 5o appeared for his voir dire on November l6. Because Juror No. 5o\nanswered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just\nseven pages of transcript. TR ll/6/2o2l, pp l28-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask\nJuror No. 5o whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set\naside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.\nMaxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.\n\nAs to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal\nbackground), Juror No. 5o was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror\nNo. 5o if he used social media. Juror No. 5o said that he recently ended a relationship so\nhe “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght nou.” TR ll/l6/2o2l, p l33. Asked “[w]hat\ndo you use, Facebook, Twiter,” Juror No. 5o answered, “I used Facebook and\nInstagram,” but he did not mention any Twiter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.\n5o said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.\n\nIn fact, as described belou, Juror No. 5o had a Twiter account (created in April\n2o2l) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he\ngave follouing this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l5 of 66\n\nIt also appears that Juror No. 5o did not delete his Instagram account, despite what\nhe told the Court, since he posted about his jury service after the verdict was returned.\n\nAt the end of the very brief voir dire examination, the Court asked Juror No. 5o if\nhe had “[a]ny doubt about [his] ability to” be fair to both sides. /d. at l34. Juror No. 5o\nsaid, “no.” /d. The Court concluded: “Other than what I have asked you, do you have any\nreason to think that you can’t be fair and impartial here?” /d. Juror No. 5o responded, “I\ndo not.” Id.\n\nThe Court inquired whether the parties had any follou-up questions. Because\nJuror No. 5o denied any bias or inability to be fair and impartial, and because his answers\nto the questionnaire did not raise any red flags about his ability to serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror in a case involving alleged sexual assault and sexual abuse, Ms.\nMaxwell’s atorneys did not propose any follou-up questions.\n\nThe lack of follou-up questions for Juror No. 5o contrasts with other jurors who\nhonestly disclosed their history as victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.

Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4.

While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.!

(Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.” (Def.

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 49\noriginal). “The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether leting a guilty verdict stand would\nbe a manifest injustice.” Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nCourts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquiries into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court\nexplained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first\ntime . . . after the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank\ndiscussion in the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the\ncommunity’s trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined\nby a barrage of post-verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” Yanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7,\nl2o-2l (l987) (citations omited). The Second Circuit has cautioned that “post-verdict inquiries\nmay lead to evil consequences: subjecting juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, inhibiting juryroom deliberation,\nburdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating\nuncertainty in jury verdicts.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543.\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,\n464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The Second Circuit has held that these two requirements are\nconjunctive: “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou both that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis for the defendant to\nchallenge the juror for cause.” Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (emphasis in original). The first prong\nrequires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also Part II.B.l.a, infra. The\nsecond prong requires the Court to determine whether, if the juror had answered truthfully, it would\nhave granted a hypothetical strike for cause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4 (2d\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the prospective jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9827", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\nprecision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo983o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror questionnaire. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo983l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 34 of 49\n48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately\nresponded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Government submits that: (l) the Court should conduct\nthe questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 5o should be narrouly tailored; (3) there is no basis to\ncall any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing discovery”\nshould be denied.\n\nl. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning\n\nFirst, as noted, given the dangers of <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and embarrassment presented by juror\ninquiries, the Court has the pouer and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—\nand courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the\nparties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,\n82l F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that\nthe district court “wisely refrained from allouing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary\nhearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d l78,\nl9l (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which\nthe parties may participate therein are maters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);\nChase Manhatan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), l997 WL 22l2o3, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 28, l997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both\nparties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the\njuror from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the\njuror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (district court examined\njuror in camera, after permiting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.\nl989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 4o4 (D. Vt. l998) (“All of the jurors were\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\nDn The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.'4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.’\n\n‘4 Tn particular, Juror SO cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\n'S For the reasons discussed above, the defendant has not met her burden with respect to Juror 5o’s\nvoir dire statements about his social media use and accordingly a hearing regarding such\nstatements is not warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial. And\nRequest l(d) calls for communications about any payment Juror 5o received for media interviews,\nbut even if he received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about\nwhether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial based on his alleged experience\nwith sexual abuse.\n\nRequests 2(a) and 2(b) ask the Court to direct numerous social media companies to produce\nall communications to and from Juror 5o about his jury service and all posts or comments regarding\n4]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo984l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8 of 32\nfor turning a blind eye to Juror No. 5o’s misconduct and the constitutional right to a fair and\nimpartial jury, and it then proposes a superficial inquiry that would make it all but impossible for\nMs. Maxwell to meet the erroneously high burden the government asks this Court to apply.\n\nYet this Court has “an unflagging duty . . . to investigate [Ms. Maxwell’s] claim.””\nProperly understood and properly considered, Ms. Maxwell’s claim has evident merit. For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nThose potential jurors admited to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged\nconduct in this case. For example, potential jurors said they were groped or harassed on the\nsubway, harassed at work, or touched inappropriately in a social seting. Resp. at 4-5.\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying disclosure, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v. French, 9o4 F.3d ll, ll7 (lst Cir. 2ol8) (quotation omited).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9877", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of32\nte OK ok\n\nThis is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their\nclaimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be\n\na summary voir dire; it will be probing. . . . Ifa juror’s going to lie and be dishonest,\n\nwe will smoke that out.\n\nTr. lo/2l/2l Hrg. at 26:l2.\n\nAlthough given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual\nabuse, Juror No. 5o failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as “were\nyou the victim of a crime” and specifically, whether\n\nHave you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page ll of 32\nchildhood sexual abuse; and (3) had he answered the questions accurately he would have been\nchallenged for cause and disqualified.\n\nThe Law\nI. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA. The government’s policy concerns—the abstract interest in “finality”\nand the so-called “disfavor” with which new trial motions are viewed—\nare misplaced.\n\nThe government’s response is conspicuous in that it does not begin with the law\ngoverning new trial motions based on juror bias. Instead, the government sets the table with\nappeals to “finality,” statements that new trial motions are “disfavored,” and implications that\ncourts should turn a blind eye to juror misconduct because to do otherwise would expose jurors\nto <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation. Resp. at lo-ll. None of these concerns has any purchase here.\n\nIn the government’s view, the jury in this case “finally” determined Ms. Maxwell’s guilt.\nTo be entitled to a new trial, says the government, “a district court must find that there is ‘a real\nconcern that an innocent person may have been convicted.’” Resp. at lo (quoting United States\nv. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d\nl29, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool))). That is not correct.\n\nEveryone accused of a crime is entitled a trial by a fair trial and impartial jury. U.S.\nConst. amends. V, VI. That constitutional promise demands twelve fair and impartial jurors.\nParker, 385 U.S. at 366. “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause”\nis structural error and it “require[s] reversal.” Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; United States v.\nNelson, 277 F.3d l64, 2o4 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“[T]he empanelment of a jury on which [a] biased\njuror sat [means that] the defendants in this case were convicted, in contravention of the Sixth\nAmendment and due process, by a jury that cannot be deemed to have been fully impartial.”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 32\nMs. Maxwell is not required to shou prejudice, nor must the Court have “a real concern that an\ninnocent person may have been convicted” before a new trial is required. The government’s\ncontrary contention is specious.\n\nThe government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new\ntrial motions with “disfavor.” Resp. at ll. These cases, warn the government, counsel against\n“inquiries into juror conduct.” /d. Quoting Tanner v. United States, the government says:\n“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inatentiveness, raised for the first time. . .\nafter the verdict, seriously disrupt the finality of the process. Moreover, full and frank discussion\nin the jury room, jurors’ willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community’s trust in\na system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-\nverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, l2o-2l\n(l987)). The government also quotes the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Ianniello,\nin which the Court said that “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences: subjecting\njuries to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\n866 F.2d 54o, 534 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n> The government draws the “real concern” language from cases addressing new trial\nmotions based on the conduct of the trial itself—e.g., the admissibility or truthfulness of\ntestimony of witnesses, McCourty, 562 F.3d at 475, or the quality and sufficiency of the\nevidence, Ferguson, 246 F.3d at l34.\n\nThe cases cited by the government do not address the fundamental right to trial by an\nimpartial jury, and they do not undermine the blackleter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial\nrights that ‘can never be treated as harmless’ is a defendant’s ‘right to an impartial adjudicator,\nbe it judge or jury.’” Gomez v. United States, 49o U.S. 858, 876 (l989) (quoting Gray v.\nMississippi, 48l U.S. 648, 668 (l987)).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo988l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l3 of 32\n\nThe government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both\ncases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in\n“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at ll9, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866\nF.2d at 543.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, there is at least one juror who falsely answered voir dire\nquestions to gain a seat on the jury, conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance\nof courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into hou the jury reached its decision\nsimply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.\n\nIn fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second\nCircuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations\nby ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial\njury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)).*\nHere, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks\nexposing Juror No. 5o to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.\nMaxwell knous of Juror No. 5o’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 5o has sought\nout the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has alloued himself to be\nvideotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated\n\n* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new\ntrial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations.

Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen questionnaire, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2). The questionnaire\nand the process by which Juror 5o completed the questionnaire “must be viewed in context.”\nUnited States v. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2 (WKS), 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the questionnaire on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\nquestionnaire was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 8 ofl6\n“crime” did not prompt Juror 5o to disclose his experience of childhood sexual abuse, which was\nnot criminally prosecuted, on his questionnaire. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an inaccurate answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\nquestionnaire cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document. See McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555; Dyer, l5l F.3d at 973. Juror 5o’s answer to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l2 of l6\n\nhis ability to render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial and the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with prior sexual\nabuse interfere with his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. (/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s expectations about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l5 ofl6\nthe victims in this case—rather, it is quite different. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 8:l4-2o (stating that he\nwas abused at age nine or ten by a family member, and that he disclosed the abuse in high school)).\n\nThere is also no basis in the record for the defendant’s request that the Court infer bias on\nthe part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 37-38). Juror 5o’s testimony does not “permit an\ninference that [he] would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\nInstead, Juror 5o repeatedly testified that he would be fair and impartial and decide the case based\non the evidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. See id. at 47 n.l2 (“particularly\nwhen considering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable\nbias,” judge may be “persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance”). Just as the Court properly\nelected to not exercise its discretion to infer bias where prospective jurors disclosed during voir\ndire that they had been victims of sexual abuse or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, so too should the Court decline to\nmake a finding of inferred bias on the part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 29-3o). Such a finding\nis without any support in the record.\n\nThe testimony given by Juror 5o, under oath, makes clear that he was a fair and impartial\njuror. Because the defendant cannot establish either prong of the McDonough test, let alone both,\nher motion for a new trial is meritless and should be denied.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page2ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page5of4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\nprospective juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, and assault.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” Jd. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the prospective juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted sexual assault or other\n\nunwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or\n\nfamily member).\nId. at 24. Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),”\n“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing\nnames, please explain.” Space was provided to write an answer. Question 48b asked: “If your\nanswer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in this case?” There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.” Finally,\nQuestion 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.” Like Question 48a, several lines of space\nwere provided to answer the question. /d.\n\nFinally, Question 49 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault?

Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” Jd. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nId. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these prospective jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the prospective juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause.

Touting RRA as the “preeminent sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> firm in the country,”\nRothstein claimed to be representing numerous underage girls who had been involved with Epstein.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020026.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT D2 FileebBA3A/ Pag Page a226lo45\n\nwas arrested and has shoun no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined.

And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic.

Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could Not Seek\n\nRefuge in the United Kingdom or France\n\nAt the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States for almost 3o years, might flee to the United Kingdom or\nFrance if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after\nEpstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not\nextradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the\ngovernment represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a\nmater of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by\nthe United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the\nextradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.\nMaxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom\nand France.\n\nAs we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would\natempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive\nand opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020115.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o88GlAUNnt Decne lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2t gPagetl 2osf l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s intention to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021438.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 962 3536o39, Page8 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*®° Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”3°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”\"°° Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims.

Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49-\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the juror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice.

See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.jpg": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°?

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024711.jpg": "Page 72\nA .\nForm 583 Report of Incident\nIncident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: Date/Time Of Incident: 7/23/2ol9 l:27 AM\noo76\nSection l: General Information\n\nStaff Aware Date: 7/23/2ol9 l:27 AM\nFBI Notified: No USMS Notified: No Indicate Where Incident Occurred: Main Facility\nLocation Level l: SHU Level 2: Housing Unit, Special (SHU) Level 3: 9 SOUTH SHU\nTypeOfincident: Institution Locked Doun: No\n5 Assault On Inmate Modified Operations: No\n\nAssault On Staff\n\nCause Of Incident Knoun?

There is :\nabsolutely no basis in the record to indicate that Epstein will act other than properly and with the |\nproper decorum at the depositions of the Plaintiffs and abide in all respects with the No-Contact |\nOrder. |\nWherefore, Epstein respectfully requests that this Court enter an order denying Plaintiffs’ |\n. Motion for Protective Order, provide that Epstein is permited to atend the depositions of the .\nPlaintiffs that have asserted claims against him in the related maters, and for such other and |\n7 further relief as this court deems just and propez. :\nMichael J.

Count Five\ncharged Maxwell with sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of\nl8 U.S.C. § 37l.

Finding Juror 5o’s testimony to be\ncredible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion\nfor a new trial in a writen order.\n\nMaxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of\n24o months’ imprisonment to be folloued by five years’\nsupervised release, and the District Court imposed a\n$75o,ooo fine and a $3oo mandatory special assessment.\nThis appeal folloued.\n\n° Question 2 asked “[hlave you, or any of your relatives or close\nfriends, ever been a victim of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[hlave\nyou or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n<span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes\nactual or atempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual\nadvance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked\n\n[hJave you or a friend or family member ever been\naccused of sexual <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, sexual abuse, or sexual\nassault?

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span> to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ .. . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023274.tif": "civil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense <span class=\"highlight\">harassment</span>, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally identified crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then identified only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n366 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n368 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23274", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023288.tif": "service providers, and lists the names and telephone numbers of the victim-witness\ncoordinator or specialist and other key officials.
