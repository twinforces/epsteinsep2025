The government’s argument that Mr. Epstein’s release would risk obstructive\nbehavior, at pages 8-9 of its submission, rests primarily upon statements made between Mr.\nEpstein’s prior counsel and an Assistant U.S. Atorney while they searched for a federal offense,\nat the government’s behest, with a one-year statutory maximum or guideline during the give-and-\ntake of those of plea negotiations. The communication from prior counsel about a potential\nproffer for a federal charge was met with the response that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncharge such an offense. These purported facts were mere allegations that did not ultimately\nmanifest themselves in any agreement by Mr. Epstein — nor in any agreement that probable cause\nexisted to support any obstruction or assault charge. And the documents from the Southern\nDistrict of Florida litigation referenced by the government in support of its argument on this\npoint expressly acknouledge this lack of substantiation.

In\nshort, these were suggested hypotheses not facts, and the government itself ultimately did not\nbelieve there was factual support for the allegations. They do not provide a sufficiently reliable\nfactual basis for any finding by clear and convincing evidence. As to the suggestion by the\nprosecutor that a charge could be predicated on a prior incident where it was alleged that an\ninvestigator forced a family member of a witness off the road, the defense is without knouledge\nas to the basis for this allegation and the conduct, if it occurred, was not atributable to or\nauthorized by Mr. Epstein.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000283.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page lo of l6\n\nTo reiterate, the Bail Reform Act requires pretrial release on the “/east restrictive”\nconditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)\n(emphasis added).

L. No. lo6-386, ll4 Stat. l464 (October 28, 2ooo).

Evans, 476 F.3d ll76, ll79 (llth Cir. 2oo7). Importantly, “the entire language and\ndesign of the statute as a whole indicates that it is meant to punish those who are the providers or\npimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.” Fierro v.

In Fierro, the district court\nfound § l59l inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of sex acts. Here, the principal conduct\nunderlying the indictment is Mr. Epstein’s payment of money for massages that purportedly\nescalated to alleged sex acts. Mr. Epstein’s conduct, houever, is akin to consumer or purchaser\nbehavior and should be outside the ambit of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. See Fierro, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o,\nat *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers of sex from trafficking\nvictims...”).!°\n‘o While Fiero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein notes that there is a division of\nauthority on the scope of § l59l. See United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66, lo68 (8th Cir.\n2ol3).

It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater.

In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000447.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 24 _ Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 3of9\nHon.

Such a construction turns the statute’s\nplain text — expressly providing that the presumption is “[s]ubject to\nrebutal,” and otherwise mandating bail on the “least restrictive”\nconditions that reasonably assure the defendant’s presence and\ncommunity safety — on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the\npresumption of innocence.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79\n(2d Cir. l99o), there should be no similar <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for those third parties accused of wrongdoing.\n\n3s 2K 3\n\nMs. Farmer strongly supports the release of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts,\nsubject to appropriate redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000774.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\nHonorable Richard M.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

With regard to the Austrian\npassport, the Defense explains that “Epstein . . . acquired the passport in the l98os, when\nhijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in the event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers,\nhijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur.” Dkt. 24 at 8.

But the defendant’s possession of what purports to be a\nforeign passport issued under an alias gives rise to the inference the defendant knous hou to\nobtain false travel documents and/or assume other, foreign identities. This adds to the serious |\nrisk of flight posed by the defendant.”). The Government also argues that “the passport contains |\nnumerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter |\nFrance, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the l98os.” Dkt. 3o. By submission\ndated July l8, 2ol9, the Defense explains: “Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend . . |\n. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any immigration :\nor customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect\nMr. Epstein’s entries or exits.” Dkt. 3l.\nDefense counsel has submited a one page document called “Asset Summary - June 3o,\n2ol9.” It indicates that Epstein has cash in the amount of $56,547,773; fixed income valued at\n|\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo8o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000811.jpg": "Cas&’4S£ol4-4648o-RMEDbeuMenPsH | Piles OV l82 gFAGeS OF 33 |\nincorporated here by reference.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French nationality, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request.

Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29 Filed o7/27/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nDOJ-OGR-ooool645\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page ll of l3\n\nc) Shall be reviewed by the Defendant solely in\nthe presence of Defense Counsel;\n\nd) Shall not be possessed outside the presence\nof Defense Counsel, or maintained, by the Defendant;\n\ne) Shall be made available for inspection by\nDefense Counsel and the Defendant, under the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of law\nenforcement officers or employees; and\n\n£) Shall not be copied or otherwise duplicated\nby Defense Counsel or the Defendant during such inspections.\n\nl6.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

United States, 4l8 U.S. 87, ll7 (l974) (“[A]n indictment is sufficient if it,\nfirst, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge\nagainst which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquital or conviction in bar\nof future prosecutions for the same offense.”); Fed.R.Crim.P.7(c). An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no identified witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 68 Filed ll/o5/2o Page l of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nween nee nn eee K\nIN RE: FEDERAL RULE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE 5(F) | ORDER\nALISON J.

For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim.

We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time.

Houever, in\nresponse to the Court’s order, we ask the Court to file a redacted version of the November 25\nLeter, atached hereto as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect\nthird parties from threats and harassment. In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly identified by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

(See November 25\" Leter at 3). The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l\nF.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should\nweigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes.

(granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits\non privacy grounds). Ultimately, we seek the same privacy protections for these people that the\ngovernment has sought and obtained for Ms. Maxwell’s accusers and for other information\ncovered by the Protective Order in this case.\n\nBy making this request for redaction, we are not trying to litigate this case in secret. We\nare merely seeking the ability to file a renewed bail application for Ms. Maxwell without further\nrisking the safety and privacy of sureties needed to support that application. This is the first of\nseveral confidentiality issues that will arise in connection with the Motion, and the sureties will\nbe looking at the Court’s ruling as an indication of the level of confidentiality they can expect to\nbe afforded. These individuals have requested that their privacy and safety be appropriately\nprotected by the Court.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court file the proposed\nredacted version of the November 25\" Leter, atached as Exhibit A, and the proposed redacted\nversion of this leter, atached as Exhibit B. In the alternative, we request leave to withdraw both\nleters and refile the November 25™ Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page l of 4\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP l2l2 987 76oo phone\nwww.cohen gresser.com\n; USDCSDNY—t™\nMaks oe ” DOCUMENT\npape ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nmcohen@cohengresser.com aia pt, a\nceverdell@cohengresser.com DATE Ficep:_l2/7/2o___\nNovember 25, 2o2o\nTO BE FILED UNDER SEAL\nVIA EMAIL (SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 2(B)\nOF JUDGE NATHAN’S INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL CASES)\nThe Honorable Alison J.

For the reasons explained belou, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crm. P.\n49.l(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting\nmaterials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an\nin camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other\nconfidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the\ngovernment, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting\nthat sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those\nthat the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.\n\nIn the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request for bail and granted the\ngovernment’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial\ninformation that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive\nbail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly,\nMs. Maxwell nou seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if\nmade public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including:\n\n¢ Leters from Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close friends, who have agreed to\n\nserve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application.

Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States\nThe extradition arrangements\n\n3.

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this designation is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom. The Act applies in the three\njurisdictions within the United Kingdom: (a) England and Wales; (b) Scotland; and (c) Northern Ireland.

Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The test is\nwhether substantial grounds have been shoun that, if extradited, the person faces a “real risk” of\ntreatment contrary to Article 3°°. The test is a stringent one and a strong case is required to make\ngood a violation of Article 3°’. Mistreatment must atain a minimum level of severity before Article 3\nis engaged. Prison conditions can meet that test although, whether they do, depends on all the\ncircumstances, including the personal characteristics of the detainee”’. Although Article 3 complaints\nbased on prison conditions are not uncommon in US cases, the courts have repeatedly rejected such\nsubmissions” ’”. Further, even if there were to be a case where the systemic conditions at one or more\nUS detention facilities were found to give rise to a serious risk that Article 3 would be breached by\nextradition, such difficulties are capable of being surmounted by the provision of assurances that the\nrequested person will not be detained in those particular prisons, or by giving guarantees in relation to\n\n*° Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 87.\n*7 There does not appear to be any basis upon which it could be said that the follouing rights are engaged: (a) Art. 2 (the\nright to life); (b) Art. 4 (freedom from slavery); (c) Art. 5 (unlawful detention); Art. 7 (no punishment without law); Art.\n9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion); Art. lo (freedom of speech); Art. ll (freedom of assembly); Art. l2 (the\nright to marry); Art. l4 (discrimination); Arts. l-3 of the First Protocol (<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of property; right to education; right to\nfree elections); and Art. l of the Thirteenth Protocol (abolition of the death penalty).\n88 Soering v United Kingdom (l989) ll EHRR 439, paras. 88 and 9l.\n*° Elashmawy v Court of Brescia, Italy and Ors [2ol5] EWHC 28 (Admin), para. 49.\n°° Ireland v United Kingdom (l979-8o) 2 EHRR 25, para. l62.\n*!

Fourth stage: Decision of the Investigating Chamber of the competent Court of\n\nappeal\n\nl8. Once the requested person has declared to the Prosecutor General whether he consents\nor not to extradition, the Investigating Chamber is immediately seized of the case.

The same provision states that the\nrequested person may also decide to waive the rule of specialty before the Prosecutor\nGeneral.\n\n2o.

In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmited by the USA against Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she\nhas to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms\nand conditions in this requesting State.\n\n34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part\nof this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the\nperson of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee\nfrom the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then\nanalyze the status of the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of nationals from extradition in the French legal\nsystem and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude\nthat Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally\nbarred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and\nunique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an\nextradition decree.\n\nA. General bars to extradition\n\n35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (l)\na claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the\nrequesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from\ntorture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (ll) the dual criminality rule; and (i) a claim\nthat the extradition request is politically motivated.\n\n(i) Human rights bars\n\n36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the\nCourt of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the\nconditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the\nright to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane\n\n5 Cass. Crim., 26 March 2ol9, nNo. l9-8l73l.\nl6 Einhorn v.

Article 4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that\n“le]xtradition shall not be granted by France when the offense for which extradition is\nrequested is considered by France as a political offense or as an offense connected with\na political offense or as an offense inspired by political motives”.\n\n48. A political motivation claim requires the Investigating Chamber to examine, to some\nextent, the merits of the case. The Court is also required to look into the merits of the\ncase where the requested person argues that there is a manifest inconsistency between\nthe conduct and the legal offenses in respect of which the extradition is sought’.\n\n49. The conduct described in the indictment does not appear to be manifestly inconsistent\nwith the offenses charged therein.\n\n5o. As to political motivation, French courts have never opposed extradition requests from\nthe USA on this ground‘, In fact, in the past ten years, only one published decision of\nthe Cour de cassation has denied an American extradition request, on the ground that\nthe Investigating Chamber had not verified that the criminal conduct described in the\nrequest constituted a crime in France at the time of commission”. All other published\ndecisions which have ruled on a request from the USA have granted extradition”®.\n\n5l. In light of the elements contained in the Superseding Indictment, Ms Ghislaine Maxwell\ncould not oppose her extradition to the USA on the basis of a political motivation claim,\nthat would have no serious ground, and therefore the Investigating Chamber would not\nlook into the merits of the case against her.\n\nB.

Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-2 Filed l2/l8/2o Page 4 of 4\n\nArticle 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, l996 between the United\nStates of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition\nof any of its nationals, but the Executive Pouer of the United States has the right to do so at its\ndiscretion if it deems it appropriate.”\n\nIn application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under\nFrench law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American\njudicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to\nFrance.\n\nIt should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the\nUnited States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the\nterms of the Law of March 9, 2oo4 transposing the framework decision of June l3, 2oo2 on the\nEuropean arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused\non the sole ground of his French nationality.\n\nThis principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the\nEuropean judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between\nthe Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the\nMember States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these\nStates in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the\nmember states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising\nfrom the European Convention for the <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and\nfrom the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from\nwhich France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-2 Filed l2/23/2o Page 4 of 4\nanother state*; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in\nthe United Kingdom’: or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK\nnational security'®.

Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v.

A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\nqualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v.

The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.\nConst. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against a grand jury subpoena\nduces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,\n4lo U.S. l, ll-l2 (l973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 2ol U.S. 43, 76 (l9o6), abrogated in part on\nother grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (l964)).\n\nThe government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct\nencroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389\nUS. 347, 35l (l967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an\nexception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the\ngovernment conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has\nbeen commited and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 22\ncase and use her oun words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean\nnothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections\nbecause the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so\nwithout notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered\nwith the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the\nbasis of perjury charges.\n\nThat is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government\nsubpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a\ncivil proceeding. 7oo F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against\nself-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth\nAmendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s\nsubpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not\nargued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some\nextraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 7ol.\n\nHere, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order\nwould preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been\nindicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat\nwas the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.\n(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement\ninvestigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to\npreserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to\nquash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 38\nnot expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.\nMaxwell has already spent in pretrial detention.

Under\nour system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life\nsentence, is at its highest.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\nresolution that would, among other things, provide maximum <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath. NPA at 2 (noting that Epstein “seeks to resolve\nglobally his state and federal criminal liability”).

New York, 4o4 U.S. 257, 262 (l97l).\n\nWhile plea agreements are interpreted under basic principles of contract law, the Second\nCircuit has noted that “plea agreements . . . are unique contracts in which special due process\nconcerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards obtain.” United States v. Ready,\n82 F.3d 55l, 558 (2d Cir. l996) (internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v.\nMozer, 828 F.

And the government has\nacknouledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current\nindictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the\nvictims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).\n\nAs noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his\nputative co-conspirators to the maximum extent possible. Had the government intended to limit\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> to a specific time period or to violations of specific statutes, it could have done so.\nIt did not. Thus, by charging Ms. Maxwell with conduct in which she allegedly engaged as part\nof a conspiracy with Epstein—conduct that predates the NPA—the government has violated the\nNPA.\n\na\n\nIn sum, none of the three arguments proffered by the government regarding the\napplicability of the NPA is meritorious. Ms. Maxwell is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA\nwith standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision. The co-conspirator immunity\nprovision binds all USAQOs and is not limited to the SDFL. It imposes no limitation on the scope\nof covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the\nco-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the\ngovernment. Because the co-conspirator immunity provision bars the government’s prosecution\nof Ms. Maxwell on charges arising out of her alleged conspiracy with Epstein, the indictment\nshould be dismissed.\n\nI. In the Alternative, the Court Should Permit Discovery and Conduct an Evidentiary\n\nHearing Regarding the Parties’ Intent.\n\nThe language of the NPA and the facts submited herewith are more than sufficient for\nthe Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, particularly when any\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo26o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 35 of 38\ncontract arising out of commercial negotiations among private parties, we believe the court did\nnot correctly apply the standards that govern the interpretation of plea agreements with the\ngovernment. We have long recognized that plea agreements are significantly different from\ncommercial contracts.” Feldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (emphasis added). The court explained:\n\nGovernment conduct in negotiating plea agreements must comport with the\n\nhighest standard of fairness. Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation.

That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”).

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283.

But again, the cause of the\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002838.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOnouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafad¢? bf 26 2o\nalleged exclusion here (e.g. people moving) is an external force.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658. |\nAccordingly, this argument must be rejected under Rioux.\" See id. |\nIn sum, Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements under Duren.\nAccordingly, his fair cross-section challenge under the Sixth Amendment and J SSA must be\nrejected. |\ni. Equal <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Challenge :\nSchulte next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors violates the Equal <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> clause under the Fifth Amendment. (Schulte Br. at | |\nl6-l7.) As noted above, the Equal <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> clause forbids the exclusion of racial minorities\nfrom grand and petit juries. Castaneda, 43o U.S. at 492. But to establish a prima facie violation\nof equal <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>, Schulte must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.\nBiaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o). Because Schulte cannot make such a shouing, his 2\nEqual <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> challenge fails. His only contention on this element is that the\nunderrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans “cannot be the result of\n° Under New York law, voters are designated “inactive” when a “County Board received\ninformation indicating that a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”\n\n- Common Cause/New York v. Brehm, 432 F. Supp.3d 285, 29o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (examining New\nYork voting law). |\nlo The Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s remaining allegations of systematic exclusion, which\nare that (l) jurors drawn from the overlapping counties were inequitably prorated between the :\ntwo courthouses, and (2) a technical glitch in the White Plains master wheel excluded jurors who )\nhad provided an alternative address when registering to vote. As to the former claim, Schulte has\nnot shoun that this alleged error caused the underrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2o2l WL |\n43l458, at *ll (finding same error to have had “minimal” effect on venires). And as to the later |\nclaim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not diminished, African American\nand Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel. (Gov't Opp. Br. at l7.)\n\nAccordingly, these allegations do not satisfy the third prong under Duren.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002839.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads £8 26 2o\n\nchance.” (Schulte Br. at l7.) But the Court will not assume or infer that this District has been\noperating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since 2oo9. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 659 :\n(rejecting Equal <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> challenge due to lack of evidence shouing intentional\ndiscrimination). Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions. LaChance, 788 F.2d\nat 87o, “Mere technical violations of the procedures prescribed by the Act do not constitute :\nsubstantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for\ndifferentiating between a substantial and technical error turns on the “nature and extent of its |\neffects[.]” Id. The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at l9.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the exclusion of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion\nprong of the Sixth Amendment analysis. See supra l5-l7. But because Schulte pleads these |\ndefects as separate violations of the JSSA, the Court conducts a separate analysis here. |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 35 of 239\nprosecution . . . will be instituted in this District”). In other words, the NPA was expressly limited\nto the USAO-SDFL.? Given this provision, it would be unnatural to read a broader application to\nother districts—based on no textual indicia—into the provision relating to co-conspirators.\nMoreover, the defendant’s reading of the NPA would require the Court to adopt the view that,\nwhere a plea agreement contains limiting terms, they must be repeated in every paragraph in order\nto have their natural and common-sense effects.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, the defendant’s interpretation strains common sense.\nIn order to accept the defendant’s arguments, the Court would have to reach the counterintuitive\nconclusion that Epstein expressly bargained for broader immunity for his co-conspirators than he\ndid for himself. That is, under the defendant’s reading of the agreement, Epstein bargained to\nprotect co-conspirators nationally for crimes they commited with Epstein, but Epstein only sought\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for himself in the Southern District of Florida. The text of the agreement does not\nsupport such a puzzling interpretation. Instead, the more natural reading of the NPA is that its\nrepeated references to the U.S. Atorney’s Office and “this District” reflect a universal limitation\non the NPA: it applies only to the USAO-SDFL.\n\nFinally, at several points in her motion, the defendant emphasizes that the NPA contains\nthe word “global,” but she does not appear to argue that this creates an affirmative appearance that\nthe NPA binds other districts. (Def. Mot. l at 9, l2). Nor could she. The phrase “Epstein seeks\nto resolve globally his state and federal liability,” by its terms, refers to Epstein’s liability alone.\nSee NPA at 2. Moreover, this language appears directly after several paragraphs describing\ninvestigations conducted by the Florida State Atorney’s Office and the USAO-SDFL. See id. at\nl-2. Thus, in this context, the terms “global” and “state and federal liability” plainly refer to\n> In fact, the NPA states that it was executed ‘on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United\nStates Atorney for the Southern District of Florida.” NPA at 2.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2969\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 239\nGovernment’s promises in the plea agreement to only cover past crimes, observing that “not\nlimiting the prohibition to past crimes would make it absurd and probably illegal”) (citing Aronson\nv. K. Arakelian, Inc., l54 F.2d 23l, 233 (7th Cir. l946) (“[A] contract will not be presumed to\nhave imposed an absurd or impossible condition on one of the parties, but will be interpreted as\nthe parties must be supposed to have understood the conditions at the time.”)).\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the NPA covers all violations of the Mann Act. (Def.\nMot. | at 26 n.4). Not so. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann Act, but\nnone of the provisions contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA expressly covers\nviolations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), and 2423(e), but it does not include the particular\nprovisions charged in the Indictment against Maxwell, which alleges violations of §§ 2422(a) and\n2423(a). These are plainly not the same crimes, and a plea agreement cannot be read to immunize\nunnamed crimes in the general ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated in the agreement. The\ndefendant cites no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.\n\nAccordingly, the NPA immunizes only certain, specific offenses, none of which are\ncontained in the Indictment. As a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seek the dismissal\nof the Indictment.\n\n2. The NPA Does Not Confer Enforceable Rights on Maxwell\n\nEven if this Court were to construe the NPA beyond its plain terms to preclude prosecutions\nfor the crimes contained in the Indictment, the defendant has established neither that those\nprotections extend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to pursue those protections.\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to interpret the NPA according to contract principles, and\naccord the defendant standing to enforce the NPA as a third party beneficiary. As a general mater,\nplea agreements are interpreted using principles from contract law, but that maxim is not without\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2978\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 53 of 239\npreclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever\nis longer.”).\n\nFinally, later that same year, Congress enacted a new statute as part of the Adam Walsh\nChild <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> and Safety Act of 2oo6, Pub. L. No. lo9-248, l2o Stat. 587. That statute\neliminated the statute of limitations entirely for certain crimes involving the sexual exploitation of\nminors. /d. tit. I], § 2ll(l), l2o Stat. at 6l6 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3299).\n\nB. The 2oo3 Amendment to Section 3283 Applies Retroactively\n\nCounts One through Four of the Indictment charge crimes that occurred between l994\nand l997. At the time of the offense conduct, the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3283 (l994), ran until “the child reaches the age of 25.” Houever, in 2oo3, while the statute of\nlimitations had not yet run for the crimes charged in the Indictment,!? Congress amended the\nstatute, extending the limitations period to permit a prosecution at any time “during the life of the\nchild.” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). Because the victims are all alive, the Indictment is timely under\nthe 2oo3 amendment.\n\nPut simply, the 2oo3 amendment applies to any conduct that could have been charged at\nthe time of its enactment. The legislative purpose behind Section 3283 and a plain reading of the\nstatute compel this conclusion, and courts have repeatedly held that the 2oo3 amendment applies\nretroactively, provided that the statute of limitations had not run for the offense at the time of the\namendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend, rather than shorten, the statute of limitations\napplicable to sexual abuse crimes, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the\nprosecution was timely.”) (citing United States v.

But, while the chase is on, it does not shock\n\nus to have it extended beyond the time first set, or, if it does, the\n\nstake forgives it.\nFalter v. United States, 23 F.2d 42o, 425-26 (2d Cir. l928). The distinction between statutes that\nrevive expired prosecutions and those that extend existing limitations periods has deep roots in\nestablished jurisprudence. It is well-setled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that revive\ntime-barred prosecutions, but permits laws that retroactively extend limitations periods. Stogner\nv. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632 (2oo3) (holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not “prevent\nthe State from extending time limits for . . . prosecutions not yet time barred.”); United States v.\nMorgan, ll3 F.3d l23o, l997 WL 2687l2, at *7 (2d Cir. l997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-\nstanding rule in this circuit is that Congress has the pouer to extend the period of limitations\nwithout running afoul of the ex post facto clause, provided the original period has not already\nrun.”’) (citing Falter, 23 F.3d at 425-26). And other circuits have emphasized this distinction in\nthe context of Section 3283. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 685.\n\nRead together, the Second Circuit’s decisions in Weingarten, Vernon, Enterprise, and\nFalter establish that Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable\nprosecutions. That is precisely what has occurred here, because the charges in the Indictment were\nstill timely when the 2oo3 amendment extended the limitations period. As a result, applying\nSection 3283 in this case does not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore, step two of\nLandgraf is satisfied, and Section 3283 applies retroactively.\n\nResisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal context, Landgraf’s\nsecond step provides protections beyond the Ex Post Facto Clause. But that is not the law. See\nNader, 425 F.

Ud. at l7-l8).\n\nFinally, Chief Judge McMahon also inquired whether the materials sought by the\nGovernment might be used to commence criminal proceedings against either of the parties to the\nlibel case, i.e., including Maxwell. (/d. at l8). The Government acknouledged that possibility as\na general mater. (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon noted that the parties to the protective order relied\non that order “in order to give whatever in discovery they gave, whether it was deposition\ntestimony they gave or — then again, I can’t fathom why anybody who has any criminal exposure\nwould not have taken the Fifth Amendment in response to questions in a civil deposition, but I\ndon’t knou.” (/d. at l8-l9). The Government stated, “I do not knou, but I think it is entirely\npossible that what we are seeking is page after page of people taking the Fifth. That is entirely\npossible. But to the extent that it is not or there are other materials -- and this may be bad for our\nargument, but in all transparency and candor, I think there may be other individuals who also relied\non the protective order.” (/d.). The Government further explained that it “want[ed] to have a\nformal application” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of\nproblems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 2o).\n\nb. April 9, 2ol9 Hearing\n\nChief Judge McMahon held another conference on April 9, 2ol9. She stated that she\nwanted “to make sure I’m not in a Chemical Bank kind of situation, so I would like to knou about\ncontacts between [the USAO-SDNY and Boies Schiller] prior to the issuance of the subpoena on\nthe subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.

Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v.

See, e.g., In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l, 945 F.2d at\nl224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order was improvidently granted or\nwhether the government had made a shouing of exceptional circumstances or a compelling need’’);\nPalmieri, 779 F.2d at 862 (reversing district court’s modification of protective orders where district\ncourt did not make an “express finding” of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances, or\ncompelling need and “remand|[ing] for further proceedings consistent with this opinion”).\n\n37 Maxwell asks this Court to review and reverse Chief Judge McMahon’s exercise of her\ndiscretion in modifying the protective order, because she disagrees with Chief Judge McMahon’s\nanalysis of the Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil\nprotective order was not entered on the civil docket, that order, along with the Government’s\napplication and related materials, were produced to the defense on or about August l2, 2o2o. As\na result, Maxwell could have sought review of Chief Judge McMahon’s order in the Second\nCircuit. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks this Court to second-guess a coequal district\ncourt’s decision to modify a protective order. Puting aside the question of whether this Court\neven has the authority to do so, it should in any event decline Maxwell’s invitation to act as a\nreviewing court to Chief Judge McMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”\nInre “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d at l47.\n\n38 To the extent that Maxwell seeks suppression of documents created prior to the entry of the\nprotective order (or created after its entry but not subject to its protections), that aspect of her\nmotion should be denied. A significant amount of the materials provided in response to the\nsubpoena included such pre-existing documents not created in reliance on a protective order, which\ndo not trigger the Martindell presumption in the Second Circuit, see TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at\n234-235; Davis, 7o2 F.2d at 422.

It also bears noting that Martindell and its progeny do not discuss law enforcement\napplications in Fourth Amendment terms.\n\nIn an effort to avoid the application of the third party doctrine, Maxwell contends that she\ndid not in fact voluntarily share anything in the civil suit, and that “every other circumstance”\nsupported her “expectation that her deposition transcripts would be private.” (Def. Mot. ll at 9).\nNeither argument withstands scrutiny. As an initial mater, the facts of this case are far removed\nfrom the “narrou” circumstances in which the Supreme Court has found an exception to the third\nparty doctrine. For example, the Carpenter Court, while stressing that its holding was a “narrou\none,” l38 S. Ct. at 222o, held that “[g]iven the unique nature of cell phone location records,” which\nprovide a “intimate windou into a person’s life,” “the fact that the information is held by a third\nparty does not by itself overcome the user’s claim to Fourth Amendment <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>.” /d. at 22l7;\nsee also Zietzke v. United States, 426 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768 (W.D. Wash. 2ol9) (“The Court...\nwill extend Carpenter to new circumstances only if they directly implicate the privacy concerns\nthat animated the majority. [T]he majority was overwhelmingly concerned with ‘Carpenter’s\nanticipation of privacy in his physical location.’ In other words, Carpenter was about\nsurveillance.” (internal citation omited)).\n\nThere can be no serious argument that the facts of this case, or the materials obtained\npursuant to the subpoena issued here, revealed Maxwell’s physical location over a period of time\nor are otherwise in any way analogous to the narrou category of information contemplated by the\nmajority in Carpenter. To the extent the defendant argues that her deposition transcripts implicate\nsuch interests because she “did not ‘voluntarily convey’ her testimony to Giuffre,” (Def.

Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\nrecognized that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4.

There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be sufficient: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the\nsame offense.” United States v.

(See Def. Mot. l2 at 2). In particular, the\ndefendant suggests that the failure to identify each minor victim by name, the presence of a date\nrange rather than specific dates, and the use of certain language that the defendant claims not to\nunderstand render Counts One through Four so deficient that they must be dismissed. Because the\ndefendant cites no authority indicating that violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 37l, 2422, or 2423 fall into\nthe rare exception to “the rule that ‘an indictment need do litle more than to track the language of\nthe statute charged,’” her motion should be denied.

(quoting Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24).\n\nFirst, the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged conduct does not\nwarrant dismissal of the Indictment.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ntee, l98\ncrime.\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. Jd. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

Ghislaine Maxwell, et al.\n(“Guiffre’), l5 Civ. 7433 (RWS) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is enclosed as Exhibit A.\n\nBackground\n\nAs described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena\n(the *Subpoena’’) upon Boies Schiller & Flexner (“Boies Schiller’) requiring the production of\ncopies of discovery and related materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\nThe Government has been advised that Boies Schiller, which is counsel for plaintiffs in the\nLitigation, does not intend to contest the Subpoena. Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a protective order entered in the Litigation (the “Protective Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL —\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case. As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54\nF.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), which rejected an application for a party in civil litigation to be held\nin contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order,\nwithout first obtaining authorization from the court, because the court would have granted such\nauthorization had it been sought. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\nId. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law enforcement against <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo848\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality. It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In sucha case, ““[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’\"” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

P. 6(e), and further notes and emphasizes\nthat the proposed order accompanying the Application provides no additional exception or\nmodification to the Protective Order as to the recipient of the subpoena other than the narrou,\nlimited ability to comply with grand jury process.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An application of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo85l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot.

Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the\nbankruptcy examination in that case “was made available to the public”).

Epstein, et al. (“Jane Doe”),\nl7 Civ. 6l6 (JGK) (SN) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is atached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\nBackground\n\nAs described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena\n(the *Subpoena’’) upon Boies Schiller & Flexner (“Boies Schiller’) requiring the production of\ncopies of discovery and related materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena was validly\nissued pursuant to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others, for possible violations\nof Title l8, United States Code, Sections l59l and l594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and\nSection 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”). The production of materials\npursuant to the Subpoena is solely for the purposes of the Investigation, and is subject to the\nprotections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).\n\nThe Government has been advised that Boies Schiller, which is counsel for plaintiffs in the\nLitigation, does not intend to contest the Subpoena. Houever, the Government is advised that\nalthough Boies Schiller would not otherwise contest compliance with the Subpoena, it believes\nthat a protective order entered in the Litigation (the “Protective Order”) may preclude compliance.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requested that the Court issue an order\npermiting Boies Schiller to comply with the validly-issued Subpoena.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL =\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case. As described belou, a court can and should\nmodify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allou the recipient of a grand jury\nsubpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.\nThe Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., l54\nF.R.D. 9l (S.D.N.Y. l994), which rejected an application for a party in civil litigation to be held\nin contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order,\nwithout first obtaining authorization from the court, because the court would have granted such\nauthorization had it been sought. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:\nThe role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by\nthe Federal Criminal Code (Title l8, USC) and in enforcing Grand\nJury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information\navailable to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing\nshouing that the need for the information for such purposes is\noutweighed by the need for protecting expectations of\nconfidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\nId. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8, 42l-22 (2d Cir. l983) (finding that the\n“conflict between <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a\ncriminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent\napplicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no\nshiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury\nwhich subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94\n(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been\nnecessary of interests of law enforcement against <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of\nthe discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omited).!\n' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described belou, the Government’s specific\nknouledge of the subject mater of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential\nnature of the Litigation; houever, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo355l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality. It is not by itself'a valid reason for courts to uphold\n\nconfidentiality as against a legitimate law enforcement need for the\n\ninformation. Courts must honor restrictions laid doun by the Fourt\n\nor Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of disclosure is well knoun to the Bar, in part because disclosure may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In such a case, “‘[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’*” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public disclosure of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 6 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—relied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An application of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo923\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6of6\n\nPage 6\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (describing such materials a “technological trade secrets,\ncurrently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which\ncould benefit rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to among the gravest\ncriminal offenses it investigates—the sexual exploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,\nwould tend to inculpate and/or embarrass some parties to the Protective Order. Indeed, by the very\nterms of the Protective Order, the confidential materials appear to be of the category for which\n“Ta]voiding embarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality\nas against a legitimate law enforcement need for the information.” J/d.; see also Prot.

The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to\nand deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2ool and 2oo7.\n\nMaxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the\noffenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase\n“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in\nwhat?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who\nconspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those\noffenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by Epstein\nfrom 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation.\n\nThe Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.\nThose charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from\ndepositions in 2ol6, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell nou\nconcedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in its\nentirety, perjury counts and all.\n\nThe Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope. The Sl\nsuperseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between l994 and l997, some\nfour years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the\nNPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes commited\nbefore the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> is no broader.

Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\nGiuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\nGiuffre’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell.

Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4). And “‘knouing’ means with full awareness of the nature of the right\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it.” /d.\n\nHere, Maxwell did not knouingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to\ninvoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the\nunderstanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it\nturned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies\nSchiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material\nJudge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right\nand avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government fails in its atempt to distinguish United States v.\nOshatz, 7oo F.

The government says that the logic of\nOshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here,\nMaxwell was deposed “over two years before the Government opened its investigation.” Resp. at\nloo; id. at lo2 (noting that the defendant in Oshaiz “had already been indicted at the time of his\ndeposition in a civil case for almost seven months’’).

First, BSF admits that these communications occurred. Second, the\ncommunications about trying to get Ms. Maxwell indicted were “prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial,” admiting both relevance and admissibility. BSF does not and cannot\nplausibly explain hou a joint effort to procure a civil opponent’s indictment is protected by the\nwork product doctrine. BSF’s ipse dixit fails because the\n\n“burden of justifying the application of the work product doctrine is on the asserting\n\nparty, and the burden is a heavy one because privileges are neither lightly created\n\nnor expansively construed.

Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (not an abuse of discretion to deny continuance for a\nsuperseding indictment that extended the conspiracy range by one month).\n\nIn this case, the changes to the indictment were anything but minimal. The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research\nMs. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions\nof pages of discovery including travel records, phone records, bank records, photographs, diaries,\nmessage pads, credit card records, and countless other records for the eleven-year versus four\nyear period, will take hundreds, if not thousands, of atorney and staff hours.\n\nC. The new, and old, discovery require review (and re-review) and analysis.\n\nThe government, on April l3, 2o2l, produced more than 2o,ooo pages of “new”\ndiscovery. Although the government represented that this production is related to “non-testifying\nwitnesses,” it is more accurately described as exculpatory Brady material.

Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in their communications. The Defendant’s overbroad Requests make it impossible for\nBSF to determine hou many responsive communications would be protected and why. Again, it\nis the Defendant’s burden to demonstrate that all of the communications she seeks would be\nrelevant and admissible, and it is not BSF’s burden to review broad swaths of material to determine\nwhat the Defendant is entitled to under Rule l7.\n\nCi Communications Between BSF and the Government Are Procurable from the\n\nGovernment.\n\nEven if Requests l through 5 could overcome Nixon’s three hurdles, houever, Requests l\nand 2 would still fail to the extent that they ask for communications with the Government, which\nthe Defendant can procure from the Government. The Defendant admits that the Government has\nthe communications she is seeking, but complains that the Government “has failed to produce, or\neven look for these communications and Ms. Maxwell has no other means to obtain them.” Resp.\nLtr. at 8.

Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six Would Violate Her Rights Under\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nProsecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six would also violate her rights under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall “be subject\nfor the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const., Amend. V. The\nClause protects criminal defendants against “a second prosecution for the same offense after\nacquital,” “a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,” and “multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4)\n(quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 7ll, 7l7 (l969) overruled on other grounds by\nAlabama v. Smith, 49o U.S. 794 (l989)). The Supreme Court first established the principle that\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense almost\nl5o years ago in Ex Parte Lange, 85 U.S. (l8 Wall.) l63 (l873), and it is equally important as\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against a successive prosecution for the same offense.\n\nIf there is anything setled in the jurisprudence of England and\nAmerica, it is that no man can be twice lawfully punished for the\nsame offence.

The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l54 of 349\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n\nZi Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\n\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\n\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\n\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\n\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\n\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\n\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\n\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\nerm, “*\n\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)(), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\n\nC. Case Law\n\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\n\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004452.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l55 of 349\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. /d. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\nDe Plea Agreement Promises of Leniency touards a Third Party\n\nCase law regarding promises made during plea negotiations not to prosecute a third-party\n\narises in two contexts.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

That phrase appears in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s\nopinion, in which the panel rejected the defendants’ atempt to distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi\nby saying that they were only seeking the same <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nwhile Abbamonte and Alessi involved protections greater than the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nAnnabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In rejecting that argument, the Court explained:\n\nThe argument fails for two reasons. First, since appellants were\n\nnever in jeopardy on the charges dismissed in the Eastern District,\n\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> they nou seek under the plea agreement is necessarily\n\nbroader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,\n\nto the extent that the appellants rely on a claim that the Clause, if\n\napplicable, would protect them from prosecution on charges\n\nidentical to those dismissed, the short answer is that the pending\n\ncharges, covering conduct extending more than two years beyond\n\nthe date of the period covered by the dismissed charges, are not the\n\nsame as the charges that were dismissed. Even if, as appellants\n\ncontend, the Southern District charges result from the same\n\nconspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the\n\nEastern District, the allegation that the conspiracy extended for an\n\nadditional two years suffices to shou that the new charges are not\n\nidentical to the dismissed charges.\nId. As the foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit did not in any way qualify the plain-statement\nrule set forth in its opinion. Rather, the Second Circuit addressed the defendant’s efforts to\ndistinguish precedent based on the Double Jeopardy Clause and explained why the Clause did not\npreclude a prosecution in that case. In other words, this language in Annabi was cabined to an\nanalysis under the Double Jeopardy Clause. As discussed in greater detail belou, the Double\nJeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution in this case because Maxwell has not previously\nbeen prosecuted for the offenses in the S2 Indictment.\n\nIgnoring the Double Jeopardy language in Annabi, the defendant argues that the phrase\n“identical to the dismissed charges” somehou creates a different rule of interpretation for plea\nagreements, under which the Court must first analyze the similarity between the NPA and the S2\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004718.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 26\ncrimes listed in the NPA overlap with some (but not all)? of the offenses in the S2 Indictment. But\nat this stage of the litigation, in which the Court has already concluded that the NPA has no force\nin this District, it makes no difference what the precise terms of the NPA were. The NPA has no\nbearing on this case.\n\nThe balance of the defendant’s motion seeks to relitigate the Court’s rulings in this case,\nasserting that the history of the negotiations of the NPA indicate that the parties intended broader\ncoverage. (Def. Mot. at l6). This Court has firmly rejected that argument and has concluded that\n“In]o evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his\ncoconspirators in other districts.” (Apr. Op. at 6). The motion should be denied for precisely this\nreason.\n\nII. Counts Five and Six Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause\nIt is axiomatic that “an accused must suffer jeopardy before he can suffer double\njeopardy.” Serfass v. United States, 42o U.S. 377, 393 (l975). Here, the S2 Indictment is the first\ntime the defendant has been charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy, and the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause therefore does not prohibit prosecution of those offenses. The\ndefendant’s argument to the contrary fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.\n\n“TA]t its core,” the Double Jeopardy Clause “means that those acquited or convicted of a\nparticular ‘offence’ cannot be tried a second time for the same ‘offence.’”” Gamble v. United States,\nl39 S. Ct. l96o, l963 (2ol9). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double Jeopardy\nclaim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime before the alleged\n‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir. l997). As the Second\n> At most, the scope of the NPA’s coverage would appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The\nremaining counts encompass conduct that both postdates and predates the temporal limitations in\nthe NPA, which was expressly limited to offenses between 2ool and 2oo7. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 26\nCircuit has explained, the “key issue” for jeopardy atachment is “whether the disposition of an\nindividual’s indictment entailed findings of facts on the merits such that the defendant was placed\nin genuine jeopardy by the making of such findings.” United States v. Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d 78, 83\n(2d Cir. 2oo7), cert. denied, l29 S. Ct. l58 (2oo8); see United States v. Vanhoesen, 366 F. App’x\n264, 266-67 (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“Jeopardy ataches when ‘there has been a fact-based\nresolution of elements of the offense charged as a result of a process in which the defendant risked\nconviction.’” (quoting Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 85)). Traditionally, jeopardy ataches “to the entire\nindictment as soon as a jury is empaneled.” Podde, lo5 F.3d at 8l6.\n\nIn the context of pretrial dispositions, it is “essential” for jeopardy atachment that the\nresolution involve “adjudication of some facts that go to the merits of a charge against a\ndefendant.” Dionisio, 5o3 F.3d at 84 (emphasis in original). For a guilty plea, jeopardy ataches\nto the offense of conviction. See Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool) (“Given that\na guilty plea is a conviction, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a second\nprosecution for the same offense after conviction, the Clause prohibits a second prosecution for\nthe same offense follouing a guilty plea.” (citations and internal quotation marks omited)). But\nit generally does not atach to counts that are dismissed simply pursuant to “an agreement between\nthe parties,” involving no “process that put [the defendant] at any risk of conviction.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 89; see Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[S]ince appellants were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges dismissed in the Eastern District, the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> they nou seek under the plea agreement\nis necessarily broader than that accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.”); United States v.\nHernandez, No. o9 Cr. 625 (HB), 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l, 2oo9) (explaining,\nunder Dionisio, that where “Judge Hellerstein merely granted the Government’s motion to dismiss\nCount One pursuant to the plea agreement,” jeopardy did not atach to Count One); cf Evans v.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 26\nMichigan, 568 U.S. 3l3, 3l9 (2ol3) (distinguishing between a “merits-related ruling” during trial\nthat “concludes proceedings absolutely” under the Double Jeopardy Clause and “termination of\nthe proceedings . . . on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense” (internal\nquotation marks omited)). In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida. She was never indicted, acquited, convicted, or punished for the\noffenses in Counts Five and Six. See United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 279 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(explaining that “[i]n essence, the Double Jeopardy Clause protects criminal defendants against”\nsecond prosecutions after acquital or conviction, or “multiple punishments for the same offense”\n(quotation marks omited)). At no point did the defendant even risk conviction.\n\nThat analysis is unaffected by the NPA. Again, neither the defendant nor Epstein was ever\nindicted by a grand jury siting in the Southern District of Florida nor found guilty of any federal\noffense. NPA or no NPA, jeopardy never atached for the offenses in the proposed USAO-SDFL\nindictment, which was of course never filed. See United States v.

A civil protective order may (as here)\nbe limited by its terms to pretrial proceedings, in which case the parties must expect that\nconfidential documents will come to light as the case progresses.

Because the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> typically\nafforded by a civil protective order is both porous and ephemeral, the Second Circuit has held\nthat “a non-consenting witness may not be forced to answer potentially incriminating questions\nin reliance upon such an order.” Andover, 876 F.2d at lo84. Maxwell was free to assert her\nFifth Amendment rights in her civil case and refuse to offer incriminating testimony.\nLongstanding precedent made clear that if she did not do so, the Government could use any such\ntestimony that it learned of against her in a later criminal case. Because the Government did not\ncompel Maxwell to offer incriminating testimony, it did not violate her right against compelled\nself-incrimination.\n\nMaxwell’s alternative argument that BSF’s act of turning over her deposition transcripts\nwas itself compelled testimony is likewise without merit. The Supreme Court has held that the\nact of producing documents in response to a subpoena implicates the Fifth Amendment only in\nnarrou circumstances—when the existence of responsive documents, rather than their content, is\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo479l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l4 of 8o\nlight.

In fact, Constand did not learn of the decision\nuntil a reporter appeared at one of her civil atorney’s offices later that evening. With the\nresolution of her allegations removed from the criminal courts, Constand turned to the\ncivil realm. On March 8, 2ol5, less than one month after the district atorney’s press\nrelease, Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania.®\n\nDuring discovery in that lawsuit, Cosby sat for four depositions. Cosby's atorney\nfor the civil proceedings, John Schmit, had learned about the non-prosecution decision\nfrom Cosby’s criminal counsel, Walter Phillips. From the perspective of Cosby’s\natorneys, the district atorney’s decision legally deprived Cosby of any right or ability to\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, not once during the four depositions did Cosby\ninvoke the Fifth Amendment or even mention it. During one deposition, Atorney Schmit\nadvised Cosby not to answer certain questions pertaining to Constand, but he did not\nspecifically invoke the Fifth Amendment.’ Nor did Cosby claim the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment when asked about other alleged victims of his sexual abuse, presumably\nbecause he believed that he no longer retained that privilege. In fact, no one involved\nwith either side of the civil suit indicated on the record a belief that Cosby could be\nprosecuted in the future. D.A.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights.

(Ic. 5-7, l2.) This destruction obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |\nas to the parties themselves.

The docket sheet in Giuffre v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |\nfrequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the Giuffre Action was |\nconducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |\nmater. | |\nThe Giuffre Action was setled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |\nstipulation for dismissal on May 25, 2ol7, which was shortly before the trial was to begin.

The Court agrees with the Government that, because the investigation is not |\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify :\nand to produce documents]... would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the :\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo897 :\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4947 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 26 of 27\n, To Be Filed Under Seal\nto use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury\n\nproceeding.

In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |\n296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |\nevidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena pouer. Here, |\nhouever, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |\nproduction of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |\n;\nbolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |\nAtorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, l992, l F.3d 87, 94 |\nn.4 (2d Cir. l993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |\n“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |\nrequest comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :\nPetition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lol (2d Cir. l997), gives Maxwell the degree of <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> that |\ncould reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2\nFinally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |\nhere the Government is in no position to narrou its request, because the Giuffre Action was |\nlitigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. l9, |\nl99l, 945 F.2d at l223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |\nincluded deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”).

Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI.

Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v.

The Court Should Permit Certain Witnesses to Testify Under Pseudonyms or\nUsing First Names, and Permit the Sealing of Related Exhibits\n\nThe Government requests, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, that the Court take\ncertain measures at trial to protect the dignity and privacy of victims.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool).

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J.

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page5ofl6\nl the case, and the information will not affect whether or not you are selected to serve as a juror in\n2 this case.

This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Hershkouitz et al.

The authors reported\nthat parents did shou a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to\nthe disclosure.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct\nquestions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,\nsignificant proportions disclosed follouing prompts rather than it being\ninitiated by the child (Kogan, 2oo4). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews\n\n. . with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in\n‘Investigating the investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children.\nprecise McElvaney (2oo8) found that parents’ questioning of children was prompted\ncircumstances that by their concern about the young person’s emotional distress. On occasion,\n\n. young people were communicating that something was not right in their world\nled to disclosures for but were not able to articulate this verbally. Signs of psychological distress\nchildren’ were, houever, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress\nwere identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.\nThus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse\nbecause they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2oo2) folloued up a sample of\ntheir respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their\nsurvey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many\ncete respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked.

Mudaly and Goddard (2oo6) quote\ncaregivers, friends or a l3-year-old girl: ‘she (mother) helped by not making me, not rushing me\n\n; to get it out, which, um, I think it’s a really stupid idea to make kids get it\nothers out A.S.A.P? (p. 9l).\n\nImplications for Practice\nThe consensus in the research literature at the present time is that disclosure is\nmulti-determined, influenced by a complex range of factors that may influence\neach child in a different way. Large-scale national probability studies confirm\nthat non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing\nsociety and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the\nwellbeing of children. Children’s fears and anxieties in relation to telling need\nto be understood and contained by those in their environment so that early\n. . . disclosure can be encouraged and facilitated.\n\n‘The implications of The implications of these findings can be considered in interrelated\nthese findings can be contexts: the legal context where action can only be taken if the child is able\n, . to give a clear, credible account of his/her experiences; child <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> and\n\nconsidered in ; ; ; ; ;\n. therapeutic contexts where a comprehensive account is required to enable child\ninterrelated contexts’ <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> professionals to intervene and where the psychological sequelae can\nbe addressed to minimise the long-term impact of the experiences; and family\nand community contexts where early disclosure needs to be encouraged, and\nCopyright © 2ol3 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals engaged\nwith children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both\ninitial and further disclosures.\nContradiction in witness statements is a well-knoun feature of false statements | ‘Contradiction in\nand giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted witness statements is\nwithin child <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an\nearlier account. Listening to children’s accounts of their experiences of disclosure a well-knoun feature\nhelps us understand why it is that disclosure can be delayed and that when they do | of false statements’\nfeel ready to tell this is not an ‘all or nothing’ decision. As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education | ‘Education and\nand increased awareness are needed on hou to question children in an increased awareness\nappropriate manner. McElvaney (2oo8) noted that questions did not need to\nbe about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young are needed on hou to\nperson’s psychological distress, asking after the young people’s wellbeing. | question children in\nThis questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person | an appropriate\nto tell his/her secret (McElvaney ef al., 2ol2). In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\ninstruction on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the conspiracy. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a conspiracy because Curley was not charged with a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of interstate violation of\na <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\nconspiracy. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain.

United\nStates v.

Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (l986) (discussing a district court’s\n“wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based on concerns about,\namong other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witnesses’ safety, or\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,” notwithstanding the Confrontation\nClause). The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page4of8\nkept confidential because it was information the Government “would want to knou” and “Jane\nwould want the government to knou,” (Def. Leter at 2); and (2) any privilege was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the privilege that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the privilege. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\nessential to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be essential to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not privileged. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient relationship. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that relationship\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\ncooperation agreement. Once the cooperation agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is privileged.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document529 Filed l2/o8/2l Page /7ofl8 7\nLBF 3MAXC\n\nl to go back over in the voir dire and inquire about.

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a setlement with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page2of3\nand Shawn, and their prior convictions were only discussed briefly during their direct testimony—\nand not at all on cross-examination. Including the instruction therefore would not serve its\nintended purpose. Rather, it would have the opposite effect of overemphasizing the prior\nconvictions.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless gives this instruction, the Government requests that it be included\nas part of the Court’s general instruction on credibility, Instruction 44. That instruction already\ndiscusses particular circumstances of certain witnesses, namely, those testifying under\npseudonyms. Because the proposed instruction at most reflects brief testimony by only two\nwitnesses, it is appropriate to provide, at most, a similarly brief and balanced treatment of the\ninstruction.\n\nSecond, the Government opposes the removal of “equally” from the standard instruction\nregarding uncalled witnesses. During the charge conference, the defense argued that some\nwitnesses were not “equally” available because they would or did invoke their <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> against\nself-incrimination.

Myerson, l8 F.3d l53, l58 (2d Cir. l994) (collecting cases);\nsee United States v. Romero, 3o4 F. App’x l4, l8 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (summary order) (affirming the\n“equally unavailable” instruction where a witness invoked the protections of the Fifth\nAmendment); Sand Instr. 6-7 (explaining that the “uncalled witness equally available” instruction\n“includes situations when the witness has indicated that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right\nnot to testify if called”). That is a sensible result: a witness with criminal jeopardy is not\n“available” to the Government in any more than an abstract sense.

See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions.

Intervention in criminal trials may be granted to protect the\nrights of third parties\nIt is indisputable that precedent supports interventions by interested third parties in\ncriminal maters, as such have been repeatedly granted in “circumstances where ‘a third party’s\nconstitutional or other federal rights are implicated by the resolution of a particular motion,\nrequest, or other issue during the course of a criminal case.’” United States v.

King, l4o F3d 76, 83 (2d Cir l998). Support for such a release was\nbased on the holding that limitations to access of voir dire materials are only permissible when\nthere is a demonstrated need, and the limitations are narrouly drawn and supported by findings.\nId., at 82-83.\n\nThe decision to release jury questionnaires and voir dire transcripts is subject to a\nbalancing test. United States v Bruno, 7oo F Supp 2d l75, l82-83 (NDNY 2olo). The Court\nmust use its discretion to “make a sensitive appraisal of the climate surrounding a trial and a\nprediction as to the potential security or publicity problems that may arise” before, during, and\nafter the proceedings.

Colombo, 869 F.2d l49, l5l (2d Cir. l989) (noting false\nanswers prevent “follou-up questions” that may expose bias).\n\nIn this case, the first prong under McDonough is satisfied by Juror 5o’s press statements\nshouing that his purported voir dire answers — that he was not sexually abused as a child and that\nhe would view abuse victim witnesses like any other witness — were untrue. Juror 5o apparently\ntoldthe Court in his Questionnaire that he would assess the credibility of alleged sex crime victims\n“Just the way [he] would any other witness” (Question 47), and he denied that he had been the\nvictim of sexual abuse (Question 48). Further, he was asked if he or anyone close to him had any\nexperience that would affect his ability to be fair and impartial, and he apparently said no.\n(Question 5o). Question 5l even gave Juror 5o the opportunity to answer these questions\nconfidentially to avoid embarrassment or protect his privacy, but he reportedly declined.

And the fact that the defense failed to\nseek or receive a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for\nincluding a limiting instruction in the final charge. (Tr. 2777). The Court, the Government, and\nthe defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury understood that the Mann Act\ncounts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York. That the defense missed\nan additional opportunity for a limiting instruction is not a prejudicial variance, much less a\nconstructive amendment.\nI. The Court Should Enter Judgment on Counts Three and Five\n\nThe S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Counts One and\nThree were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged\na conspiracy based on the Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act. As the Court held in an April l6,\n2o2l Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.\nNo. 2o7 at 27). Follouing the verdict, houever, the Government agrees that the Court should enter\njudgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the similarities between those\ncounts. Accordingly, of the three conspiracy counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government\nsubmits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l.\n\nCounts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both\ncounts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail belou, Counts Three and Five arose from\ndifferent criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,\nand a different modus operandi. The defendant ignores these important distinctions, claiming, in\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 28 of5l\n\nl. Offenses Charged\n\nTurning to the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses charged,” Counts Three and Five\nplainly charge different criminal offenses under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. In particular, Count Three is\npredicated on l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), a provision of the Mann Act that makes it a crime to transport\nminors for illegal sexual activity, whereas Count Five is predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a\nprovision of the Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors for\ncommercial sex acts. As charged in the $2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:\nCount Three concerned transporting girls under the age of seventeen to New York for purposes of\nsexual abuse in violation of New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and Count Five concerned commercial\nsex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.\n\nWhen two counts charge conspiracies under § 37l, “[s]imilarity at this general level . . . is\nof limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracies differ. United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr.\n4o (JBA), 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669). For example, in Villa, the district court concluded that, under\nthe first Korfant factor, two § 37l offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count was “‘to\ncommit theft from an interstate shipment and to transport stolen property across state lines,”\nwhereas the other conspiracy was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl concluded that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate conspiracy under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd sub nom. United States v.

First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009630.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 632 Filed o3/o7/22 Page5of8\nUNITED STA TES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnitedSutes = SSS”S*~*~*~*~**SCS*SC LARA\nv. : S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell :\n-------- eee --X\nState of New York\nCounty of New York\n\nLara Pomerantz, pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section l746, hereby\ndeclares under penalty of perjury:\n\nLs I am an Assistant United States Atorney in the office of DAMIAN\nWILLIAMS, United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York, and as such I am one\nof the Assistant United States Atorneys responsible for the prosecution United States v.

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\nquestionnaire, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe questionnaire and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s explanation that he “flew through” the questionnaire does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page /7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel4of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6).

The Sentencing\nCommission created § 4Bl.5 after the passage of the <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> of Children from Sexual\nPredators Act of l998 (the “Act”). See Pub. Law lo5-3l4 (Oct. 3o, l998). As part of the Act,\nCongress directed the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Sentencing Guidelines\napplicable to several offenses involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the\nenticement and transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were\n“appropriately severe.” /d., Section 5o2. Congress also specifically directed the Sentencing\nCommission to review the guidelines applicable to these and other sexual abuse offenses and\npromulgate amendments “to increase penalties applicable to the[se] offenses ... in any case in\nwhich the defendant engaged in a patern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of\na minor.” /d., Section 5o5. In response, the Sentencing Commission created § 4Bl.5, which was\nadded to the Sentencing Guidelines on November l, 2ool. See USSG, App’x C, amend. 6l5.\n\nThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and § 4Bl.5\nspecifically, was to protect children from habitual sexual predators and to inflict severe\npunishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who present a significant risk of recidivism.\nCongress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to the community\nbecause they are typically far more likely to re-offend than other criminal defendants — a fact\nwhich numerous members of Congress cited as a primary justification for the passage of the Act.\n\ne “Constituents deserve to be protected from society’s worst offender-- the repeat\n\nsexual predator.... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly\nhigh — released rapists are lo times more likely to repeat their crime than other\ncriminals.

The\ncommentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who\npresent a continuing danger to the community because there is a significant risk that they will re-\noffend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4Bl.5, cmt. background (“This guideline is\nintended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors\nand who present a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); see also United States v.\nBroxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 285 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (“We further note that this guideline [$4Bl.5] is\nintended to identify ‘repeat sex offenders,’ who pose ‘a continuing danger to the public.’” (citing\nUSSG § 4Bl.5 cmt. background)).

The Government did not argue that\nthose witnesses merited pseudonyms on their oun, but rather that they needed derivative\nanonymity to protect the Minor Victims.\n\nNumerous other witnesses testified at trial for the Government under their true name,\nincluding those closely associated with the defendant and Epstein, such as Larry Visoski, Juan\nAlessi, David Rodgers, and Nicole Hesse.

First, it seeks anonymity for\ncategories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permited to testify with their\nidentities protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right to a fair trial or\nto present a defense.\n\nFirst, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established categories of witnesses\nwho courts have permited to testify under pseudonyms. The defendant does not even suggest that\nPo fits into any such category. (Def. Leter at 8-9). Indeed, the defense concedes\n' The Government also offered a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those\nrequests largely, if not entirely, concerned (l) witnesses whom the Court permited to testify using\npseudonyms or under their first names; (2) personal identifying information, such as addresses; (3)\ninformation related to third parties, that is, individuals who are not testifying at trial or at issue in\nthe case; or (4) exhibits where information for testifying witnesses was co-mingled with private\ninformation so extensively that redactions were impractical.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of8\nstake in the manner of other victims, and testifying under her true name will not chill the decision\nof other victims to come forward.

Exhibits with witness or third-party identifying\ninformation were filed under seal or redacted. (As noted above, there were at least forty-five\ntimes when an exhibit or series of exhibit was admited either partially or fully under seal to\nprotect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness.)

Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in\norder to determine their rights and what is, in the complex of laws and regulations,\ndeemed to be legal and correct. Based upon experience, lawyers knou” that almost all\nclients follou the advice given, and the law is upheld. Paragraph (a) thus recognizes a\nfundamental principle in the lawyer-client relationship, that, in the absence of the client’s\ninformed consent,* a lawyer must not reveal information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).

(See /n the\nMater of Johnson (Rev. Dept. 2ooo) 4 Cal. State Bar Ct. Rptr. l79; Goldstein v. Lees\n(l975) 46 Cal.App.3d 6l4, 62l [l2o Cal.Rptr. 253].) The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion. Thus, a lawyer may not\nreveal such information except with the informed consent* of the client or as authorized\nor required by the State Bar Act, these rules, or other law.\n\nNarrou exception to duty of confidentiality under this rule\n[3] Notwithstanding the important public policies promoted by lawyers adhering to\nthe core duty of confidentiality, the overriding value of life permits disclosures otherwise\nprohibited by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l).\nParagraph (b) is based on Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision\n(e)(2), which narrouly permits a lawyer to disclose information protected by Business\nand Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) even without client consent.\nEvidence Code section 956.5, which relates to the evidentiary lawyer-client privilege,\nsets forth a similar express exception. Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\ndisclosure to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 24 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only\nwhere subsequent charges are “sufficiently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier\nagreement.

Id. at 298\n(noting that alleged Soviet espionage against the United States was a controversial\nand historically significant issue in domestic politics during the l94os and l95os, and\nto the present day).\n\nDisclosure is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the\ngovernment’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions.

Thus, Ms. Farmer’s and other victims’ privacy interests as victims of Epstein and Maxwell\nweigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information.\nB. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-\nConspirators Are Improper.\n\nThe Government’s original motion refers to a July 6, 2o25 Memorandum that concluded\nthat no evidence could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties associated with\nEpstein’s and Maxwell’s criminal scheme. Epstein Dkt. No. 6l at l-2. The Government purports\nto seek the unsealing of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the\nconclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. To be clear, we do not agree that there is insufficient\nevidence to support investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes\nand participated in them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases\nhave been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement with Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nsex trafficking.\n\nAs the Court acknouledged, there are “over one thousand victims” of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been\ncompensated for the crimes commited against them, either through the nou-closed Epstein\nVictims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil cases\nfiled that address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking\ncrimes. See Doe I v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Case No. 22-cv-lool9 (S.D.N.Y.), Doe J v.\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-lool8 (S.D.N.Y.); Doe 3 v. Indyke, Case No.\n24-cv-ol2o4 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent any of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-\nconspirators who have thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,\ntheir identities should not be shielded from the public. Though “[t]he privacy interests of innocent\nthird parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v.

That is particularly jarrmg given that she was charged with\nmultiple sex-trafficking offenses and two counts of perjury arising from civil depositions\non these very subjects. To be clear, we do not take issue with Mr. Blanche meeting with\nMs. Maxwell, seemimgly at Maxwell’s request, to obtain gratuitous information she wants\nto provide. Houever, for survivors who bravely testified, the perception that Ms. Maxwell\nis bemg legitimized in public discourse has already resulted im re-traumatization.\n\ne ‘Transfer to a Louer-Security Facility: Maxwell’s recent move to a louer-security prison\nhas further eroded the victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities. The\ntransfer was made without prior notice to the victims, without opportunity to object, and\nwithout explanation—actions they see as extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of\nulterior purposes.\n\ne Lack of Consultation on Unsealing: The government sought the unsealing of grand jury\nmaterials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a\nstep required by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.).\nThat case, litigated pro bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose\nprecisely because the government previously violated the rights of many of these very\nsame victims. It is especially troubling that, despite the outcome of that litigation, the\ngovernment has once again proceeded m a manner that disregards the victums’ rights—\nsuggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken hold. This omission\nreinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the current\nadministration.\n\ne Concrete Fear of Clemency: Survivors are acutely concerned that unsealing, coupled with\nthe transfer and Ms. Maxwell’s public platform, may be a prelude to clemency. The risk\nof a pardon or commutation exacerbates safety concerns in derogation of § 377l (a)(l),\n\n; and threatens severe psychological harm, including triggering trauma responses.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l8 of 27\n\nHonorable Paul A.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'!

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019500.jpg": "OGsedl ZADAeO SBOs ATT thd WARE 2o2 F i627 /PagPeyefisl ab4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2ol9), ensures\nappropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.\n\nIn contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the\ngovernment has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be alloued to\ndisclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the\npublic record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, houever, advances no compelling\nprivacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who\nhave already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil\nsuits in their oun name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public\nrecord in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or\nposting comments under their oun names on social media. The government’s proposed\nrestriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these\nindividuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to\nconduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s\nbehalf.\n\n* * *\nApp.o4l\nDOJ-OGR-oool95oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019512.jpg": "Caseabe o-6l3oo33o4dNn edb ed meMeZ2g2 o2 Filkese727/PagPagefil2sf l3\n\nc) Shall be reviewed by the Defendant solely in\nthe presence of Defense Counsel;\n\nd) Shall not be possessed outside the presence\nof Defense Counsel, or maintained, by the Defendant;\n\ne) Shall be made available for inspection by\nDefense Counsel and the Defendant, under the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of law\nenforcement officers or employees; and\n\n£) Shall not be copied or otherwise duplicated\nby Defense Counsel or the Defendant during such inspections.\n\nl6.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019519.jpg": "CGsedl AZADA SBos ATT (hdc WAG 262 F i627 28/PAg KQei5| B57\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial.

See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\ninternational travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool987o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019908.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8ooB8oHAEN ISSCuUMEnt /2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPagee26ol9\nevidence and witness testimony, will conclusively establish that the defendant groomed the victims\nfor sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein.!\n\nThe defendant’s motion alludes to defenses in this case, all of which are legal or procedural\nin nature, and none of which pass muster, let alone counsel in favor of bail. To begin with, the\nnotion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida\n(“SDFL”) is absurd. That agreement affords her no <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in this District, for at least three\nreasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it as a third-party\nbeneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights\nunder the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement\nshe was not a party to and that does not even identify her by name could possibly be invoked to\nbar her prosecution. Second, and equally important, the NPA does not bind the Southern District\nof New York, which was not a party to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.”)); United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n(2d Cir. 2olo). This rule applies even when the text of the agreement refers to the signing party\nas the “Government.” Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672.\n\nThird, and perhaps most important, even assuming the NPA could be read to protect this\ndefendant and bind this Office, which are both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment\n' Additionally, and beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just the past week,\nand in response to the charges against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) and the U.S. Atorney’s Office have been in touch with additional\nindividuals who have expressed a willingness to provide information regarding the defendant. The\nGovernment is in the process of receiving and reviewing this additional evidence, which has the\npotential to make the Government’s case even stronger.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020102.jpg": "Casmai@Oicb8oRSoATbht DocumheiWeo , FIGE€SlBade4Bayel Spf 4\n\nArticle 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, l996 between the United\nStates of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition\nof any of its nationals, but the Executive Pouer of the United States has the right to do so at its\ndiscretion if it deems it appropriate.”\n\nIn application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under\nFrench law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American\njudicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to\nFrance.\n\nIt should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the\nUnited States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the\nterms of the Law of March 9, 2oo4 transposing the framework decision of June l3, 2oo2 on the\nEuropean arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused\non the sole ground of his French nationality.\n\nThis principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the\nEuropean judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between\nthe Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the\nMember States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these\nStates in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the\nmember states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising\nfrom the European Convention for the <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and\nfrom the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).\n\nIn any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from\nwhich France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.\n\nOffice for the International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nPhilippe JAEGLE\n[signature]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020126.jpg": "Casmt2o4c68oRB8o.4obht Docume WA82 , PIEASB2Baoe6Payel 4.of 4\nanother state*; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> in\nthe United Kingdom’; or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK\nnational security'®.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel4 of 9l\n\nlo/o7/2o2o | 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her\nlawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an\nin-person atorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers\ncategorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff\nbased on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no\nviews as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of\neither sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure\nthat the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in\nconfidential atorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that\nobligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the\ndefenses first leter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to shou cause why\nthe Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted\nin part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to\ncertain questions about the April 24, 2o2l incident and the procedures in place to\nensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020501.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel5 of 92\n\nlo/o7/2o2o 62 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 6o Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court approve the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure of these Materials...

This\nCourts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the defendant is given an\nopportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential atorney-client\ncommunications, and prepare for trial.

No. l42-l at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to\nand deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2ool and 2oo7.\n\nMaxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the\noffenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase\n“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in\nwhat?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who\nconspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those\noffenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses commited by Epstein\nfrom 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office\ninvestigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation.\n\nThe Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.\nThose charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from\ndepositions in 2ol6, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell nou\nconcedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in its\nentirety, perjury counts and all.\n\nThe Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope. The Sl\nsuperseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between l994 and l997, some\nfour years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the\nNPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes commited\nbefore the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation.\nMaxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the\noffenses charged in the Sl superseding indictment.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020814.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel96 of 2o8\ncase focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be\nclear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in\nCosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.\n\nAfter considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and leter of supplemental\nauthority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April l6, 2o2l Opinion & Order. Under\nSecond Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nNew York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment.\n\nI. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>\napplies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal\noffense.” United States v. Dixon, 5o9 U.S. 688, 696 (l993). “A defendant may only raise a\nDouble Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘atached’) sometime\nbefore the alleged ‘second’ prosecution.” United States v. Podde, lo5 F.3d 8l3, 8l6 (2d Cir.\nl997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the\ndefendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (l978); Morris v. Reynolds,\n264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2ool). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the\nGovernment is free to commence a prosecution.\n\nMaxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.\nShe concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never\ncharged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She\nagreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal\nconsequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020990.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel64 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment §f] l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment | l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.*\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect interstate\ncommerce. S2 Indictment {| 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Jd.\n4] 23. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: ae Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o99o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020997.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l4 of 45\nsexual conduct outside of New York as relevant to Count Three because it tended to establish the\nexistence of a conspiracy and of the Defendant and Epstein’s intent to abuse the victims in New\nYork. In sum, the same locations—particularly Florida—were part of the Government’s case for\nboth counts. And over time, a conspiracy’s “shifting emphasis in the location of operations\ndo[es] not necessarily require a finding of more than one conspiracy.” Eppelito, 543 F.3d at 48\n(quoting Jones, 482 F.3d at 72). This factor therefore favors the Defendant or, at least, is neutral.\n\nCommon overt acts. The Government correctly notes that the overt acts provided to the\njury for Counts Three and Five are distinct. See Jury Charge, Dkt. No. 565 at 49-5o. This factor\ntherefore tips touard the Government—but only slightly. A number of the overt acts listed for\nCount Three could have been prosecuted under Count Five but for the fact that l8 U.S.C. § l59l,\nthe Trafficking Victims <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act, was not enacted until 2ooo. See Gov. Br. at 28. That\nsome identical overt acts were not listed for both conspiracies is therefore more a function of\nlegal timing than an indication of two distinct conspiracies. Cf’ Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226,\nat *l2.\n\nInterdependence. Counts Three and Five are not interdependent because the success or\nfailure of one conspiracy is independent of the success or failure of the other. See Macchia, 35\nF.3d at 67l. In other words, the success of the Defendant and Epstein’s scheme to abuse Carolyn\nfrom 2ool to 2oo4 was not made more or less likely by the prior success or failure to abuse Jane,\nAnnie, or any other underage girl. This factor, houever, makes litle difference in the final\nanalysis if “what was ultimately proven was one common conspiracy.” Maslin, 356 F.3d at l97.\n\nThe Government’s theory at trial. The Second Circuit has instructed district courts to\nconsider not only the enumerated Korfant factors but to consider the entire record. See id. at\nl96; United States v. Olmeda, 46l F.3d 27l, 282 (2d Cir. 2oo6).

The absence\nof the phrase “in this District” from the co-conspirator immunity provision\ntherefore compels the inference that the parties did not intend to so limit its reach.\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to\nobtain a global resolution that would, among other things, provide maximum\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for any alleged co-conspirators.

But Landgraf’s “presumption against retroactive\nlegislation,” which “is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,” 5ll U.S. at 265,\napplies with even stronger force in the criminal context.

The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities.

The Adam Walsh Child <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021316.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel44 of 258\nSA-l42\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\n\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021327.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l53 3536o38, Pagel55 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l53 of 348\nflexibility to decline to bring a particular charge based on a “good faith doubt” that the law or\nevidence supports the charge.\n2. Department Policy Relating to Deportation of Criminal Aliens\nOn April 28, l995, the Atorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors\nentitled “Deportation of Criminal Aliens,” directing federal prosecutors to actively and directly\nbecome involved in the process of removing criminal aliens from the United States. In pertinent\npart, this memorandum notes that prosecutors can make a major contribution to the expeditious\ndeportation of criminal aliens by effectively using available prosecution tools for dealing with\nalien defendants. These tools include (l) stipulated administrative deportation orders in\nconnection with plea agreements; (2) deportation as a condition of supervised release under\nl8 U.S.C. § 3853(d); and (3) judicial deportation orders pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § l252a(d). The\nmemorandum further directs:\nAll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless\nextraordinary circumstances exist. Accordingly, absent such\ncircumstances, Federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of\ndeportable alien defendants in whatever manner is deemed most\nappropriate in a particular case. Exceptions to this policy must have\nthe writen approval of the United States Atorney.\nSee also USAM § 9-73.52o. A “criminal alien” is a foreign national who has been convicted of a\ncrime.!°°\nStipulated administrative deportation orders can be based “on the conviction for an offense\nto which the alien will plead guilty,” provided that the offense is one of those enumerated in\n8 U.S.C. § l25l as an offense that causes an alien to be deported. Under 8 U.S.C.\n§ l25l(a)(2)(A)G@), any alien who is convicted of a crime of “moral turpitude” within five years\nafter the date of entry (or lo years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident\nstatus), and is either sentenced to confinement or confined to prison for one year or longer, is\ndeportable.\nC. Case Law\nl. Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn many occasions, the Supreme Court has discussed the breadth of the prosecutor’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether and whom to prosecute. In Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357\n(l978), the Court considered the propriety of a prosecutor’s threat during plea negotiations to seek\nmore serious charges against the accused if the accused did not plead guilty to the offense\noriginally charged. The defendant, Hayes, opted not to plead guilty to the original offense, and\nl96 According to the U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, “The term ‘criminal alien’ refers to aliens who have\nbeen convicted of one or more crimes, whether in the United States or abroad, prior to interdiction by the U.S. Border\nPatrol.” See U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span>, CBP Enforcement Statistics,\nCriminal Alien Statistics Fiscal Year 2o2o, available at htps:/(www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-\nstatistics/criminal-alien-statistics.\nl27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021328.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON EA 3536o38, Pagel56 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l54 of 348\nthe prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and\nsentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his\nconviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a\nlegitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his\nconviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted\nimpermissible vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance\nof the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty\nplea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining\nprocess.” /d. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been\ncommited, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a\ngrand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that\nselectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable\nstandard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.\n\nThese principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 47o U.S. 598 (l985), a case\ninvolving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves\nas having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed\nthat the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were\nbeing punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this\nargument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and\nthat the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an\nunjustifiable standard. /d. at 6o7-o8. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to\nhave a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.\n\nIn Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 4o9 (l976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state\nprosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § l983 for violation\nof the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others\nhad unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a\nprosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the\njudicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit\nfor damages. Jd. at 43o-3l. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (lst Cir. l992), the court applied\nImbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the\navailability of immunity for the decision to charge, it becomes even more important that\nsymmetrical <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 4l (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\nFinally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 47o U.S. 82l (l985), the\nSupreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not\nreviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 5oo-7o6.\n\n2.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> from “the accused,” not a suspect.

Here, Maxwell has failed to\nmake the requisite shouing: she is not named in the\nprovision naming four potential co-conspirator\n(A.l78), and she has offered no evidence that the par-\nties to the NPA intended to confer a benefit on her spe-\ncifically.

The NPA’s Terms Bind Only the USAO-\n\nSDFL\n\nEven if Maxwell had a right to invoke the NPA’s\nprotections, it would not bar the charges in this case.\nBy its terms, the NPA only applies to prosecutions\nbrought by the USAO-SDFL. The agreement was\nsigned “on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta,\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida.” (A.l75). And in exchange for Epstein’s plea in\nstate court, the USAO-SDFL agreed to defer “prosecu-\ntion in this District’—that is, the Southern District of\nFlorida. (A.l75). The USAO-SDFL further promised\nthat no prosecution by “the Federal Bureau of Investi-\ngation and the U.S. Atorney’s Office ... will be insti-\ntuted in this District.” (A.l75). An agreement by the\nUSAO-SDFL not to prosecute Epstein in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida is an agreement intended to apply\nonly to the USAO-SDFL and only in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of Florida. Moreover, the agreement was signed\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l678\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021681.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page34 of 93\n2l\n\nthe prosecution of co-conspirators without clearly say-\ning so.” (A.l42).3\n\nMaxwell also points to the NPA provision stating\nthat “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and\nfederal criminal liability.” (A.l75). Based on that\nstatement, Maxwell argues that Epstein’s purpose in\nnegotiating the NPA was to “obtain a global resolution\nthat would, among other things, provide maximum\n<span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> for any alleged co-conspirators.” (Br.34).\nBut the cited provision only says that Epstein sought\nto resolve “his” liability, not anyone else’s. Further-\nmore, under Maxwell’s reading, Epstein bargained for\na truly “global” resolution only for his co-conspirators,\nand limited his oun “global” resolution expressly to the\nUSAO-SDFL. There is no reason to believe that Ep-\nstein expressly sought and obtained broader immunity\nfor his co-conspirators than he did for himself. (See\nalso SAlo7 n.l25 (observing that a supervisor at the\nUSAO-SDFL “pointed out that the NPA was not a\n\n3 Maxwell also relies on draft plea agreements\nwhich “expressly defined the term ‘United States’ as\nlimited to” USAO-SDFL. Those plea agreements—\nwhich differed significantly from the NPA—also use\nboth the terms “United States” and “United States At-\ntorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida,” in-\ncluding using the USAO-SDFL term expressly in the\ncontext of the co-conspirator provision. (See, e.g.,\nDkt.l42, Ex. F at 2). This point only highlights the par-\nties’ understanding at all times that their negotiations\nmerely bound the USAO-SDFL, and not the entire fed-\neral government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l68l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021683.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page36 of 93\n\n23\n\nFlorida, such as the USAO-SDFL’s “contact with wit-\n\nnesses in New York.” (Br.38). These disparate and un-\n\nconnected events do not shou that the USAO-SDFL\n\nacted on behalf of the entire federal government when\n\nentering into the NPA, or that Epstein understood the\n\nUSAO-SDFL to be doing so.\n\nMaxwell also advances several arguments atempt-\ning to minimize or side-step this Court’s precedent. For\nexample, Maxwell argues that Annabi applies only if\nthe charges in the indictment are “sufficiently distinct”\nfrom the counts resolved by the earlier agreement.\n(Br.3o-33 (quoting 77l F.2d at 672)). Not so. The rele-\nvant portion of Annabi concerned an argument by the\ndefendants that in seeking to have a plea agreement\nin the Eastern District of New York bar the pending\ncharges in the Southern District of New York, they\nwere “seeking only the same <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> accorded by\nthle Double Jeopardy] Clause.” 77l F.2d at 672. This\nCourt rejected that argument, reasoning that even if\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding\nthat the defendants were “never in jeopardy” on those\ncharges in the Eastern District), the defendants would\nnot be entitled to relief because the pending charges\n“extended for an additional two years” and thus were\n“not the same as the charges that were dismissed.” Id.\nThus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered\nunless it affirmatively appears that the agreement\ncontemplates a broader restriction,” id.—applies only\nif the charges are sufficiently distinct. And as Judge\nNathan recognized, “no subsequent Second Circuit\ncase applying Annabi has so held.” (A.l9l).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l683\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021690.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page43 of 93\n3o\n\nlo8-66, at 54 (2oo3)).

Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details\nsurrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at l66. The Court also noted the absence of a\ntextual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at l66\nn.7o. The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative\nhistory, namely, the inclusion of Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) in a statute intended to “afford\nminor victims of crime the greatest degree of <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span>.” Id. at l66.\n\nThe Court contrasted Section 3l42(f)(l)(E) with another portion of the Act that\ncontains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because\nthat text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-\nphasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id. (quoting l8\nU.S.C. § 3l82(f)(l) (discussing “a case that involves ...a crime of violence . . .”); see\nid. at l62-65.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lol, o3/lo/2o24, 36l4237, Page2 of 2\nCatherine O’Hagan Wolfe\nMarch lo, 2o23\nPage 2 of 2\nThe same principles apply to the statute of limitations at issue here.

That statute covers an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse...\nof a child,” l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), which similarly “suggests factual details sur-\nrounding the charged conduct” and lacks language like “has as an element.” And it\nis also part of a statute intended to afford broader protections for minor victims of\ncrimes.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB. False Statements and Lack of Candor\nUnder federal law, “whoever, in any mater within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knouingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document\nknouing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated\nl8 U.S.C. § lool(a)(3). The terms “knouingly and willfully’ mean that the subject acted with knouledge that\nthe conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law. It is not required that the subject was aware of the\nexistence of Section lool.\nUnder BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official\ninvestigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding\nto questions.”\nc Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities\nl. Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for <span class=\"highlight\">protection</span> reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023465.jpg": "The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life, resulting in significant questions being asked\nabout the circumstances of his death, hou it could have been alloued to have happen, and most\nimportantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged\ncrimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems <span class=\"highlight\">Protection</span> Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate.
