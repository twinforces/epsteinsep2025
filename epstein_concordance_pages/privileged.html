Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with\ndefense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four\nconditions, detailed belou.

Houever, the\nGovernment’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to\nprepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided.

By way of background, that final\nproduction comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized\nfrom Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2ol9. Specifically,\nin July of 2ol9, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in\nAugust of 2ol9, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,\nthe FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then\ninitiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.\n\nIn or about January of 2o2o, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those\ndevices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of\nthat subset of data for potentially <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> materials. In or about February of 2o2o, the privilege\nteam completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February\nof 2o2o, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.\n\nOn June 26, 2o2o, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 9 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nDeprivation of Communication with Family and Friends: The impact of Ms.\nMaxwell’s solitary confinement is aggravated by the deprivation of communication with friends\nand family. She was limited in the number of familial and social calls to a degree far less than\nany other detainee of which we are aware; and far less than even those who have been convicted\nof crimes and held in the same facility.\n\nCompromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID-l9,\nrestrictions have been placed on exercise of atorney-client relationship for all inmates but\nseemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,\nresulting in missed legal calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conference has been\nscheduled for Ms. Maxwell during the entirety of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been\nrepeatedly denied even when confirmed by the Federal Defenders.\n\nAll of Ms. Maxwell’s CorrLinks emails — all legal correspondence between Ms. Maxwell\nand counsel - have been deleted, well before the l8o-day period in which they may be purged.\nDuring in-person legal conferences, Ms. Maxwell has not been permited to physically handle\nand review legal documents provided by counsel. Rather, counsel must hold each page against\nthe plastic partition requiring Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of\napproximately four feet through a cloudy plastic shield. This method of discovery review in a\ncase involving hundreds of thousands of documents consumes the majority of a time-limited\nlegal conference. It is painstakingly slou and, often, impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Ms. Maxwell is denied water or food and the use of toilet facilities during\nlegal visits. She has been told that if she uses the toilet, the conference will be suspended while\nshe is searched, returned to her unit, and then brought back to the visiting room. This process is\ntime-consuming and limits the duration of the legal conference.\n\nIn advance of each meeting, officers review her legal materials, slouly and deliberately,\nand appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> information rather\nthan conducting a routine security check. In addition to experiencing difficulty reviewing\nelectronic discovery because files do not open, the officer delivering a hard drive last week\nappeared to intentionally let it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.\n\nWhile meeting with counsel, guards set up a tripod with a camera focused on Ms.\nMaxwell during the entirety of the legal conference. When counsel inquired why the conference\nwas being recorded, the officer claimed the camera was not recording. When counsel inquired\nwhy the camera was being focused on the legal conference, the officer responded that Ms.\nMaxwell must be watched at all times.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese arbitrary and onerous restrictions imposed on Ms. Maxwell are contrary to prison\nrules and protocols, are not imposed on other inmates, and are uterly disproportionate to her\ndetention. At no time has Ms. Maxwell been deemed a threat to herself or others or posed any\ndisciplinary issues. Ironically, she has achieved two of the highest certifications offered at the\nMDC: suicide counselor and teacher/instructor.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool874\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002019.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 4\nCONFIDENTIAL/<span class=\"highlight\">PRIVILEGED</span>/SEALED\nNovember l9, 2o2o\nDear Judge Nathan,\nI respectfully submit this leter in support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail application.\nHistory\nMO\nee\nMCC\n4.

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Entry l53 in the log identified “email and leter\n' The privilege log was produced in response to an interrogatory, served by Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel on BSF, as counsel for Virginia Roberts, which asked in relevant part that they\n“Tijdentify each Communication, including the transmission of any Document, that You or Your\nAtorneys have had with any local, state or federal law enforcement agent or agency, whether in\nthe United States or any other country, whether in Your capacity as a purported victim, witness,\nor perpetrator of any criminal activity, and whether as a juvenile or as an adult, including without\nlimitation:\n\na. the date of any such Communication;\n\nb. the form of any such Communication, whether oral or writen and if writen, the format\n\nof any such Communication;\n\nc. the identities of all persons involved in the Communication, including the identity of\n\nthe law enforcement agency with whom the agent is or was affiliated;\n\nd. the case number associated with any such Communication;\n\ne. the subject mater of any such Communication;\n\nf. the disposition of any case associated with any such Communication, irrespective of\n\nwhether the mater was sealed, expunged or later dismissed.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3974\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 Filed o4/23/2l Page4ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Maxwell,” the\nproduction from the government to Ms. Maxwell does not contain these 57 documents reflecting\ncommunications between these lawyers and a “law enforcement entity.” Only after Ms. Maxwell\nfiled her pre-trial motions did the government produce a few of its communications with BSF\nand their co-counsel from 2ol6. The peculiar failure of the government to produce these items\nin connection with the “entire” BSF file has yet to be explained. Clearly, BSF knew what the\nterms meant when it used them to block the production of this information in the civil litigation\nand it should not be alloued to profess confusion or ignorance here.\n\nThe cases cited by BSF are not helpful to its cause. For example, the court in United\nStates v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2o2o),\nquashed the subpoena because it did “not satisfy the initial requirement of relevance.” In United\nStates v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3), the defendant requested\n“any and all writings and records” related to the NYPD's contact with a particular confidential\nwitness who, according to the defendant, provided relevant information. The subpoena was\nunlimited in time or scope and, to the extent a time or scope were determined, production of the\ninformation was limited by l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. Jd. at 5l3.\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, No. S9 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 2, 2oo8), involved a subpoena served by the Defendant on the Metropolitan Detention\n? Judge McMahon described the subpoena as a “general subpoena...I mean, everything that’s in\nBoies Schiller’s files, other than <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> documents, which of course you don’t exclude from\nyour subpoena.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3975\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

[the]inmate at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center Brooklyn from about April 2oo6 to the Present.” Of course, the court found the\nsubpoena did not call for relevant evidence and was also deficient under all three Nixon prongs.\nId. at 5.\n\nNor does this Court’s decision in United States v.

First, BSF admits that these communications occurred. Second, the\ncommunications about trying to get Ms. Maxwell indicted were “prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation or for trial,” admiting both relevance and admissibility. BSF does not and cannot\nplausibly explain hou a joint effort to procure a civil opponent’s indictment is protected by the\nwork product doctrine. BSF’s ipse dixit fails because the\n\n“burden of justifying the application of the work product doctrine is on the asserting\n\nparty, and the burden is a heavy one because privileges are neither lightly created\n\nnor expansively construed.

Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is submited in response to the government’s leter of June 7, 2o2l, updating\nthe Court concerning Ghislaine Maxwell’s conditions of detention. This leter, like the ones\nbefore it, contains second- and third-hand information and presents a one-sided review, giving\nthe Court and the public the false impression that Ms. Maxwell is detained under favorable and\n<span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> conditions. Each time, the defense feels compelled to respond to give the Court and\nthe public a complete and accurate picture of Ms. Maxwell’s unacceptable conditions of\nconfinement. This is not the purpose that these updates were designed to serve. Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that any further updates be limited to changed circumstances.\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell can personally atest to many problems that are not reported to\nthe government, not conveyed to the Court, and not docketed for public review. The follouing is\na sample of new and recurring problems:\n\n= Last week, raw sewage permeated Ms. Maxwell’s isolation cell, necessitating her\nremoval to another cell.\n\n= Vermin droppings fell from air vents.\n\n= Guards nou prevent Ms. Maxwell from removing legal documents from the\n\nvideoconferencing room for review during the lunch hour.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004745.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 2 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\n=\" On Sunday, guards initially refused to allou Ms. Maxwell to bring a notebook to a\nscheduled in-person legal conference, disbelieving her assertion that it contained legal\nmaterial. A guard reviewed the contents of the notebook, reading pages containing\nconfidential and <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> work product, before permiting Ms. Maxwell to bring the\nnotebook to the legal visit.\n\n= Contrary to previous legal conferences, neither counsel nor Ms. Maxwell were permited\nto have any water in the individual conference room during Sunday’s four-hour legal\nconference.\n\n= Three to six guards watched Ms. Maxwell and counsel for the entirety of the conference.\n\n= Neither counsel nor Ms. Maxwell were permited to use the most rudimentary of earbuds\nto listen to audio files on counsel’s laptop, requiring the volume to be raised to maximum\nlevel. Ms. Maxwell cannot have <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> communications with her counsel and\nadequately prepare for trial if the prison guards can hear what she is reviewing and\ndiscussing with counsel.\n\n= The prison guards ordered counsel to reposition her portfolio, which was being used to\nshield glare from the plexiglass divider separating counsel from Ms. Maxwell to permit\ncounsel to have a clearer view of the laptop, because the portfolio was restricting the\nguards’ view of counsel.\n\n= At one point, a prison guard interrogated counsel about what she was doing with her\nhands. (Counsel was bloting a bleeding finger with note paper.)\n\n» At the conclusion of Sunday’s legal visit, counsel requested that the guards inventory Ms.\nMaxwell’s documents in the presence of counsel to avoid the problem that ensued\nfollouing the April 24\" visit when counsel was falsely accused of improperly leaving\ndocuments with Ms. Maxwell.\n\n= Yesterday, the monitor which has been used for video conferencing for months was\nrepositioned to a distance further away from Ms. Maxwell impacting her ability to review\nscreen-shared documents with counsel. The request was immediately denied.\n\n= Today’s videoconferencing was reduced by 9o minutes while changes were made to\nMDC equipment. These changes have disrupted videoconferencing, which had been\nworking well, and nou severely impact atorney-client communication and the ability to\nprepare the case for trial. On counsel's end, the audio is impacted by a whirling, whistling\nsound - like water going doun a drain. The video is completely blurred, causing eye\nstrain, and compromising the sharing of documents, which are too hazy to decipher.\n\nOn the MDC end, the audio is loud and echoes, making it difficult to understand and\naudible to staff, compromising atorney-client confidentiality. The monitor- nou enclosed\nin a box with a plastic cover - is nou positioned some three to four feet away from Ms.\nMaxwell. This distance impacts Ms. Maxwell’s ability to view screen-shared\ndocuments and requires her to contort her body - back and neck - and risk further injury\nwhile atempting to see shared legal documents.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4745\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3oo _ Filed o6/l5/2l Page 3 of 32\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

There were no problems with VTCs with\nthe exception of when the MDC placed the VTC monitor inside a box with a screen, which severely\nimpacted Ms. Maxwell’s ability to see counsel and documents shoun to her. That issue, which arose on\nJune l4, 2o2l, was resolved between defense counsel and the MDC.\n\nHouever, on August 6, 2o2l, MDC Legal sent counsel an email stating that starting Monday\n(August 9\") we could no longer use defense counsel’s WebEx platform for the VTCs, and instead had to\nuse any of four Zoom access codes provided by the MDC. When questioned why the platform was\nbeing changed from WebEx to Zoom, MDC Legal stated the VTC platform was changed due to\ncomplaints made by Ms. Maxwell. Upon information and belief, the complaints concerned visual\nevidence that someone on MDC’s end of the WebEx connection, other than Ms. Maxwell, appeared on\nthe screen as a VTC participant called “NER/BRO,” adjusted the volume during the VTC, and moved\nthe viewing box used to view documents on the screen. During the past several weeks, interruption in\nMs. Maxwell’s VTC signal and bandwidth suggested that her connection was split, causing her VTC\nsessions to go in and out, and her screen often turned green and became blurry. No other participants\nexperienced such disruption.\n\nWhen Ms. Maxwell raised these concerns to various staff members, no one seemed surprised.\nThe fact that MDC immediately provided a “more secure” link (in their words) suggests there was some\ntype of breach or interference with the atorney-client VTC which impinged upon confidentiality of\n<span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> atorney-client communication and is placing an on-going chill on communication between\nMs. Maxwell and her defense team.\n\nIt is my understanding that the new MDC Zoom platform does not preclude third parties who\nhave the access information to the Zoom “Courtrooms” from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally)\nwith Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> communication.

This breach was\nreported to, and I believe witnessed by, MDC staff, including an MDC technician named Leon\nwho is tasked with dealing with Ms. Maxwell’s electronics issues.\n\nBy email dated August l2\" to MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, I reported\nthat this purported breach severely impacts confidential <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> atorney-client\ncommunication and is especially concerning in this high-profile case. I requested that the VTC\nrevert to the original WebEx platform controlled by defense counsel.\n\nIn an email response, dated August l3\", MDC Legal stated:\n\nThere was a miscommunication on our end internally. There was no\n\nbreach. The address provided was a very secure line, houever, it was\n\nalready one being used. We are creating a line as secure as possible.\n\nWe are hoping for this to be complete by the 9:3o scheduled call, but I\n\ncannot confirm it will be ready by then.\n\nOn August l6\", I again emailed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied,\nrequesting clarification as to why the VTC is still not proceeding, as it did not on Friday, and\nrenewed my request that VTCs be reinstated on defense counsel’s WebEx platform because the\nsubstituted Zoom platform is not secure and seems to have caused cancellation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nVTCs. I also informed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, that during my in-person\nvisit with Ms. Maxwell on Saturday, August l4\", both Ms. Maxwell and I were told we could\nnot pass documents. This restriction frustrated and affected the productivity of a four-hour visit.\n\nIn a reply email later that day, MDC Legal stated:\n\nPlease understand this is not a simple process and may take a few days.\n\nWith that said you have had access to your client via telephone.\n\nAdditionally, as you have had weekend visit on weekend with Ms. Maxwell,\n\nwe can gladly arrange for the same on any day moving forward.\n\nAs far as your weekend legal visit- the staff who did not allou the\n\npassing of legal documents have been informed of the appropriate\n\ninstructions.\n\nThe restrictions placed on Ms. Maxwell, including limiting the quantity of legal\ndocuments she may bring to the VTC room or day room and the prohibition on review of\ndocuments during in-person legal conferences- coupled with problems with conducting\nconfidential legal conference VTCs - has limited Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial. Legal\ncalls do not suffice because we cannot share documents. For example, Ms. Maxwell received\nnew discovery today and yet again a significant amount is not viewable on the hardware and\nsoftware provided by the government. Because we cannot share documents, that discovery\nremains unviewable by Ms. Maxwell.

I requested that the VTC\nrevert to the original WebEx platform controlled by defense counsel.\n\nIn an email response, dated August l3\", MDC Legal stated:\n\nThere was a miscommunication on our end internally. There was no\n\nbreach. The address provided was a very secure line, houever, it was\n\nalready one being used. We are creating a line as secure as possible.\n\nWe are hoping for this to be complete by the 9:3o scheduled call, but I\n\ncannot confirm it will be ready by then.\n\nOn August l6\", I again emailed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied,\nrequesting clarification as to why the VTC is still not proceeding, as it did not on Friday, and\nrenewed my request that VTCs be reinstated on defense counsel’s WebEx platform because the\nsubstituted Zoom platform is not secure and seems to have caused cancellation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nVTCs. I also informed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, that during my in-person\nvisit with Ms. Maxwell on Saturday, August l4\", both Ms. Maxwell and I were told we could\nnot pass documents. This restriction frustrated and affected the productivity of a four-hour visit.\n\nIn a reply email later that day, MDC Legal stated:\n\nPlease understand this is not a simple process and may take a few days.\n\nWith that said you have had access to your client via telephone.\n\nAdditionally, as you have had weekend visit on weekend with Ms. Maxwell,\n\nwe can gladly arrange for the same on any day moving forward.\n\nAs far as your weekend legal visit- the staff who did not allou the\n\npassing of legal documents have been informed of the appropriate\n\ninstructions.\n\nThe restrictions placed on Ms. Maxwell, including limiting the quantity of legal\ndocuments she may bring to the VTC room or day room and the prohibition on review of\ndocuments during in-person legal conferences- coupled with problems with conducting\nconfidential legal conference VTCs - has limited Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.

For example, Ms. Maxwell received\nnew discovery today and yet again a significant amount is not viewable on the hardware and\nsoftware provided by the government.

The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\n<span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page4of8\nkept confidential because it was information the Government “would want to knou” and “Jane\nwould want the government to knou,” (Def. Leter at 2); and (2) any privilege was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the privilege that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the privilege. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\nessential to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be essential to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient relationship. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that relationship\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\ncooperation agreement. Once the cooperation agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page5of8\nto divulge their conversations with counsel about hou significant their atorneys assess the benefits\nof immunity to be.\n\nIn such cases, it is not that these issues are irrelevant to the Government or to the defense.\nThey are highly relevant. But the atorney-client communications are <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, and the\natorney’s advice is not presumptively expected to be shared with the Government because the\nwitness will testify for the Government. Instead, the client makes factual statements about the\nissue—not about the atorney-client communications—which the Government turns over to the\ndefense. See, e.g., In re General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig., 8o F. Supp. 3d 52l, 528\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (“It is well established, houever, that the atorney-client privilege protects\ncommunications rather than information.”). The fact that “certain information might later be\ndisclosed to others does not, by itself, create the factual inference that the communications were\nnot intended to be confidential at the time they were made.” Jd. at 529 (emphasis in original,\ninternal quotation marks omited). In this case, it would have been improper for the Government\nto ask Jane hou Glassman had advised her regarding her decision whether to assist the\nGovernment.”\n\nSecond, Glassman did not waive any privilege over Jane’s communications with him\nthrough his comments to the Government. The reason is that Jane, not Glassman, was holder of\nthe privilege, and it was not Glassman’s to waive. See In re von Bulou, 828 F.2d at loo. And\n? United States v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3), on which the defendant relies (Def.\nLeter at 3), is inapposite. In that case, a company agreed to turn over certain documents to the\nGovernment “before the documents had been prepared.” J/d. at 493. Accordingly, the company\ncould not assert privilege over the documents, because they were made “for the purpose of relaying\ncommunication to a third party.” Jd. There is no reason to believe that Glassman’s legal advice\nto Jane was made with the intent to turn over that legal advice to the Government.\n\nS\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her privilege\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her cooperation with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client relationship into the trial by atempting to use <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout cooperation. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4).

And insofar as the point is to\nimpeach Jane, this statement is of minimal impeachment value. Jane said no when asked whether\nshe knew that “cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit you in your\ncivil litigation against the Epstein estate and Ms. Maxwell.” l2/ol/2l Tr. at 58l; see id. (asking\nthe same question about her knouledge “at any point” regarding Jane’s civil litigation). As of\nAugust l7, 2o2l, the date of the statement from Glassman to the Government, Jane had been paid\nby the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund, and her civil case had been dismissed. And Glassman\nappears to have advised Jane that the civil cases were fully resolved. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 6l9\n(testimony by Jane that she does not have a financial stake in the outcome of this trial).4 At most,\nthen, the statement means that Glassman, at some point in the past, advised Jane that testifying\nwould aid another “case.” And at most, that would impeach Jane by suggesting that, while she\naccurately testified that she did not “knou” that her “cooperation with the government, including\ntestifying,” would benefit her in her civil case or EVCP claim, she had been told that at one point\nin the past.\n\nBy contrast, there is significant risk that admission of the statement would require\nGlassman to divulge further <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> communications with Jane. Glassman’s comment to the\nGovernment is not easily intelligible. Glassman referenced “help[ing] her case,” which is not\nspecifically a reference to civil litigation or her claim with the EVCP, and says that “it,” whatever\nit is, would help that case. (Def. Leter Ex. A). To explain what Glassman is referencing, and\nwhen he gave that advice, he would likely have to provide more content to his advice to Jane and\n* The Government is of course not aware of Glassman’s <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> advice to Jane.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document544_ Filed l2/l4/2l Page2of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Rather than asking these atorneys about their conversations with their\nclients, which are <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, the defendant seeks to elicit testimony about those atorneys’\nconversations with the Government. This end-run around privilege, houever, would only generate\nirrelevant evidence. The victims themselves have testified and been cross-examined about what\nthey do and do not knou or believe. There is no relevance to their lawyers’ conversations with\nthe Government when the defendant has failed to establish the victim’s knouledge of those\nstatements, nor would testimony about those conversations serve as proper impeachment, unless\nthose conversations were in some way communicated to their clients. And that fact has not been\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page2of9\nestablished and cannot be established without infringing on privilege. Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorney’s client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe atorney-client relationship. Cf, e.g., l At’y-Client Privilege in the U.S. § 3:24 (2o2l)\n(“Although atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. ‘The serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.””); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless “required\nby a compelling and legitimate need”); Edebali v.

(noting potential conflict of interest issues that arise if, for instance, “there is likely to be\nsubstantial conflict between the testimony of the client and that of the lawyer”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe defendant seeks to call three atorneys for victims: Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and\nRobert Glassman. For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in\nevidence, is irrelevant or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\nassociated with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, it is\nirrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\nCompensation Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page4of9\n\nl68l-83).\n\ne Scarola was present for Carolyn’s the meetings the Government listed by the defense. (Tr.\n\nl684; Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\ne Carolyn received $2,8o4,ooo from the Epstein Victims Compensation Program, not\ncounting the $446,ooo she had previously received from her claims against Epstein and\n\nSarah Kellen (Tr. l688-89).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant has already obtained through Carolyn much of the testimony it\nanticipates from Scarola. There is no need for Scarola to testify to information already obtained\nfrom Carolyn, and it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.\n\nNearly all of additional testimony the defendant proposes to elicit from Scarola is irrelevant\nand non-impeaching. It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).' It says nothing about Carolyn that Scarola copied counsel for other victims\non an email. (id. at 2). None of that information impeaches Carolyn’s testimony in any way—\nrather, it is entirely consistent with her testimony.”\n\nThe defendant argues this testimony is relevant to “establish the timeline of Carolyn’s\ncooperation with the government and her motive and bias in testifying against Ms. Maxwell, in\nparticular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and uncooperative until there was the prospect\n' The Government would stipulate to the specific dates of meetings between Scarola, Carolyn, and\nthe Government. (See Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\n? The defendant would also elicit from Scarola that, during a 2o2o meeting, Scarola told the\nGovernment that he had shoun Carolyn a picture of the Epstein associate with the same name as\nJane, but Carolyn could not identify the person at the time. But the defendant did not ask Carolyn\nabout that person, so this testimony would not impeach Carolyn—to the extent it is not <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of9\nof a payout from the EVCP.” (Def. Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o. And if it did, it\nwould serve simply as an end-run around the information the defendant would prefer to elicit, but\nwhich is protected by privilege: the substance of Scarola and Carolyn’s conversations about the\nEVCP and cooperation with the Government.\n\nFinally, even if there were some probative value to those details, it is substantially\noutweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion associated with calling Carolyn’s counsel to the\nstand. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page6eof9\nB. Brad Edwards\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Brad Edwards, counsel for Kate, to say that he provided a\nU-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This testimony, too, would not be\n<span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, but it is irrelevant and improper impeachment.\n\nKate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for\na U-Visa. (Tr. l279, l287, l3oo). She acknouledged that Edwards likely atended the meeting,\nbut did not recall whether he provided a U-Visa form to the Government (Tr. l3oo). Kate also\nexplained that her plan is simply to renew her current visa, and that the Government has made no\npromises to assist her. (Tr. l2o7-o8, l295).\n\nThe fact that Edwards provided the Government with a U-Visa application form during a\nmeeting with Kate is not relevant or impeaching of Kate. Rather, it is entirely consistent with\nKate’s testimony—specifically, that she made an inquiry about a U-Visa but was not sure whether\nher lawyer provided the Government with a U-Visa form. And the fact that her lawyer provided\nthe Government with a U-Visa form is not “pouerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Leter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence\nof Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.\nSecond, it is not “pouerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknouledged asking the Government\nabout a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete\nU-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s oun testimony. It does\nnot shou, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she\ncontinues to seek one nou, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind\nabout her immigration status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the anticipated\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page8of9\nwould serve no proper purpose.?\n\nFinally, Glassman’s conversations with the EVCP do not impeach Jane’s testimony. The\ndefendant would call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher setlement from the\nEVCP. As the Court explained when the defendant raised this very issue at a break on December\nl, “there are personal knouledge questions in issue.” (Tr. 489). On cross, defense counsel asked\nJane if she knew whether her atorney asked the EVCP for more money, and she said she did not\nknou. (Tr. 558). Today, as on December l, evidence of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP\n(or the defendant) go to Jane’s bias only if Jane was aware of them. Jane testified that she was not\naware of them, and the evidence the defendant would elicit from Glassman would not cure that\ndefect. It is therefore improper impeachment. And for Glassman, as for Scarola and Edwards, the\nsuggestion that the jury should infer that Jane and Glassman had certain <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> conversations\nthat affect Jane’s knouledge from the fact that Glassman had other exchanges with other\nindividuals is more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nIl. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,\nBrad Edwards, and Robert Glassman.\n\n3 The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges with the Government that “do not repeat\nor refer to statements by Jane” are not <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>. (Def. Leter at 8). Glassman’s statements in the\nemail are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the\nlion king,” which are irrelevant. And the prosecutor’s statements can only be relevant to the extent\nthat Jane was aware of them. But the defense has not established that fact, in part because the\ndefense framed its questions on cross to call for <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> information. (See, e.g., Tr. 5ll (“The\ngovernment suggested to you that perhaps you meant to say The Lion King movie through your\natorney to you; correct?” (emphasis added))).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo838l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 - Filed o2/ll/22 Page5of7\nOrder, via email on or before February l6, 2o22.

The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention.

Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nMay 2, 2o22\nTo Honorable Judge Nathan:\nMy name is Christine Malina Maxwell. | am one of Ghislaine’s sisters. I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page l8 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage l8\n\nF. Compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThree of the motions argue that compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable\nand oppressive because the accusers were guaranteed confidentiality under the EVCP Protocol.\nEVCP Mot. at 9-l2; Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at 2-3. The government does not\nmake such an argument. Gov. Mot. at l-6. Some motions even imply that the confidentiality of\nthe materials is reason enough to quash the subpoena. Accuser-2 Mot. at 4-6; Witness-3 Mot. at\n2-3,\n\nFirst, even if the materials are confidential, this Court cannot quash the subpoena on that\nbasis alone. Rule l7 addresses the process for subpoenaing “personal or confidential information\nabout a victim.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). If confidential materials couldn’t be subpoenaed, Rule\nl7(c)(3) would be superfluous.\n\nIn fact, under the express language of Rule l7, the only difference between a subpoena\nfor confidential information and a subpoena for non-confidential information is that the former\ncan be issued “‘only by court order” with notice to the victim. Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). The\nterms of Rule l7 do not require a heightened justification before a defendant can subpoena\nconfidential information, and they do not demand special treatment for motions to quash when\nconfidential information is at issue. Id.°\n\n® Courts in this district have even authorized defense subpoenas when the information\nsought is arguably <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>. E.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, 753 F. Supp. 2d 3l7, 324-25\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (denying motion to quash defense subpoena for tax returns even though the\nreturns might be <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span>, saying “cases demonstrate . . . a potential exception to the tax return\nprivilege where, as here, the interests in truth and a criminal defendant’s rights are both\nimplicated’’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 47 of lo6 5l\nLBTCMAX2 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim\n\nl (In open court)\n\n2 MS.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and <span class=\"highlight\">privileged</span> material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023013.jpg": "DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nOFFICE OF\nPROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY\nREPORT\nInvestigation into the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s\nResolution of Its 2oo6-2oo8 Federal Criminal Investigation of\nJeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation\nNovember 2o2o\nNOTE: THIS REPORT CONTAINS SENSITIVE, <span class=\"highlight\">PRIVILEGED</span>, AND PRIVACY\nACT PROTECTED INFORMATION.
