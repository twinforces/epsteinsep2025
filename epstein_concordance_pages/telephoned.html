Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters.

During this conversation,\nCosby offered to continue assisting Constand if she still desired to work in sports\nbroadcasting.

Cosby asked Constand to meet him in person to discuss these maters further,\nand told her that he would have someone contact her to set up the meeting. As with the\nprevious call, Cosby again refused to identify the pills that he had provided to Constand\non the night of the alleged assault.\n\nWithin days of filing the police report, Constand received two telephone messages\nfrom people associated with Cosby. The first message was from one of Cosby’s\nassistants, calling on Cosby’s behalf to invite Constand and her mother to Cosby’s\nupcoming performance in Miami, Florida. Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the\noffer and did not provide the requested information. Constand then received a message\nfrom one of Cosby’s atorneys, who stated that he was calling to discuss the creation of\na trust that Cosby wanted to set up in order to provide financial assistance for Constand’s\neducation.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis <span class=\"highlight\">telephoned</span>\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023889.jpg": "I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nFrom\n\nTo amine N'Diaye, Lee\n\nPlourde\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/25 o6:o4\n\nSubject: I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nFYI,\nInformed by E/W Ops Lieutenant that USMS <span class=\"highlight\">telephoned</span> Lieutenants office inquiring about |/M Epstein's\nsuicide atempt....later received call from E/W OSP #l indicating that the Daily News was asking questions as\nwell...\n\nPage 4o68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024360.jpg": "I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nFrom\n\nTo CE amine N'Diaye, Lee\n\nPlourde\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/25 o6:o4\n\nSubject: I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nFYI,\nInformed by E/W Ops Lieutenant that USMS <span class=\"highlight\">telephoned</span> Lieutenants office inquiring about |/M Epstein's\nsuicide atempt....later received call from E/W OSP #l indicating that the Daily News was asking questions as\nwell...\n\nPage 432o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024367.jpg": "I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nFrom\n\nTo Lamine N'Diaye, Lee\n\nPlourde\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/25 o6:o4\n\nSubject: I/M Epstein, Jeffrey #763 l8-o54\n\nAtachments: TEXT.htm\nFYI,\nInformed by E/W Ops Lieutenant that USMS <span class=\"highlight\">telephoned</span> Lieutenants office inquiring about |/M Epstein's\nsuicide atempt....later received call from E/W OSP #l indicating that the Daily News was asking questions as\nwell...\n\nPage 436l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031424.jpg": "Mate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 57\nStine: l57ol5 37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\ntase Nou « = « & E-o5-ooo368 (Cont inued)\nFronstin had <span class=\"highlight\">telephoned</span> her reference this case.
