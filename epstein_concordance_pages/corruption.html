Intervenor has witnessed the\nsame patern of political/ judicial <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> at work in his oun case; and has nou identified the same\nconspiracy at work in this case.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\ne intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2ol2/2ol3,\nintervenor filed a whistleblouer complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The\ncomplaint was escalated to Michael Horouitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A\nCase l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the\ncomplaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges\nthat Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered\nthat State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could\nlaunder $7o billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |\nintervenor’s atorneyz.\n\ne On l2/27/l9, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the\nFalse Claims Act, seeking $l billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,\nRepublicans, and his former atorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).\n\ne On5/l/l3, USDO! submited a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case\nl:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations\n“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”\n\ne oOn5/l3/l9, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ atorneys\nfor conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case l:l9-CR-oo49o-RMB hereby\natached by Declaration).\n\ne On5/l4/l9, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,\nafter fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case l:l9-CR-\noo49o-RMB hereby atached by Declaration).\n\nDAVID GOLDEN\nl5l5l NW MASON HILL RD\nNORTH PLAINS, OR 97l33\nMOTION TG INTERVENE - 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo634", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000661.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 23 of 86 23\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one\n\n2 video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC. She\n3 was told that the principal video that would have shoued the\n\n4 whole hall was corrupted. It was in DC with the FBI to see if\n5 they can reconstruct it.\n\n6 And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did,\n7 you knou, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in\n8 the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado knoun\n9 to the MCC before August lo, or was this <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> occurring\nlo on August lo, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the\nll servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was\nl2 suicide rather than some other cause.\n\nl3 So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a\nl4 question of trust or not trust. They ask you to detain people\nl5 and you trust the Bureau of Prisons. And it is within your\n\nl6 inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our\nl7 client.\n\nl8 We are angry about the conditions he was held in.

As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about undefined “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported connection between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in connection with defendant’s bail application, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB.

A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will require\na full-bloun re-litigation of the defamation action, which will result in a collateral mater taking\nover the trial.

And the cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements\ncount was severed only underscore this point. In both cases, the statement itself concerned an\nentirely different subject mater, provable through largely if not entirely different evidence. See\nUnited States v.

Mot. 5 at 8-9). The defendant is free to make at least some of these\narguments to the jury, but these assertions are not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five and Six.\nThis is merely an atempt to refashion the defendant’s claim that she gave truthful, immaterial\nanswers to ambiguous questions.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n5o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3234", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3.

Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span>, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6of6\nWhen the Topic of Epstein Came Back up with the Miami Herald Article\n\ne Arose when AK was in Securities.

Doubling doun on an increasingly\nfarfetched story, houever, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it\nmisrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.\n\nContrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor\nfrom the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit of the United States Atorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,\naffirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of\nher colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.\n\nHad the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would\nnever have obtained the 9o,ooo pages of material it nou possesses, material that is central—\nindeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention\ninjustice, to allou the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government\ncould not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.\n\n“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory pouer to make it\nclear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to oun up to it was\nmore serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4l4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 _ Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of 34\n“ongoing criminal investigation” into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate\ndocuments, invoking the “law enforcement privilege.” Ex.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought.

The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span>, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005496.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 69\nand \"good faith” of the New York investigation leading to the charges against her.

See Ex. G at SDNY _GM_o2742887-9l. In late November 2ol8, houever, Julie K. Broun\npublished a series of articles in the Miami Herald entitled “Perversion of Justice,” which were\nsharply critical of the NPA and the perceived leniency that Epstein received to resolve the\nFlorida Investigation. JJ confirmed that she read the Miami Herald articles when they\ncame out and “‘was very disturbed to read about hou the case was resolved in SDFL, which was\ninconsistent with [her] assumptions when the case was presented by the atorneys in February\n2ol6.” Jd. at SDNY_GM_o2742892.

See\nid. Shortly after that, the New York Investigation was opened.\n\nIt is also clear from the documents produced by the government, that the government\ninitially focused its investigation on Epstein and did not begin to investigate Ms. Maxwell until\nafter Epstein died on August lo, 2ol9, roughly one month after he was arrested. To give just\none example, the New York FBI did not speak to a single one of the four accusers in this case\nuntil after Epstein’s death.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

Those\nreasons are: (l) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability\nto prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and\n(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be\nprosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those\narguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the\nprosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to\nLefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been\nprovided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the\ndefense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion\nthis would seriously undermine the prosecution.\n\nThe defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the\ninvestigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,\nand to use political pressure to stop the investigation.\n\nI have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to\nmeet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case\nwill be disclosed.

Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the\nemail to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She\nalso told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going doun the same path that\nthe State Atorney’s Office had gone doun.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request\nag In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a\ndefendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel\nto discuss the merits of a case.\n\n%o The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and\nonce “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l232", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021323.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l49 3536o38, Pagel5l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l49 of 348\nthat come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established\nby the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other maters.\n\n(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably\nunvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has\nvindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain\ncircumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM 8§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span>, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

The OPR* (SAl-348) contains just such evidence of the negotiations\nbetween the Government and Epstein’s counsel which, in corroborating an intent on\nthe part of the parties to draft a co-conspirator clause that provided broader\nimmunity, accords with the plain meaning of the NPA. This is so, notwithstanding\nthat the OPR relies almost exclusively on the distant recollection of government\nemployees whose judgment and professionalism were being questioned with litle to\nno input from Epstein’s atorneys as to who or what they intended or understood the\nco-conspirator clause of the NPA to cover.

Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl3 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023171.jpg": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.jpg": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.jpg": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span>, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.jpg": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026035.jpg": "Page 234o\n€S UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT\nI MEMORANDUM\nMetropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York\nDATE: August l4, 2ol9\nTO: All Concerned\nFROM: Supervisory Atorney\nSUBJECT: Institutional Tour\nPlease be advised that a tour for representatives of the Department of Justice and the SDNY USAO will take place\non:\nThursday, August l5, 2ol9, at lo:oo a.m.\nThe follouing individual(s) may be present:\npom Principal Deputy Atorney General\nAdvisor at AG’s office\n— U.S. Atorney\npeer Deputy US Atorney\nChief of the Criminal Division, SDNY\npeek counset to the US Atorney\nPerr cher, Public <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span> Unit, SDNY\nChief, Public <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span> Unit, SDNY\nPlease inform me of their arrival so that I may greet them and take them on the tour.

She also told\nVillafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would\nnever serve a day in jail.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file\ncharges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” Ifa substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution.

USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°? Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl93 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustamnable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l6l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023171.tif": "CHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and restitution, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023178.tif": "3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects identified as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023179.tif": "to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal <span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span>, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l79", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.tif": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.””? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o9 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span>, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on <span class=\"highlight\">corruption</span> or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029030.tif": "_ ®\nPage l Y o9/3o/o8 l8:l6:3l\no9/3o/2oo8 KERR ERAEEEEE ARREST KKAAEERKEEEREAREE\nSENSITIVE / UNCLASSIFIED\n|\n| Case Number: 3lE-MM-lo8o62 Stat Agent Name: Report Date: o9/3o/2oo8 ee -l, 2\n| Serial No.: Stat Agent SOGC.: Accom Date.: o6/3o/2oo8 c-l,\nbvE -6\n7 Dees Accomplishment Involve Assisting Agents Soc Subject Name\nA Fugitive... 2... 2. eH J\nBankruptcy Fraud. ..... 2.28 |\nComputer Fraud/Abuse. . 2... 2 N | RA Squad Task Force\n<span class=\"highlight\">Corruption</span> of Public Officials: i Tere oma ers wena nme\nMoney Laundering. ...... 248 l PBC PB2 SSPBC\nSub.
