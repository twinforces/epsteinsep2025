Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of <span class=\"highlight\">Indonesia</span>, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4) (affirming district court order\nof pretrial release of defendant, a resident and citizen of Denmark-from where defendant\ncould not be extradited-charged with bulk cash smuggling and forfeiture, noting that the\n\n” This Court’s opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should\nnot be provided an unfair advantage. It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000286.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l3 of l6\n\n“bail statute does not . . . require that foreign defendants be detained simply because their\n\nreturn cannot be guaranteed through extradition”);\n\ne United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29 (D.D.C. 2oo4) (ordering release of\ndefendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the l8 years preceding\nhis arrest when he landed in Colorado for a family ski trip based on allegations he\nviolated the Export Administration Act and the International Economic Emergency\nPouers Act by acquiring products capable of triggering nuclear weapons and exported\nthem to Pakistan, despite defendant’s lack of any ties to the United States, despite finding\nthat defendant had “no ties to the United States or the Washington, D.C. area,” despite\nfinding that “no evidence [was] presented establishing that Defendant has ever lived in\nthis country, ouned property here, or that he has any family or community ties in the\nUnited States,” despite finding that defendant “was only in this country in order to\nparticipate in a ski vacation with his wife and daughter,” and despite finding that “the\nweight of the evidence against Defendant is substantial”);\n\ne United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 2oo9) (ordering release of\ndefendant, a naturalized citizen of the United States, despite finding defendant “thas\nstrong ties to [her home country of] China,” finding that the defendant ouned property in\nChina, that the defendant spent almost all of her ten years of marriage living abroad with\nher husband, that during 2oo8 the defendant spent only 22 days in the United States, that\nthe charges against the defendant (violations of International Emergency Economic\nPouers Act and the Export Administration Regulations) “were serious and carried a\npotential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong\nevidence against” the defendant “including her oun statement to investigators that she\nsmuggled the UAV autopilot components out of the United States and knew there were\nlicensing requirements for such items”).\n\nThe fact that the government will potentially seek a significant sentence if Mr. Epstein is\nconvicted on all counts similarly does not preclude pretrial release in this case — several courts\nhave ordered pretrial release despite finding that the defendant faced serious charges carrying\nsignificant potential sentences. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (reversing district court order of\ndetention despite finding that defendants, natives of <span class=\"highlight\">Indonesia</span>, faced “lengthy term of\nincarceration” and “strong” evidence of guilt existed); Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d l29 (ordering\nrelease of defendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the l8 years\npreceding his arrest, despite finding that “the weight of the evidence against Defendant is\nsubstantial”); Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (noting that charges “were serious and carried a\npotential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong evidence\nagainst” the defendant “including her oun statement to investigators that she smuggled the UAV\nautopilot components out of the United States and knew there were licensing requirements for\nsuch items”).
