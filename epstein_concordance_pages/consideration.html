Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

It should especially weigh on the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater.

In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

Background\nThis ruling follous the Court’s bail hearing held on July l5, 2ol9. The issue before the\nCourt is whether the Defendant should continue to be remanded (incarcerated) pending trial or\n| whether he should be granted release while the case proceeds. No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See Transcript, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000480.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 9 of 33 .\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v.

For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base detention decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F.

The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v.

No mater the answer to this\nquestion and no mater what has been said in Court in analyzing the mater, this is a criminal\ncase and the Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, is innocent of the Federal charges alleged against him\nnou and until such time, if it comes, that a jury or the Court finds (after fair and thorough\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the facts and the law) that he is guilty. See Transcript, dated July 8, 2ol9\n(“7/8/l9 Tr.’’), at 2-3; Transcript, dated July l5, 2ol9 (7/l5/l9 Tr.”), at 4o. It should also be :\nborne in mind that the Court has not (yet) been presented with a motion to dismiss the\nIndictment.\nThis is a federal as opposed to a state case. We proceed under federal law and federal\nrules. The key federal statute that applies here is l8 U.S.C. § l59l which sets forth the crime of\nsex trafficking with which Mr. Epstein is charged. Mr. Epstein is also charged with conspiring\nwith others to commit sex trafficking under l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\nWith respect to the issue of remand versus release, l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 applies. It sets forth\na presumption in favor of remand, an exception to the presumption in most cases which favors\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000792.jpg": "Cas@-4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OY lsuisageaye FoF 33 |\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. :\nSupp. 3d 6oo, 6lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (quoting United States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. |\nl987). |\n\n“The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the |\npresentation and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of information at the [release/remand] hearing.” l8 U.S.C. § :\n\n3l42(f)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base detention decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nE. The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool).

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

In\naccordance with this Court's December 7, 2o2o Order, see Dkt. No. 89, she filed these\nmaterials under seal and proposed narrouly tailored redactions on those materials. The\nGovernment did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. The\nCourt will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions after applying the three—part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d\nllo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of the common\nlaw presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing factors include\nbut are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo II\"), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995)). The proposed\nredactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant's submissions are\n\"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,”\nthereby qualifying as a \"judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995).\nAnd the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access ataches. Id. at\nl46; see also Nixon v. Warner Comme'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 6o2 (l978). As with the\nredactions to her renewed motion for bail, the proposed redactions here are narrouly\ntailored to serve substantial interests, including, most importantly, third parties\npersonal privacy interests. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 46o, 467\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol7). See also Dkt. No. 95.

In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000865.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2-ooSB Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNH6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000870.jpg": "CaseGa26-2l-oo38 Adin dd Gumein4lB92 FiRNb6S/22/Phag Page of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000890.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagel4 of 25\n\nll/o6/2o2o LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions.

(Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001164.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck A Ob 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in detaining defendants\npending trial.

Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001207.jpg": "CaSesk 2o-ef o33os Ade niDGchneHo lo32l , lB i2o F72geRage HOF 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell’ require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the\ngovernment does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that\nshe suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 3o6, 3l4-l5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Even according to the indictment, Ms.\nMaxwell’s alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in l997.

This Court should follou\nother courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebuted the\npresumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged\noffenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2o2o WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,\nNo. 3:2o-CR-l8-J-32JBT, 2o2o WL lo42o5l, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2o2o); Conway,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *4-5.\n\nThe Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government... .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day\nof access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including\nthose with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2o2l—as of earlier this week, and given\nthe volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity\nto access to her discovery from 7:oo a.m. to 8:oo p.m. every day of the week.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

The final judgment rule\nis therefore “at its strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458\nUS. 263, 265 (l982). In criminal cases, “finality generally is defined by a judgment of conviction and\nthe imposition of a sentence.” Florida v. Thomas, 532 U.S. 774, 777 (2ool) (internal quotation marks\nomited).\n\nThere is a “narrou” exception to the final judgment rule that permits appeals from\n“decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, in the interest of achieving a healthy legal\nsystem, nonetheless be treated as final.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc, 5ll U.S. 863, 867—\n68 (l994) (internal quotation marks and citations omited). The Supreme Court has described the\n“conditions for collateral order appeal as seringenf’ in general, Digital Equip.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a leter request\nseeking an in camera conference for the presentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and\na request to seal the November 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for\nthe sealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no longer\nfully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and instead proposing\nredactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters. The Government has\nindicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant’s proposed redactions, which\nare consented to by the Government. The Court’s decision is guided by the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (ill) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” Jd.\nat l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (“Amodeo I?’)).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool847\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 8l Filed l2/o3/2o Page 2 of 2\n\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant’s leter\nmotions are “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the\nLugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And\nwhile the Court assumes that the common law presumption of access ataches, in balancing\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments\nthe Defendant has put forth—including, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals\nreferenced in the leters—favor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby\nORDERED to docket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o.\n\nFor the reasons outlined in the Government’s leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o,\nthe Court DENIES the Defendant’s request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the\nprivacy interests referenced in the Defendant’s November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored redactions.\n\nThe parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a briefing\nschedule for the Defendant’s forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail.\n\nSO ORDERED.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of recreation\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive recreation time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits. While the leter accurately states that one video teleconference (VTC) was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001942.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 65 of 9l 65\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl litigation before your Honor about what is in the NPA, and the\n2 government, we expect, is going to take the position that\n\n3 unlike 'o7 is covered and nothing else.

Circumstances of her arrest, as discussed, may\n\nl6 cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the\nl7 government, a claim that she makes throughout the papers and\n\nl8 here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nl9 face such serious charges herself may not have set in until\n2o after she was actually indicted.\n2l Moreover, Ms. Maxwell's argument rests on a\n22 speculative premise that prior to indictment Ms. Maxwell had as\n23 clear an understanding as she does nou of the serious nature of\n24 the charges, the potential sentence she may face, and the\n25 strength of the government's case.

Bail in extradition cases\n\n2o. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person\nhas the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption\nthat bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act l976 applies”’. The\nthree exceptions in Schedule l that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are\nsubstantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to\ncustody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the\ncourse of justice®®.\n\n2l. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as\nmany of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature\nand seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and\ncommunity ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of\ntheir obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence\nagainst the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental\ninjury to another person.\n\n22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the\nway in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.\n\n“ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. l28(4).\n\n*’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s.95(2). The principle of specialty is a rule of extradition law that is intended to ensure that an\n\nextradited person is not dealt with in the requesting state for any offence other than that for which they have been\n\nextradited.\n\n“© Extradition Act 2oo3, ss. loo(2), lo3(2) and lo8(2).\n\n“’ Bail Act l976, s. 4(2A).

As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US\ncriminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition\nproceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to\nbe considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is\nmade, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition\nrequest, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against\nthe grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.\n\nD. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to\n\nthe US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2o2o\n24.

Similarly, there is a high threshold in relation to injustice’,\nand it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that\nJustice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish\nthe contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural\nsafeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the\nfact that Ms Maxwell had, in the hypothetical scenario under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, absconded from ongoing\nproceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court\nexpressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition\nrequires <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the circumstances which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing\njustice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those circumstances it is very unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.\n\nForum\n\n32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where\nextradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested\nperson’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified maters’””\nrelating to the interests of justice (and only those maters), the extradition should not take place”.\n\n33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in\nLondon”, three of the ‘specified maters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition\nwould be barred by forum. First, it appears that the majority of the harm caused by the offending”\nalleged in the superseding indictment occurred in the United States. An extradition judge would treat\n\n°° Kakis at 784.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 22 of 36\nto authorities in the United States would not be binding in the United Kingdom, and the defendant\ncould easily decide not to consent to extradition once found abroad.\n\nFurther, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on extradition\nbased on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the passage of\ntime, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have recognized that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F.

Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lol Filed l2/23/2o Page l of 2\nUSDC SDNY .\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/23/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl.

See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national.

The Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are\n“Judicial documents;” (ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the\nmaterials; and (ill) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at\nll9-2o. “Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002470.jpg": "LOAas6 W2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36-9 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 4 of 33 a\n\nl materials; (2) identify and evaluate the weight of any\n\n2 countervailing interests; and (3) determine whether the\n\n5 countervailing interests rebut the presumption.\n\n4 The presumption of public access ataches to judicial\n5 documents; that is, those documents filed in accordance with a\n6 decided motion or papers that are relevant to the Court's\n\n7 exercise of its inherent supervisory pouers.

Accordingly, the presumption of public\n\nl5 access is somewhat less weighty than for a dispositive motion.\nl6 It is, nevertheless, important to the public's interest in\n\nl7 monitoring federal courts' exercise of their Article III pouers\nl8 that the public review the documents.\n\nl9 With this presumption of public access in mind, the\n2o Court turns to the countervailing interests at stake.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 38\nEpstein’s equal—if not his superior—and baselessly caricatured as a villain of near-mythical\nproportions. Only at this time did the government, according to its oun account, decide to\nlaunch an investigation of Ms. Maxwell and prosecute her on allegations that it had previously,\nrepeatedly (and properly, since any charges would have been baseless) determined did not merit\ncharges. In short, the government’s response to the media frenzy was not to adhere to its earlier\nobjective analysis and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the facts, but to feed the frenzy and substitute Ms.\nMaxwell for Epstein.\n\nThus, the government announced its arrest and indictment of Ms. Maxwell on July 2,\n2o2o, the exact anniversary of Epstein’s indictment. At an extraordinary press conference, the\nUnited States Atorney for this District described Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution as the “prequel” to\nthe Epstein indictment; thereafter, the then-Atorney General, in rare public comments on bail\nproceedings in an individual case, expressed his delight that “we were able to get Miss\nMaxwell.”\n\nBut in trying “to get” Ms. Maxwell, the government compromised its standards, cut\ncorners, and exceeded its authority under the law. This is shoun in the present motion and\nothers we are filing today, and includes the follouing:\n\n* The government has pressed forward with this case even though the NPA expressly\nprovides that “the United States .. . will not institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Rather than argue, as it has time and again, that\nsuch agreements should be construed as drafted, the government does the opposite\nhere, retreating from the very agreement that its oun agents negotiated and agreed to\nwith the approval of senior levels of Main Justice.\n\n* The government has concocted a federal Mann Act case against Ms. Maxwell by\nalleging that, on some unspecified occasion during a four-year period between l994\nand l997, and in an unspecified manner, she somehou transported and caused a\nsingle individual to travel across state lines for purposes of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity with Epstein. Those charges, in turn, require the government to allege\na violation of New York law relating to sexual activity. Here, the government has\nrelied upon an alleged class B misdemeanor that, if the state statute of limitations had\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo258o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 38\nthe NPA’s language and structure, as well as the manner in which it was negotiated, were highly\natypical. The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and\nbore litle resemblance to, a standard agreement.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein\ncase, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh. B (Dep’t of Justice, Office of\nProfessional Responsibility, Executive Summary of Report, Investigation into the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of its 2oo6-2oo8 Federal\nCriminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the\nInvestigation, November 2o2o) at x. In particular, the OPR concluded that Acosta “agreed to\nseveral unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the\ncircumstances.” Jd. While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms\nto which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.\n\nA. The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”). Thus, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 38\nId. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.\n\nIn the paragraph follouing the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that\n“Epstein understands that the United States Atorney has no authority to require the State\nAtorney’s Office to abide by” the NPA. NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding compliance by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be prosecuted\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\nresolution that would, among other things, provide maximum protection for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 25\nretroactivity provision. PROTECT Act, S. l5l, lo8th Cong. (as engrossed in the Senate, Feb.\n24. 2oo3). When the House and Senate conferenced to resolve differences between the bills, the\nretroactivity provision was omited. As Senator Leahy, one of the bill’s original co-sponsors and\na former chair of the Senate Judiciary Commitee, stated on the Senate floor, the omission was\nintentional: “I am pleased that the conference agreed to drop language from the original House-\npassed bill that would have extended the limitations period retroactively.” Senator Leahy,\nAmber Legislation, Cong. Rec. l49:5o, $5l47 (2oo3).\n\nSuch a clear expression of congressional intent should end the Landgraf analysis at the\nfirst step. In applying Landgraf, the Supreme Court has made clear that the “expressly\nprescribed” analysis is not limited to the text of the statute, but may look to legislative history.\nSee Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 355-57 (l999) (examining “structure and legislative history”\nas part of first Landgraf step); see also Latab v. Ashcroft, 384 F. 3d 8, l4 (lst Cir. 2oo4) (‘our\ninquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of\nstatutory construction, such as the statute’s structure and legislative history”). Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a legislative history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the legislative history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd. That is not the case here.\n\nAs Judge Katzmann of the Second Circuit has recognized, unambiguous legislative\nhistory should not be disregarded:\n\nWhen courts construe statutes in ways that respect what legislators consider their\n\nwork product, the judiciary not only is more likely to reach the correct result, but\n\nalso promotes comity with the first branch of government. It is a bipartisan\n\ninstitutional perspective within Congress that courts should consider reliable\n\nlegislative history and that failing to do so impugns Congress’s workways.\n\nRobert A.

See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, houever, is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n\nAta minimum, Toussie “potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach” in\ncriminal cases. United States v. Miller, 9ll F.3d 638, 645 (lst Cir. 2ol8) (evaluating 2oo3\nAmendment in adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claim). “In other words, when\nCongress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from applying an enlarged\ncriminal statute of limitations retrospectively.” Jd. As shoun in the first step of Landgraf, the\ntrumpet sounded by Congress in enacting the 2oo3 Amendment was anything but uncertain:\ncongressional intent is clear.\n\nIn the criminal context, the retroactive application of an extended statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim is not merely an impermissible effect under Landgraf; it violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3).* As Landgraf itself\nrecognized, houever, the principle against retroactivity is not simply an application of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary\nconsiderations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 265-66. See also Thom v.\nAshcroft, 369 F.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., writing for the majority but noting\nhe was speaking for himself) (stating that anti-retroactivity presumption in Landgraf is “triggered\n+ For this reason, the government would be barred from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for any offense against the third\naccuser (identified in the indictment as Minor Victim-3) even if the 2oo3 Amendment otherwise applied, because\nthe third accuser reached age 25 in a. and thus the statute of limitations as to her had expired by the time\nof the 2oo3 Amendment.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2664\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v. Rivera-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 28l (2d Cir. l995). That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 3 of 9\nPage 3\ndefendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court.

The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to\ncertain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional\nredactions. Having considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\nredaction requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 2 of l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002773.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 7 of l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002779.jpg": "wwe.

Mot. l at 2o-2l. Aside from the reference to “United States” which, as noted\nabove, is insufficient, the defendant does not point to any language in this provision that\npurportedly binds other districts. Instead, she argues that the absence of language specifically\nlimiting this provision to the USAO-SDFL demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal\ngovernment. This argument fails, for at least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts\nthe holding of Annabi: in this Circuit, the presumption is that plea agreements bind only the district\nin which they are entered, absent affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence\nof express limiting language in this provision is not an affirmative indication of a broader\napplication. Accordingly, under Second Circuit law, the absence of limiting language in this\nspecific provision provides no support for the defendant’s motion.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s argument acknouledges that the plain terms of the NPA\nimmunized Epstein from prosecution in “this District,” that is, the Southern District of Florida.\nSee NPA at 2 (“After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2968\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 239\n“a direct and primary object of the contracting parties was to confer a benefit on the third party.”\nFla.

With respect to Maxwell in particular, OPR interviewed Maria Villafafia, the\nlead prosecutor on the case, and noted:\nVillafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s\nlongtime relationship with a close female friend who was a well-\nknoun socialite, but, according to Villafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t\nhave any specific evidence against her.” Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would\nbenefit from the provision were the four female assistants identified\nby name.\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo298l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 239\nFacto Clause and Landgraf’s second step.”). Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003025.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9l of 239\n\nEx. 7), but AUSA-l does not recall the details of that conversation (see Ex. 4 at 4), nor is the\nGovernment aware of any notes or other records documenting the substance of the call.

The April and July 2ol6 Depositions of Maxwell\n\nOn March 2, 2ol6, Maxwell moved for entry of a protective order for materials produced\nin discovery and submited a proposed order for the <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the Honorable Robert W.\nSweet, the United States District Judge who was then overseeing the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil\nlitigation. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. Nos. 38 & 39-l). On or about March 4, 2ol6, Boies\nSchiller represented that Giuffre did not oppose the entry of a protective order, but opposed the\nform proposed by Maxwell out of concern that it was overly broad and could lead to over-\ndesignation of material as confidential. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 4o at 2). Boies Schiller\nsubmited a redline of Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and adding\nlanguage that confidential material could be disclosed to law enforcement. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. B).\nOn March l8, 2ol6, Judge Sweet entered a protective order governing the discovery and\ndissemination of confidential information after the parties agreed to the form of the order originally\nproposed by Maxwell.

In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v.

Kentucky, 448\nU.S. 98, lo4 (l98o).\n\nUnder the third party doctrine, the Fourth Amendment “does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by [the third party] to Government authorities.”\nUnited States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (l976). The Supreme Court has long held that “a person\nhas no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,”\nSmith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (l979), “even if the information is revealed on the\nassumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose,” Miller, 425 U.S. 435, at 443.\nExceptions to the applicability of the third party doctrine are narrou. For example, in Carpenter,\nl38 S. Ct. at 222o, the Supreme Court declined to extend the third party doctrine to cell site\nlocation information, holding that “a warrant is required in the rare case where the suspect has a\nlegitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party.” l38 S.

Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 348\nIl. .OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA wee eeeeeeee l34\nA.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 348\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3252\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!7” In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!”8\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003322.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.!8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3322\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003324.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°” The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl.

The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5.

The expense of trial and appeal;\nll. The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other\npending cases; and\nl2. The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution.\n4. USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 348\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So. 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”’).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?* Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span>\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!”_ The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!°\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natomeys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have jotned with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR- oooo338l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . | was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVU. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo34o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more.

While the\ngovernment atempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an “offense”\nor “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails\nthat conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which “offense involving”\nlanguage has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as\npermiting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority\nto the contrary. <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span> of such authority compels application of § 3283 by reference to\nthe elements of the offense at issue, and even under the definition of “sexual abuse” the\ngovernment proposes, none of the elements of either § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) constitutes sexual\nabuse.\n\nl, The 2oo3 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively.\n\nThe government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework for\ndetermining whether a statute applies retroactively. Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is\n“to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute’s proper reach”; if it has,\nthere is no need to proceed further. 55l U.S. at 28o. Ifit has not, the court must determine\n“whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a\nparty possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties\nwith respect to transactions already completed.” Jd.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3659\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page9of22\n\nthat Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’\nCongress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision\naltogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknouledged in Landgraf,\nan amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:\n\"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nintentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.\n* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight\nto be given congressional <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),\nrelying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights\nAct of l99l of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a\nprior Congress. See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 22\n\nIt will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that\n\nretroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.\n\nThat <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, houever, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against\n\nretroactivity.

Thus, it is not anomalous at all that Congress\nwould “exempt[] all past offenders” from the new limitations period, as the government asserts\n(Opp. 3l); to the contrary, the law presumes that past conduct is exempt from legislation. Here,\nCongress’ clear intent that the 2oo3 Amendment not be retroactive resolves the Landgraf inquiry\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor at step one.\nDe Cases applying the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively are readily\ndistinguishable.\n\nWhile the government cites several cases that have applied the 2oo3 Amendment\nretroactively (Opp. 26-27), most of those cases analyzed the issue under the Ex Post Facto\nClause and gave litle, if any, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to congressional intent regarding retroactivity (as\nopposed to the intent of the amendment itself).

It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the\nprimary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v. Cornielle,\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo369o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 34\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the\nMann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party’s atorney\npresents serious risks to the fairness ofa trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d. Disqualification of counsel also implicates\nMaxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWF), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the atorneys who\nrepresented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with\nthe facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o—7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 (2d\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003729.jpg": "CascGASS- dee O933o-PAK umbocuMeNt 2OBsd on FilethO4¥Le2 44 /oPageS Ahdde 4 of lo\n\nIn their Rule 2l Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omited\nfrom this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to\njoin this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition\nunder Rule 2o (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). As courts generally use the standards of Rule\nl5 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the\nRule l5 Motion.’ The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 2l Motion as if\nthey are set forth in the Rule l5 Motion as well.

As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties,\nthe Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 2l Motion related to her\ncircumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr.\nDershouitz’s motion to intervene (DE 29l-l), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, ll, l3,\nl5, l9 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties.

As the Court has taken it upon itself\nto strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 2l Motion and related filings, the Court\nconcludes that Mr. Derschouitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his\nmotion to intervene will be denied as moot.’ Regarding whether a shou cause order should\n\n* This also moots Mr. Dershouitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in\nSupport of Motion for Limited Intervention.

It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d l285 (2d\nCir. l99l); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 2l9 F.3d l75, l82—84 (2d Cir.2ooo); Granite\nPartners, L.P. v.

Olson v.\nAndrus, 58l F.2d l77, l82 (8th Cir. l978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the government in\nthis action is “intolerable as a mater of policy”).\n\nIt would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to continue to litigate this issue\npiecemeal. Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003800.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- Qi BF AAR NVaD GUM ALASD , HHRedeie/ BEI29 | PA AadERE of 8\nApp.-ol36\n\nIn deciding to stay the civil case, courts generally weigh six factors: (l) the extent to\nwhich the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the\ncriminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the\ndelay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; (5) the interest of the Court; and\n(6) the public interest. See Trustees of the Plumbers and Pipefiters Nat’l Pension Fund v.\nTransworld Mech., Inc., 886 F.

First, presumably the issues in any purported criminal\ninvestigation are identical with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in\n“trafficking” the Plaintiff as she claims from l999 to 2ool. As to the second factor Plaintiff\nclaims to have information about this issue, although no indictment has been issued. Third,\ngiven the age of the underlying allegations, almost 2o years, there does not appear to be any\nprejudice that could be caused by any delay. Fourth, in the event there actually is an\ninvestigation and Plaintiff is involved in fomenting the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a\nsignificant interest in knouing about the investigation so that she can appropriately respond and\nassess any claim of privilege. Concerning factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the\nproceedings before it and also has an interest in protecting the rights of the litigants. Appropriate\ndisclosure would allou an informed decision to be made regarding these issues. Finally, there is\nno compelling public interest that would outweigh disclosure and an informed decision.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo38oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003846.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l6 Filed o4/l9/2l Page2of2\n\nIf the Government does not intend to use any of the documents subject to the pending\nmotions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts, the Court will defer <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of\nthose motions until it has scheduled the trial of the perjury counts.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: April l9, 2o2l AN ig\n\nNew York, New York\n\nALISON J.

But a non-prosecution\nagreement is not an ordinary contract. Federal prosecutors knou hou to draft clear limitations\non promises made to criminal defendants, and they have a unique obligation to do so. What\nstrains “common sense” is the notion that any reasonable prosecutor who intended the NPA to be\nread as the government contends would have omited the limitations and modifications the\ngovernment nou seeks—particularly when dealing with a defendant who sought to “resolve\nglobally” his criminal liability.

While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that the NPA unambiguously bars her prosecution here, and that neither\ndiscovery nor a hearing is necessary for the Court to grant this motion, the government’s\narguments regarding the NPA parties’ intent simply cannot be credited without the <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof evidence. Because Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty, has no personal knouledge regarding the\nparties’ intent and no access to relevant documents, she should be permited to take discovery in\nadvance of any hearing.\n\nl.

While the government ludicrously faults Ms.\nMaxwell for failing to produce “documentary evidence” of the parties’ intent and the scope of\nthe SDFL investigation (Opp. lo), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such\nevidence without discovery.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation.

These additions will require the defense to (l)\nreview a substantial amount of discovery that is nou potentially relevant as a result of the S2\nIndictment; (2) re-review discovery that it had previously considered in light of the changes to\nthe case against her; (3) conduct new investigations based on the new charges, including\npotential interviews of new witnesses; and (4) re-evaluate her trial preparation and strategy.\nSecond, although jury trials have resumed in the district and conditions in MDC and around the\ncountry are improving, the defendant’s and defense counsel’s preparation efforts to date have\nbeen and to some extent continue to be hampered by the effects of the COVID-l9 pandemic.

Third, defense counsel must\nbalance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental pre-trial motions in\nresponse to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were\nrecently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens\nplaced on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the\nS2 indictment.\n\nThe Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any\nadjournment be no longer than necessary. For one, the Defendant, whose counsel strenuously\nrequest the adjournment, is detained pre-trial.

The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v.

By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63. But there is nothing unlawful about “entic[ing]” an adult to “travel and be transported for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual acts” if those acts themselves are entirely lawful. Nor does\nMs. Maxwell’s alleged role in Accuser-3’s purported lawful sexual activity with Epstein in\nEngland, while Accuser-3 was allegedly under age l8, evince an intent to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel before she turned l8.\n\n* In addressing the sufficiency of allegations in the similar context of a motion to dismiss, courts have recognized\nthat they are limited to <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the language of the indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Sharpe, 438 F.3d\nl257, l263 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (“a district court is limited to reviewing the face of the indictment’) (emphasis in\noriginal); United States v. Hit, 249 F.3d lolo, lol6 (D.C.

(/d. J\nl-9, ll-l3, l6-l9). For the same reasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss\nCount Five and either Count One or Count Three as multiplicitous.\n\nVv. The Court Should Dismiss the S2 Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should also dismiss the S2 indictment due to the government’s excessive and\nprejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution against Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due\nprocess rights. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss the\nSl Indictment due to the excessive pre-indictment delay in charging her with those offenses.\n(Dkt. l38, 2o9). The S2 Indictment only compounds these issues by charging additional\noffenses based on alleged conduct that the government has knoun about since in or about 2oo7,\nwhich it added for tactical reasons to shore up its case against Ms. Maxwell. For the same\nreasons discussed in her prior motion, the Court should dismiss the $2 Indictment. The Court\ndenied Ms. Maxwell’s initial motion on these grounds, but preserved Ms. Maxwell’s ability to\nrenew her motion after trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8). Accordingly, we request that the Court defer\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of this motion until trial.\n\nVI. The Court Should Order a Bill of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six.\n\nThe Court should also order the government to file a Bill of Particulars pursuant to Rule\n7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because Counts Five and Six of the $2\nIndictment do not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Rule 7(f)\npermits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with sufficient particularity\nthe nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to\nprevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second\ntime for the same offense.” United States v.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 349\nIl. .OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA uo. eeeeeeeeee l34\nA.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 77 of 349\n\nSloman also told OPR that he did not knou hou the decision to offer a two-year plea offer\nwas reached, but he believed that Acosta made the decision based on recommendations from\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. *”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “‘nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we . . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”*? Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould .. . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\na In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\nae Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\n83 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\n84 OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4o of 349\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”!’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriffs Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nal Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l47 of 349\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\n\nI. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA. The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.8° The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. /d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\nl89 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004446.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l49 of 349\n\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\n\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\n\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\n\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\n\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\n\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\n\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\n\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> should be given to referring the case to those\n\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\n\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

USAM § 9-27.42o specifies:\n\nIn determining whether it would be appropriate to enter into a plea\nagreement, the atorney for the government should weigh all\nrelevant considerations, including:\nl. The defendant’s willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of others;\nZs The defendant’s history with respect to criminal\nactivity;\n3. The nature and seriousness of the offense or offenses\ncharged;\n4. The defendant’s remorse or contrition and his/her\nwillingness to assume responsibility for his/her conduct;\n5. The desirability of prompt and certain disposition of\nthe case;\n6. The likelihood of obtaining a conviction at trial;\nre The probable effect on witnesses;\n8. The probable sentence or other consequences if the\ndefendant is convicted;\n9, The public interest in having the case tried rather\nthan disposed of by a guilty plea;\nlo. The expense of trial and appeal;\nll. The need to avoid delay in the disposition of other\npending cases; and\nl2. The effect upon the victim’s right to restitution.\n4. USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004450.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l53 of 349\nprosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of l984, the\nSentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing\npractices.” !?>\n\nThe Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge\nand pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of\nthe case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or designated\nsupervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nl95 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo445o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004453.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l56 of 349\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 76o F.2d l244, l248 (llth Cir. l985) (in order to satisfy “heavy\nburden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging\nvoluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against\nthe defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe\nthe defendant’s wife had commited a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.\nState, 839 So, 2d 9o6, 9o9 (Fla. App. 2oo3) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a\nthird party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge\nthe third party.”).\n\nThe second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’\npromises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.\nl997), as <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in\nopen court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,\nwho had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and atempted\nto prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state\nappealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD. State Bar Rules\n\nDuring the period relevant to this Report, the five subject atorneys were members of the\nbar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in\nwhich they held membership.!”’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of\nthe U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law\nprovisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule ll.l(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,\npractice, peer review, and discipline of atorneys (Atorney Admission Rules).'?° Atorney\nAdmission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Atorney or AUSA employed full-time by the\ngovernment may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United\nStates in the atorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any atorney so appearing\nml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.\nl98 These rules have been in effect since December l994.\n\nl29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4453\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l62 of 349\nunambiguous standard or engaged in professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or\nentering into the NPA, including its addendum.\n\nA. U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span>\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l93 of 349\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”°”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o6 of 349\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues. Every case is different\nand must be judged on its oun facts. In this case, houever, given the unorthodox nature of the\nstate-based resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision to pursue it set the case on a wholly different\ntrack than what had been originally contemplated by his experienced staff, the nature and scope of\nEpstein’s criminal conduct, the circumstances surrounding the removal of the computers from\nEpstein’s residence, and the potential for obtaining evidence revealing serious additional criminal\nconduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure that he was fully informed about the consequences\nof pursing the course of action that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flouing\nfrom the express terms of the NPA. In deciding to resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta lost sight\nof the bigger picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be\npursued. The decision to forgo the government’s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and to\npursue significant investigative steps should have been made only after careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of\nall the costs and benefits of the proposed action. OPR did not find evidence that Acosta fully\nconsidered the costs of ending the investigation prematurely.”\n\nC. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him. . . . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\n28s In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his “‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o9 of 349\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 233 of 349\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of .. .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l6 of 349\n6.

Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is identical\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at l3-l4). Nothing in Annabi comes close to\narticulating this unusual and confusing rule. Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\napplication of the affirmative appearance rule. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x\n92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (summary order) (“In the absence of any language in the New Jersey plea\nagreement to suggest otherwise, and with no compelling reason to infer any intent to the contrary,\nwe decline to extend the New Jersey plea agreement beyond its clearly stated terms.” (citation\nomited)); United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Thus, we conclude\n' The defense motion uses the phrase “exact same” when asserting that this rule exists, but it is\nunclear what precisely that means because it is not a legal term of art, and there are of course\ncomplicated considerations when examining the similarity or differences between charges, as\nDouble Jeopardy Clause jurisprudence illustrates. The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 26\n\ntime the defendant was indicted in July 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was indicted in 2ol9.\nSpecifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in or about 2oo7 in\nconnection with a prior investigation conducted by the USAO-SDFL, Minor Victim-4 did not\nagree to be interviewed by the prosecution team handling this case until July 2o2o. The\nGovernment then conducted two preliminary interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video\nteleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the difficult nature of the interview topics,\nhouever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel\nconstraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Government was unable\nto travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2o2l, at which time the Government\nconducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took\nadditional investigative steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2o2l, approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact.

Along with his top deputy prosecutor and experienced detectives,\nDistrict Atorney Castor thoroughly investigated Constand’s claim. In evaluating the\nlikelinood of a successful prosecution of Cosby, the district atorney foresaw difficulties\nwith Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a\ncomplaint promptly. D.A. Castor further determined that a prosecution would be\nfrustrated because there was no corroborating forensic evidence and because testimony\nfrom other potential claimants against Cosby likely was inadmissible under governing\nlaws of evidence. The collective weight of these considerations led D.A. Castor to\nconclude that, unless Cosby confessed, “there was insufficient credible and admissible\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto prosecute a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\ndiscretion to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” discretion and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of constitutional due\nprocess and as compelled by the principle of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443. The prosecutor stated the terms of the\nagreement on the record, and the trial court accepted the terms of Zuber’s guilty plea and\nol In Santobello, the Supreme Court of the United States did not state explicitly that\nit was premising its holding on due process guarantees. Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater. See Santobello, 4o4\nU.S., at 266-67 (Douglas, J. concurring).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4866\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 58 of 8o\nrather than on contract law principles. Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 6l4\nF.2d 36o (3d Cir. l98o), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,\npreliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the\nprosecutor atempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 36l-62. The defendant\nrejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated\nagreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the\ncourt, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.\nId. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the\nprosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his\nright to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, houever, that, by contrast, when a\n“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this\ninduced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24\n\nConsidered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their\nword, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full\nunderstanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of\none or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or\ndecisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness\nconsiderations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,\nbased upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are\nbound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon\nthose guarantees.\n\n22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental\nreliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 6l4 F.2d\nat 365.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances.

(Dkt. No. 38 at l.) Maxwell submited a proposed\nform of order for Judge Sweet’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. (Dkt. No. 39-l.) |\nGiuffre represented that she “[did] not oppose the entrance [sic] of a Protective Order in |\nthis case, but [did] oppose a Protective Order in the form proposed by Defendant because it is |\noverly broad and can lead to abuse and over designation[.]” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4o at 2.) |\nGiuffre redlined Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and (insofar as |\nis relevant) adding language to paragraph 4— stating that confidential information “shall not be :\ndisclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case”’—to provide that |\nconfidential materials also could be disclosed with impunity “in any related mater, including but :\nnot limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 4l-5 § 4.) Maxwell |\nopposed these modifications. (l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 49.) |\nAt a hearing held on March l7, 2ol6, Judge Sweet concluded that “of course” a\nprotective order was warranted. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66, at 4:25—5:l.) He gave no |\nreason, but as Maxwell made her motion on the basis of privacy concerns, and Giuffre consented |\nto entry of some form of a protective order for the same reason, I assume that Judge Sweet found !\nprivacy concerns to constitute good cause—which, given the subject mater of the lawsuit, would |\ncertainly have been warranted.\nJudge Sweet did not, houever, resolve any of the disputes between the parties about what |\nshould or should not be in the order. Instead, he directed the parties to come up with an |\nagreement to which everyone could stipulate. (/d. at 5:l—-l2.) By the end of the hearing, Giuffre, |\nwho was eager to take Maxwell’s deposition, agreed to the form of order originally proposed by |\nMaxwell. (Id. 9:7-24.)

A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” Black’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 5o of 69\nno authority indicating that more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “motivated by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand reliability of the government’s investigation.

Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005657.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page5of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 4\nInternational Society for the Study and Treatment of Trauma and Dissociation\n(ISSTD)\n2oo4 Continuing Education in Forensic Psychology (2l hours)\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP)\nAdvanced Topics in Criminal Forensic Assessment\nForensic Consultation, Expertise & Testimony\nForensic Mental Health Assessment: Principles and Cases\n2ool Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, Levels I & II (34 hours)\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing International Association\n(EMDRIA)\n\nl999 - 2ooo Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Intensive Training, Parts I & II (72 hours)\nBehavioral Technology Transfer Group\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nBailey, T.D. & Rocchio, L.M.

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span> needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005929.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

The defense expert\nnotice includes four other sets of opinions that supposedly respond to Dr. Rocchio but do not\nsatisfy the Daubert standard. First, the expert notice—which closely parallels the defense’s\nDaubert motion—improperly discusses the facts of this particular case and comments on various\nlegal documents, even though it offers no basis whatsoever to conclude that Dr. Dietz has any legal\nexpertise or has reliably applied any expertise to the facts of this case. In particular, the notice\nstates that Dr. Dietz will opine that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on grooming “carries the risk of\nimputing motive and intent to the Defendant” (Ex. A at 3), that “Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of ‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,”\nand that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for herself,”\nbut instead that she “recruited and groomed minors to provide sexualized massages for Mr.\nEpstein” (id. at 4). These opinions, while potentially relevant to the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of a\nDaubert motion, are not properly put before a jury.\n\nSecond, certain of Dr. Dietz’s opinions about grooming are not themselves reliable or\ninvade the province of the jury. In particular, it is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive\nand intent,” because grooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. (Ex. A at 3). That is,\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming behaviors. If Dr.\nDietz’s point is that determining motive and intent is for the factfinder (id.), the Government\nagrees—and Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that grooming behaviors “impute[] motive\nand intent without adequate evidence.” (/d.) The adequacy of the evidence is a question for the\njury.

But this commonplace truth does not need\ntestimony from a psychiatric expert.\n\nThe concept of hindsight bias is well within the ken of the average juror. “Hindsight bias\nis a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’” Adams v. Lab. Corp. of\nAm., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). The prevalence of this common saying shous that\njurors plainly understand the ways in which hindsight can bias one’s perspective. As such, expert\ntestimony on it is unnecessary and inappropriate. See id. (“[C]ommon-sense concepts are\nespecially appropriate for <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by a jury.”); see also, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273\nF.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely\nto lay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited)). To whatever extent the Court believes further\nemphasis on this point is helpful, it can give the jury appropriate and neutral instructions to guide\nits deliberations. What the defense cannot do is skew the jury’s deliberations by puting an expert\nimprimatur on testimony that states, in effect, that the jurors should second-guess their assessments\nof the evidence because they are subject to hindsight bias. This inversion of the courtroom roles—\nin which a party’s witness sits in judgment of the jurors—is prejudicial and usurps the function\nboth of the jurors and of the Court in instructing the jury. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364\n(“Whereas an expert may be uniquely qualified by experience to assist the trier of fact, he is not\nqualified to compete with the judge in the function of instructing the jury.”).\n\nIf Dr. Dietz’s testimony on hindsight bias is helpful to the jury in this case, testimony of\nthis sort would become central to the court system.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\ncourse of l year in which all three men were charged with rape and pub-\nlicly vilified. The lacrosse season was cancelled, and the coach was fired.\nAccording to some, a large amount of evidence was withheld from the pub-\nlic that may have cast suspicion on the accusation, all while the reputations\nof the three accused men were continually besmirched (Hemmens, 2oo8;\nSetrakian, 2oo7). DNA evidence revealed no physical evidence that any of\nthe three men had raped her. Magnum also came under the suspicion of\nthe authorities by telling conflicting versions of the sexual assault. In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly identified the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006281.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo7\nIntoxication\nAs a prerequisite for this pathway, the consumption of intoxicating sub-\nstances must have led to distortions in information processing. There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual assault perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual assault cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating substance), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often sufficient evidence to convict someone of rape.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed penetration when\nno penetration occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at sufficient levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN) Ale \\) i 4/ll/2l\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAt the November l, 2o2l pretrial conference, the Court directed the parties to file a joint\nleter regarding protections for witness identities at trial. In particular, the Court directed the\nparties to: (l) provide nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected, (2) propose\nprocedures for voir dire related to witness identities, (3) submit a proposed instruction to the jury\nregarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address\nthe logistics of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information.\nBelou are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this leter\ncontains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the\nCourt accept the Government’s proposed redactions to this leter.\n\nGovernment position:\nI. Nomenclature\n\nWith respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial,\nthe Government respectfully submits the follouing chart, which provides the true names of\nwitnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 54\n\n2. Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 69\nno authority indicating that more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “motivated by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand reliability of the government’s investigation.

Epstein understands that\nit is his obligation to undertake discussions with the State Atorney's Office and to use his\nbest efforts to ensure compliance with these procedures, which compliance will be necessary\nto satisfy the United States’ interest. Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use\nhis best efforts to convince the Judge of the l5th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein's binding\nrecommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to\n\ndo so will be a breach of the agreement.\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation\nin the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions\nof this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges\n\n. against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Serah Kellen,\n\nAdriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova. Further, upon execution of this\nagreement and a plea agreement with the State Atorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury .\ninvestigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held\nin abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement. The\ndefendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to quash certain\ngrand jury subpoenas.

Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006619.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 4\nInternational Society for the Study and Treatment of Trauma and Dissociation\n(ISSTD)\n2oo4 Continuing Education in Forensic Psychology (2l hours)\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP)\nAdvanced Topics in Criminal Forensic Assessment\nForensic Consultation, Expertise & Testimony\nForensic Mental Health Assessment: Principles and Cases\n2ool Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, Levels I & If (34 hours)\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing International Association\n(EMDRIA)\n\nl999 - 2ooo Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Intensive Training, Parts I & II (72 hours)\nBehavioral Technology Transfer Group\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nBailey, T.D. & Rocchio, L.M.

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)).

She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise\nin treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this patern of behavior, and she\nteaches residents about trauma psychology.

This patern of coercive atachment\nis not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, atached as\nExhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her\ntestimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2ol8)\n' The concepts of atachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,\nincluding: (l) the use of atention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual\ndesensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the\nvictim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to\n“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature\nand theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2oo6) (“Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders\nmay do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe\nit will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may\ntarget children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation\nomited)).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo672o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span> needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006854.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 45\nAlaggia et al. 277\ndialogical simply means to participate in dialogue.

That questionnaire will\n\n6 prescreen for what I see as the major for-cause strike issues\n\n7 in the case. So, for example, the trial's length and schedule,\n8 a juror's personal knouledge of the parties, extent of a\n\n9 juror's awareness of publicity about the case and the\n\nlo defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a result of the\nll nature of the charges. This sort of questionnaire is, of\n\nl2 course, very common in high-profile cases. I transmited my\n\nl3 draft questionnaire to counsel yesterday, and we'll discuss it\nl4 shortly.\n\nl5 As they typically do, the clerk's office will randomly\nl6 assign juror numbers and create a corresponding list of names\nl7 and juror numbers for the prospective jurors. That list will\nl8 go to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nl9 On the questionnaire itself, jurors will be identified only by\n2o their assigned juror number. We will refer to the jurors in\n2l court throughout the process by their juror numbers only.\n22 The jury department will administer the questionnaire\n23 in morning and afternoon panels on November 4th, 5th and l2th.\n24 The procedure between questionnaires and voir dire will be as\n25 follous:\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 Filed ll/l5/2l Page9of43 9\nLalWmaxC\n\nl have live feeds of the proceedings.\n\n2 The D.E.'S Office will facilitate these arrangements,\n3 and I am grateful in advance to them as well as for the thought\n4 that they've already put into this process.\n\n5 That's hou we'll work.

In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons.

If this “compartmentalization” prevented Ms. Maxwell from having the\nrequired knouledge or intent (an ultimate issue for the jury to decide, on which Dr. Dietz will\nnot opine), then she will be not guilty.

In any case, if the Court is\nconcemed about any potential for Dr. Dietz’s testimony to engender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell,\nthe Court can give a limiting instruction.

In White, the\n\n2 court determined that a prior charging decision was admissible\n3 because it bore directly on the credibility of a witness that\n\n4 testified at the defendant's trial.\n\nS As currently proffered by the defense, the rationale\n\n6 doesn't apply here. For example, according to the defense, an\n7 alleged victim's statement to the FBI previously did not\n\n8 implicate or exculpate Ms. Maxwell, but her statement today\n\n9 does implicate her. On the basis of that statement, and\n\nlo assumedly other evidence available to them and a host of\n\nll reasons, officials in the Southern District of Florida decided\nl2 to not indict Ms. Maxwell at that time. That charging decision\nl3 could be understood as a determination that in 2oo8 the\n\nl4 government lacked sufficient evidence of Ms. Maxwell's guilt,\nl5 but the decision not to charge -- or it could mean any number\nl6 of a host of reasons, but the decision not to charge has litle\nl7 probative value that the Court can see as to this case.\n\nl8 Charging decisions, as I said, are made for a host of\nl9 reasons.

First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v.

We think that the item filed must be relevant to\nthe performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be\ndesignated a judicial document.”). Moreover, Ms. Maxwell anticipates moving to strike the\npleadings and, if stricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike\nsuch material from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document” and would enjoy no\npresumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the public has a\nright of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that “[b]efore any such\ncommon law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude that the documents at issue\nare indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9. “Once the court has determined that\nthe documents are judicial documents and that therefore a common law presumption of access\nataches, it must determine the weight of that presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the\nweight of the presumption of access, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against\nit.” Jd. at l2o.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009063.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 62 of 66\nrender that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim.

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record. Incorporating the factual allegations in the conspiracy count, Count Twenty\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page5of2l\n\nThe Defendant urges this Court to resolve the motion on the papers, without the need for\na hearing. Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2—l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nII. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page6of2l\nBaker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Moon, 7l8 F.2d\nl2lo, l234 (2d Cir. l983)). Mere “[g]ossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4). Rather, “[a]llegations of\nimpropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and\nrelevant evidence.’” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o,\n543 (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard. Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2o22, at 8\nn.4. But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard. And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in Tanner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9547\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel4of2l\nDefendant’s ultimate guilt. Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.””» Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in Tanner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel5of2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing. See Bin Laden,\n2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2. Notably, this case is far from United States v. Colombo, where the\nSecond Circuit ordered an evidentiary hearing on the basis of two sworn affidavits that identified\nanother juror by name and described with particularity the alleged misconduct. 869 F.2d l49,\nl5l (2d Cir. l989).\n\nThe Court therefore rejects the Defendant’s as-applied constitutional challenge to Rule\n6o6 and further concludes that Rule 6o6 bars the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Juror 5o’s statements\nabout the second juror. Even if the Court considered Juror 5o’s statement about another juror,\nthe evidence would be insufficient to meet the high threshold for an inquiry. Without\nnonspeculative evidence of misconduct by any juror but Juror 5o, the Court restricts the focus of\nthe evidentiary hearing to Juror 5o. See Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544.°\nIV. The nature of the hearing\n\nA. The Court will examine the witnesses and the parties may submit questions\n\nIn concluding that an inquiry into Juror 5o’s conduct is warranted, the Court is mindful\nthat the “object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible\nharm to other interests.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 666. Accordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s\nrequest that counsel directly question the juror—a decision commited to this Court’s “sound\ndiscretion.” Jd. at 667; see also Ianniello, 866 F.2d at 544 (“We leave it to the district court’s\ndiscretion to decide the extent to which the parties may participate in questioning the witnesses,\nand whether to hold the hearing in camera.”). The Court will conduct the questioning at the\n® The Defendant’s briefing is unclear as to whether she seeks to question the other ll jurors only to identify the juror\nimplicated by the news article, or if she would seek to question the other jurors in any event to determine “what\nJuror No. 5o said to the other jurors.” See Maxwell Br. at 49. To the extent the Defendant is requesting the ability\nto question jurors about what Juror 5o allegedly disclosed during deliberations, that request is denied as it is plainly\nforeclosed by Rule 6o6.

Moreover, because the Court has already ruled that the Court\nwill conduct the questioning of Juror 5o, and because the parties have had an opportunity to submit\nquestions for the Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in advance of the hearing (id. at l6-l7), the defendant does\n' Defense counsel’s leter notes that Ms. Sternheim has a trial scheduled to start the follouing\nweek, on March l6, 2o22, but the Government notes that Ms. Sternheim is one of multiple defense\natorneys in that case as well.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 62 of 66\nrender that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We think that\nthe item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.”’). Moreover, if\nstricken, the documents enjoy no presumption of public access. Broun v. Maxwell, 929\nF.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9) ([under Civil Rule l2], “the district court may strike such\nmaterial from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or\nscandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant to the\nperformance of the judicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial document”\nand would enjoy no presumption of public access.”).\n\nThe Second Circuit established a framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6) for courts to utilize in determining when the\npublic has a right of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that\n“Tb]efore any such common law right can atach, houever, a court must first conclude\nthat the documents at issue are indeed ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9.\n“Once the court has determined that the documents are judicial documents and that\ntherefore a common law presumption of access ataches, it must determine the weight of\nthat presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the weight of the presumption of\naccess, the court must ‘balance competing considerations against it.’” Jd. at l2o.\n\nThere exists no compelling reason to release Juror No. 5o’s pleadings. Any public\nrelease of the documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and\ncommentary, all of which ls prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s\nrights to fair and impartial proceedings.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 26 of 32\n2. The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias\nmay be based.\n\nMoreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the\ngovernment. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 5o’s intent, whether he acted\ndeliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias. . . .”\nGreer, 285 F.3d at l73. An analysis of Juror No. 5o’s intent requires <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the totality\nof the circumstances. And if only because Juror No. 5o has a patern and practice of giving false\nanswers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell is not required to accept any post-hoc assertion by him that\nhe did not act deliberately. Cf United States v. James, 6o9 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. l979) (“[W]hen\natempting to shou bias or interest, as opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not bound to\naccept the witness’ answer, but is free to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).\n\nThe government disingenuously suggests that the Court \"need not inquire about the\ndetails of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did not probe such details with respect to\nother jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively.\" Resp. at 34 n.l6. Apparently the\ngovernment has forgoten that Question 48a itself (approved of by the government) asked for\ndetails of any affirmative answer to Question 48, and each of the other jurors who answered 48\nin the affirmative provided those details in writen form when they answered Question 48a.\nThere was thus no need for the Court to inquire the details during the live voir dire. For\nexample, the government points to Juror l89 and notes the Court only folloued up with the\nquestion whether a question concerning ability to be fair and impartial. Resp. at 36.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required disclosure of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to disclosure. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

The jury acquited Parse of the conspiracy count and three counts of tax evasion. Those\nconvictions stemmed from David Parse’s integral role in one of the largest tax fraud schemes ever\ncharged, the details of which are spelled out in the indictment against him, $3 o9 Cr. 58l (WHP),\nand the trial record.

(Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have convicted even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\nconcluded that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\namendment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel6 of 24\nF.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document65o _ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagelof2\n: U.S. Department of Justice\nSs United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process.

Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the questionnaire, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate.

At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the questionnaire was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions.

Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires.

And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire.

Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 34 of 45\nran the risk of moving the jury away from <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the core of criminality alleged in the\nIndictment.®\n\nThe appropriate approach was to instruct the jury on the one and only predicate state\noffense for the Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774-75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 49 of 77\nGhislaine is educated and hard-working. She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be associated\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page5lof 77\nISABEL MAXWELL\nll42o SANTA MONICA BLVD #25424\nLOS ANGELES, CA 9oo25\n\nMay l8, 2o22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Houever, certain aspects\nof the defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s request for a reduced sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter. The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable\nprivileges as a high-profile inmate that vastly exceed the benefits accorded to the average inmate.\nIt is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her\nlife as a prisoner, but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much less\nthe extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks.\n\nIf anything stands out from the defendant’s sentencing submission, it is her complete\nfailure to address her offense conduct and her uter lack of remorse. Instead of shouing even a\nhint of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant makes a desperate atempt to cast blame\nwherever else she can. On that score, the defendant’s atempt to cast aspersions on the Government\nfor prosecuting her, and her claim that she is being held responsible for Epstein’s crimes, are both\nabsurd and offensive. Maxwell was an adult who made her oun choices. She made the choice to\nsexually exploit numerous underage girls. She made the choice to conspire with Epstein for years,\nworking as partners in crime and causing devastating harm to vulnerable victims. She should be\nheld accountable for her disturbing role in an extensive child exploitation scheme.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel8of55\n\nIn a memorandum dated June l5, 2o22, the defendant urges the Court to adopt a sentencing\nrange of 5l to 63 months’ imprisonment, which reflects a small fraction of the applicable\nsentencing Guidelines range. The defendant reaches this lou number by disputing four aspects of\nthe Probation Office’s calculation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should reject the\ndefendant’s Guidelines objections in their entirety. It would be both strange and anomalous for\nthe Sentencing Guidelines to recommend such a short sentence for a defendant who spent years\nsexually exploiting teenage girls. The Sentencing Guidelines do not provide for a such an\noutcome.\n\nA. The 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual Applies\n\nIn the ordinary course, the Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to use the Guidelines\nManual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced, which here would result in applying\nthe 2o2l Guidelines Manual (the “2o2l Manual”). U.S.S.G. § lBl.ll(a). Where, as here, the\ncurrent Guidelines Manual provides a higher range than the Manual in effect at the time of the\noffense conduct, using the current manual would violate the Ex Post Facto clause. U.S.S.G.\n§ lBl.ll(b)(l); Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 53o, 544 (2ol3). Here, the 2o2l Manual calls\nfor a substantially higher guidelines calculation than the Government seeks. For example, under\nthe 2o2l Manual, the base offense level would be 3o before any enhancements are applied,\nwhereas the 2oo4 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the “2oo4 Manual’) provides for a base offense\nlevel of 24 before enhancements. In other words, under the 2o2l Manual, the offense level is at\nleast six levels higher. Compare U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a) (2oo4) with U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(a)(2) (2o2l).\nAs a result, the Court may not apply the 2o2l Manual, but the Supreme Court has made clear that\nsubsequent increases in the Guidelines may be a reason the sentencing court may deviate upwards\nfrom the applicable Guidelines, and sentencing courts are “free to give careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 23 oof55\nemployees was unnecessary. The book is authentic, and the defendant offers no basis for\nconcluding otherwise.”\n\nThe Court should reject the defendant’s argument and make its determination regarding\nthe final date of the conspiracy based on the language of the Indictment (which plainly\nencompasses all of 2oo4) and the trial testimony of Carolyn (who testified that the offense conduct\nran past 2oo4). The 2oo4 Manual applies.\n\n3. The Court Should Apply the 2oo4 Manual\n\nThe defendant also claims that the “goals of sentencing are not served” by applying the\n2oo4 Manual. (Def. Mem. 8 (capitalization removed)). Not so. The law plainly provides that the\n2oo4 Manual applies here, and it would be unjust to provide a substantial break in the Sentencing\nGuidelines for a defendant who engaged in an extensive child exploitation scheme, especially\nwhen both Congress and the Sentencing Commission have since further increased the applicable\npenalties for these offenses.\n\nMoreover, the Court should not credit the defendant’s claim that she broke away from\nEpstein in 2oo2, based on the testimony of a sole defense witness who said that the defendant had\n“moved on” in 2oo2. (Def. Mem. 9).

It is well established that hearsay is admissible at sentencing.\nSee United States v.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A.

Beyond my initial\ndescription to my boyfriend and family of what occurred when I was with them in New Mexico, I\ndidn’t talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away,\nand so I did the best I could.\n\nThe world did not cooperate with this strategy, houever. Something would bring to mind\nthis experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I’d feel\nirritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented. In recent years, I have been asked repeatedly\nto describe these crimes to law enforcement and the media, and I have learned heartbreaking details\nabout the ways Maxwell and Epstein abused and exploited so many others. Focusing on these\nexperiences that I tried so hard to avoid thinking about has forced me to acknouledge the many\nripple effects of their crimes for myself and my family and the continued impact of these long-ago\nevents on my life.\n\nOne of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss\nof trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts.

It\nwas like a roller coaster ride, designed to disorient and disempouer me as a vulnerable, young\ngirl, for the sole purpose of providing me to Epstein for sexual abuse.\nThe best way to imprison someone, is to make them create the prison bars in their oun mind, to\ninstill enough fear to make sure they never risk leaving or disobeying and make the bars invisible\nto everyone, so that no one can see their cage, or hear their silent screams.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document674 _ Filed o6/24/22 Page 8 of 29\nBOIES\nSGHILLER\nes FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

Laraneta, 7oo F.3d 983, 987 (7th Cir. 2ol2). The\nSeventh Circuit explained that the federal “Criminal Code makes clear that “[n]o limitation shall be\nplaced on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted\nof an offense, which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of\nimposing an appropriate sentence’.” 775 at 952 (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 366l).\n\nThis Court should follou the same approach and hear from all victims of Maxwell’s long—\nrunning and. wide-ranging sex trafficking conspiracy. See also United States v. Goss, 325 F. Supp. 3d\n932, 936 (E.D.

A\nmotion in limine is a “pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or\noffered at trial.” Black’s Law Dictionary (llth ed. 2ol9).\nA motion under Rule 4l2 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking\npermission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive\nmotion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, and\ndetermination. Fed. R. Evid. 4l2(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under\nits terms—l4 days before trial. Fed. R.

Indeed, defense counsel have encountered significant resistance from\nformer Epstein employees and acquaintances concerning their willingness or availability to\ntestify because of fear related to unfavorable publicity should their names be publicly associated\nwith Mr. Epstein. Numerous witnesses have refused to be interviewed, professed a lack of\nknouledge or memory, and actively avoided service of process because of the fear of public\nretaliation.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Constitution grants Ms. Maxwell the right to present a defense and to compulsory\nprocess. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. It also guarantees her effective assistance of counsel. U.S.\nConst amend. VI.

Mot. in Limine, p 8 (citing cases).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhen this Court read its preliminary instructions to the jury, it said:\n\nAs I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to\n\nreceive significant atention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permited\n\nwitnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name\n\nor a pseudonym.

The\nlogic of allouing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of\ncounsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> given the\ngovernment’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are\nsignificant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not\naffect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,\nMs. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it\npermited Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Mat, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be\nprecluded from sketching their faces.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page2of25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Evid. 4o8. For at least three reasons, Rule 4o8 does not apply here.\n\nFirst, the Rule only prohibits evidence of compromise when the disputed claim is the\nsame claim that was compromised. As the Second Circuit has held, “Evidence of an offer to\ncompromise, though otherwise barred by Rule 4o8, can fall outside the Rule if it is offered for\n‘another purpose,’ i.e., for a purpose other than to prove or disprove the validity of the claims\nthat the offers were meant to setle.” Trebor Sportswear Co. v.

The documents sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o8.\n\nThe subpoena should also be quashed because the records sought are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o8. Rule l7(c), in general, authorizes subpoenas returnable before\ntrial, as well as subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” United States v.\nDonziger, No. l9-CR-56l (LAP), 2o2l WL l865376, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l). The test\nset forth in Nixon “governs both varieties” of subpoenas. Donziger, 2o2l WL l865376, at *4.\nUnder Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)\nspecificity.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the\nadmissibility hurdle, because Rule 4o8 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,\ninadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 4o8(a), evidence of accepting a valuable <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to compromise a\nclaim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are\n“not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a\ndisputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o8(a). Inadmissibility under Rule 4o8 provides a basis to quash a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See\nSee Order, dated Feb. l6, 2o2l (ECF No. l2o), at 2 in Farmer v.

United States, 87 F.3d 5o, 5l\n(2d Cir. l996). But in 2oo6, the rule was amended to make clear that it applies in that\ncircumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In 2oo6 the Supreme Court promulgated an\namendment to Rule 4o8 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect on\nDecember l, 2oo6) applies to criminal cases.” United States v.

And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether disclosure, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against disclosure, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\nNorthwest, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 29 of 3l\nUnseal at 3. Had the Government’s motion made clear that these records are redundant of the\nevidence at Maxwell’s public trial, the victims’ responses to the motion to unseal might well\nhave been different.\n\nVarious leters also express alarm or dismay at other recently reported, or anticipated,\nGovernment actions regarding Maxwell.'® These concerns, houever, are properly directed to the\npolitical branches. The Court has not considered them in resolving the motion to unseal.\n\nll. The Systemic Interest in Grand Jury Secrecy\n\nA final <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> is systemic. “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system\ndepends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 2l8. For\nthat reason, the Supreme Court has instructed louer courts “considering the effects of disclosure\non grand jury proceedings” to assess “the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand\njuries,” mindful that “[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their\ntestimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.” /d. at 222; see also Procter & Gamble\nCo., 356 U.S. at 682 (“The grand jury as a public institution serving the community might suffer\nif those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrou.”);\nBaker v. U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s possession that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015173.jpg": "EPSTEIN VICTIMS’ COMPENSATION PROGRAM (“EVCP”)\nEa ee |\nGENERAL RELEASE\nThis General Release is made this 3'o__ day of October 2o2o _.\nsini REDACTION\nWHEREAS, (the “Claimant’), submited a claim for\ncompensation to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (“EVCP”) asserting that\nshe is a victim of sexual abuse by Jeffrey E.

Subject to Ms. Maxwell’s request to temporarily pause the process as described\nabove, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we\nhope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing\nmove ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to\nnotify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the\nunsealing before deciding hou to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the\nCourt and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are\nlimitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in\nthe past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the\nexcerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see\nhis or her oun information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from\na Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to\nsend to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of\nparticipating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed\nto Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement.\n\nWe also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the\nOriginal Parties to object and to respond from l4 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs\n2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the\nProtocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at l4\ndays given some practical considerations applicable to them.\n\nAlthough the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of\nPlaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements.\n\nFirst, we carefully considered the Court’s suggestion to reduce the number of pages of\nbriefing to ten pages per side. /d. Our initial Objection (DE lo57) was l4 pages long;\nPlaintiff’s Response was l9 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many\nrespects, not specific enough.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions.

The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See\nDkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some\ndelay of disclosure, see Dkt.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020193.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPAeht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePage 2l65l2\nprovided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her\nsecond motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\ncombination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020198.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas22F2I9 ePagei7 l6l2\nof the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020215.jpg": "Cased 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAtl BU l FROG O22o6/2agFAageo’ 6l6\n\nhearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance as required and the safety of any other person and the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted.

On December 8, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on l2/28/2o)(jw) (Entered: l2/28/2o2o)\n\nl2/3o/2o2o | lo5 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v.

And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Nathan on\n5/l4/2o2l) (nl) (Entered: o5/l4/2o2l)\n\no5/l4/2o2l | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2o2l, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell\nwrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with\nparticular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other\nfactual shouing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every l5\nminutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The\nGovernment shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for\nthe MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Case returned to Judge Nathan. (bw) (Entered: o4/ol/2o22)\n\no4/ol/2o22 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

(Rohrbach,\nAndrew) (Entered: o4/25/2o22)\n\no4/26/2o22 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nregarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.\nNo. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that\nadvancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their\nsentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing\nsubmission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\ndisclosure; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the\nCourt must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\"\n(ll) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i)\nbalance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting\ndisclosure.\" Id. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (\"Amodeo II\")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that\nthe Defendant's leter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function\nand useful in the judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for\npurposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"),\n44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put\nforthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the\nletersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to\ndocket the redacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons\noutlined in the Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (ll) assess the weight of the\ncommon law presumption of access to the materials; and (ll) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

In balancing competing considerations against the\npresumption of access, houever, the Court finds that the proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyers’ clients in other\nmaters and to allou defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under\nthe rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket the redacted\nversion of her leter by April 23, 2o2l.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that advancing\nthe PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their sentencing\nsubmissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing submission\nschedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, the Court\nORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 - First PSR disclosure;\nMay 3l, 2o22 - Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 - Government response due; June\n9, 2o22 - Second PSR disclosure; June l5, 2o22 - Defendant sentencing submission due;\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l 97/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020762.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel44 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3 of 34\nI, Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution\n\nIn September 2oo7, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey\nEpstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. l42 at l-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to\nplead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen\nmonths in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Atorney’s Office agreed not to charge him\nwith federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his\nconduct between 2ool and 2oo7. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of\nhis “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nAs a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility\nobserved, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.\nOPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 2o4-3, at x, 8o, l75, l79, 26o-6l. The U.S. Atorney’s\npromise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal\npractice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with litle\ndiscussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by the prosecutors.” /d. at l69, l85. The report concluded that the\nU.S. Atorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,\nbut nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” /d. at l69.\n\nOnly the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell\ncontends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of\nJeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal\nlimitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second\nCircuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New\nYork. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the $l superseding indictment.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020775.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5/7 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6 of 34\nHouever, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to\nthese charges.\n\nAt Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past\nconduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively\nimpermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under\nexisting laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or ataches a new disability, in\nrespect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting\nLandgraf, 5ll U.S. at 29o). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-\nbarred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.\nLitig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet\nexpired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 89o (2d Cir. l995).\n\nMaxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when\nCongress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.\nMaxwell contends that it is unfair to allou the Government to prosecute her nou for conduct that\noccurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the pouer to set a\nlengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the\ndifficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a\ndefendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy\njudgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that\n§ 3283 allous her prosecution nou.\n\nB. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process\n\n“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the\nprimary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v. Cornielle,\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o775\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020784.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel66 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 34\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the\nMann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party’s atorney\npresents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d. Disqualification of counsel also implicates\nMaxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWE), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the atorneys who\nrepresented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with\nthe facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o-7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020785.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel67 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26 of 34\n\nThe balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are commited.\nto the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d ll4l, ll49 Qd\nCir. l989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020800.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel82 of 2o8\nA-l78\nCase l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 6 of l5\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the questionnaire, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process.

As noted in the Court’s prior Opinion, also on January 5, 2o22, the Jury Department of the Southern District of\nNew York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of statements he had given to certain media\noutlets that were being widely reported on in the press, inquiring whether he needed an atorney, and asking if he\ncould receive a copy of his completed questionnaire.

At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers.

This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as\nexplained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual\nconduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact\nwith individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting\ninstruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The\ninstruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual\nactivity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the\nend of the case. Trial Tr. at 2o48-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the\ncharged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting\ninstructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.\nThat was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a\nminor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.\nThe Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2loo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021017.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel9l of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 34 of 45\nran the risk of moving the jury away from <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the core of criminality alleged in the\nIndictment.®\n\nThe appropriate approach was to instruct the jury on the one and only predicate state\noffense for the Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. For that reason, the Court also rejected the Defendant’s request to repeat in the charge\nthe limiting instructions as to Kate’s and Annie’s testimony and the Defendant’s request, raised.\nfor the first time at the charging conference and well after completion of her testimony, to\ninclude an unspecified limiting instruction as to Jane’s New Mexico testimony. Trial Tr. at\n2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony, the jury had yet to be instructed on the meaning of\n“illegal sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” But it was unnecessary to repeat the\nlimiting instructions alongside the charge’s definition of “illegal sexual activity.” Jd. at 2774—75.\nThe jury nou had that phrase clearly defined as a violation of New York Penal Law Section\nl3o.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict the Defendant only on\nthe predicate state offense of New York law. The jury is presumed to have folloued these\ninstructions. See United States v. Joyner, 3l3 F.3d 4o, 47 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nAt botom, the Defendant asks the Court to speculate based on an ambiguous note that\nthe jury disregarded Jane’s substantial testimony about travel to New York and sexual conduct in\nNew York and further assumed a violation of New York law could be based on conduct only in\nNew Mexico.

Al75.\n\nAfter detailing the terms of the agreement as they relate to Epstein, the NPA\nlays out the follouing provision:\n\nIn <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills\n\nall of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also\nagrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana\n\nRoss, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\n\nAl78 (emphasis added).\n\nThe NPA clearly distinguishes “the United States” from the USAO-SDEFL,\nrepeatedly referring explicitly to the later where such a limitation is intended.\nThus, the NPA’s references to the “United States” demonstrate a definitional intent\nnot to limit such provisions to the USAO-SDEL. Unlike the provision that Epstein\nwill not be prosecuted “in this District” (Al75), the sentence regarding co-\nconspirators contains no provision limiting co-conspirators’ immunity to the\nSDFL; no limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators\nof Epstein” cannot be prosecuted, and no language limiting its binding effect on\nother USAOs, as standard agreements typically do.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021117.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/o of ll3\nthe Landgraf test.” Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4o8 (citing Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 262-\n63); see also Martin v.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021194.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22 of 258\nSA-2o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 348\nI.

Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been identified and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia identified documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had identified specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez.

He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an\nassessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks presented by the case.*! Sloman added\nthat he did not knou hou a two-year sentence might have related to specific charges or to either\nstate or federal sentencing guidelines. Lourie likewise told OPR he did not recall hou the two-year\nterm was decided upon, or by whom, but he speculated that it may have been presented by the\ndefense as the most Epstein would accept, and that the decision would have been reached by\nAcosta follouing “extended <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, research, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, Lourie, and Villafafia. **\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a two-year plea deal with Acosta or\nwho reached the decision that two years was an appropriate sentence. Menchel also told OPR,\nhouever, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,\nEpstein would have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to take\nthe case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there was a real risk that the USAO might lose at trial,\nand in so doing, might cause more trauma to the victims, particularly those who were reluctant to\ntestify. Menchel told OPR that he did not believe that anyone at the time looked at two years “as\na fair result in terms of the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not\nif we took this case to trial, would we risk losing everything,” and “if we. . . felt we could have\ngoten more time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that “I had decided and endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some\npoint,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some days or a\nweek or two.” As noted earlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in this case merely\nas a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he explained to OPR was “a polite way of saying[,\n‘Jencouraging the state to do a litle bit more.[’]”®’ Acosta said that he understood two years’\nimprisonment to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original charges the\nPBPD was considering at the outset of the state investigation.** Acosta also told OPR that he\n\nthe atorney for the government has a continuing obligation to assist the court in\n\nits determination of the sentence to be imposed. The prosecutor must be familiar\n\nwith the guidelines generally and with the specific guideline provisions applicable\n\nto his or her case. In discharging these duties, the atorney for the government\n\nshould . . . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information\n\nupon which the sentencing decisions will be based.\n8l In Sloman’s view, Menchel and Lourie were “two of the finest trial lawyers” in the USAO.\n82 Lourie noted that Sloman and Menchel were “two extraordinarily experienced people in [Acosta’s] front\noffice who had tried . . . gobs and gobs of cases.”\nBS In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney asserted that OPR’s use of Acosta’s quote, “a litle\nbit more,” “unfairly minimized” Acosta’s and the USAO’s efforts to achieve justice in this case. Acosta’s atorney\nalso asserted that the phrase was “clearly soft-spoken understatement,” that the terms obtained were “substantially\nmore onerous than the state’s alternative resolution,” and that Acosta was “clearly declining the invitation to take the\nState to task and soft-pedaling an obvious distinction.”\n\nSA OPR examined this assertion and was unable to verify that the proposed two-year term of imprisonment\ncorresponded with the charges that the PBPD considered at the outset of the state investigation or with the charge in\n5o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l25o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021313.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l39 3536o38, Pagel4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l39 of 348\nDershouitz, Lefkouitz and Starr.”'’’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he\nreceived communications from Dershouitz, Starr, and Lefkouitz, who “all sought to make peace”\nwith him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in\nfederal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined\nthe petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in\nChapter Three of this Report.\n\nB. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release\n\nA few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was\nincarcerated at the lou-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county\nprisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein\nwas eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be\nincarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed\nexplicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s\nacceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as\nanother special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allou Epstein into the work\nrelease program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, OPR did not investigate whether\nany state, county, or Sheriff’s Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to\nensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.\n\nThe first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,\nwhen Lefkouitz asserted, in his October 23, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s\nsentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence\navailable to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”\n\nIn November 2oo7, Sloman had an exchange of leters with Lefkouitz about the USAO’s\nunderstanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”\npointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted\nthat Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allou individuals registered as sexual\noffenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release\nprogram. Sloman concluded that the USAO “is puting you on notice that it intends to make certain\nthat Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no beter and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same\noffense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the\nreasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78\n\nHouever, also in November, State Atorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,\neligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place\nce Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The Daily\nBeast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknouledged that\nit could have occurred.\n\nl78 Sloman provided a draft of this leter to Acosta for his approval before the leter was sent to Lefkouitz.\nll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021320.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 4G 3536o38, Pagel48 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 348\naffirmative steps the atorney reasonably believed were required to comply with an obligation or\nstandard.\nIl. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nA, The United States Atorneys’ Manual\n\nAmong its many provisions, the United States Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes\ngeneral statements of principles that summarize appropriate considerations to be weighed, and\ndesirable practices to be folloued, by federal prosecutors when discharging their prosecutorial\nresponsibilities.'8? The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial\nauthority and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration of the Federal criminal laws,” and\nto promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and\nobjectively on the merits of each case.” USAM § 9-27.ool.\n\nBecause the USAM is designed to assist in structuring the decision-making process of\ngovernment atorneys, many of its principles are cast in general terms, with a view to providing\nguidance rather than mandating results. [d.; see also USAM § 9-27.l2o, comment (“It is expected\nthat each Federal prosecutor will be guided by these principles in carrying out his/her criminal law\nenforcement responsibilities . ... Houever, it is not intended that reference to these principles will\nrequire a particular prosecutorial decision in any given case.”); USAM § 9-27.llo, comment\n(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in determining when,\nwhom, hou, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law.”).\nHouever, USAM § 9-27.l3o provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal\nprosecution articulated in the USAM may be subject to internal discipline. In particular, USAM\n§ 9-27.l3o states that each U.S. Atorney should establish internal office procedures to ensure that\nprosecutorial decisions are made at an appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with\nthe principles set forth in the USAM, and that serious, unjustified departures from the principles\nset forth in the USAM are folloued by remedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary\nsanctions when warranted and deemed appropriate.\n\nU.S. Atorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal criminal maters” and may\nmodify or depart from the principles set forth in the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of\nfair and effective law enforcement within their individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool,\n9.27-l4o. The USAM provisions are supplemented by the Department’s Criminal Resource\nManual, which provides additional guidance relating to the conduct of federal criminal\nprosecutions.\n\nl. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation and Declination of a\nFederal Prosecution\n\nFederal prosecutors do not open a case on every mater referred to them. USAM § 9-2.o2o\nexplicitly authorizes a U.S. Atorney “to decline prosecution in any case referred directly to\n£88 In 2ol8, the USAM was revised and reissued as the Justice Manual. In assessing the subjects’ conduct, OPR\nrelies upon the standards of conduct in effect at the time of the events in issue. Accordingly, unless otherwise noted,\ncitations in this Report are to the l997 edition of the USAM, as revised through January 2oo7.\n\nl2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an impression that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021322.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l48 3536o38, Pagel5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l48 of 348\nSome offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of\nparticularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local\njurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the\noffense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the\ninvestigation was conducted primarily by state or local\ninvestigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,\nwhen it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less\nsubstantial than the interest of state or local authorities,\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> should be given to referring the case to those\nauthorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal\nprosecution.\nAnother comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the\nFederal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, atitudes, relationships or other\ncircumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a\nthorough and successful prosecution.”\n\nUSAM § 9-27.26o identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether\nto initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutor’s “oun personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutor’s oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM § 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM § 9-2.o3l, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).

The Ashcroft Memo cautioned.\nthat a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either\nthe law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft\nMemo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all\ncharges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence\nunder the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor\nto decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the writen\nor otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Atorney General, U.S. Atorney, or “designated\nsupervisory atorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be\nappropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Atorney’s Office is\n“narticularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and\nproceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.\nThe Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea\nagreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.\n\nOn January 28, 2oo5, Deputy Atorney General James Comey issued a memorandum\nentitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum\nreiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily\nprovable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial\nsentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any\nstatutorily required consecutive sentence.\n\nImportantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line\nprosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is\nplaced upon the U.S. Atorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In\naddition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allouing a prosecutor\nlS The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 22o\n(2oo5), which struck doun the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose\na sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of\nthe United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of l984. The\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2oo3, Pub.\nL. lo8-2l, ll7 Stat. 65o, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to\nimprove the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act\nprovided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple\noccasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified\nnumbers of images.\n\nl26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021329.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TES 3536o38, Pagel57 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l55 of 348\nwhen prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have\nmade clear, houever, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a\npromise of leniency touards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third\nparty if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 9o9 F.2d 738, 74l-42 (2d Cir.\nl99o) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by\nthe government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he\npled guilty); Martin v.

For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla.

The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law\nprinciples, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were\ntherefore entitled to enforce it.\n\nApart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a\nprosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.\n\nD.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM identified considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal <span class=\"highlight\">Consideration</span>\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021343.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l69 3536o38, Pagel7l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 348\n\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?’” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?”°\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have generated more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\n\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\n\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\n\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\nfinancial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\nNevertheless, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021366.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel94 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 348\nentitled to significant weight, and OPR credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the emails in\nquestion do not themselves establish that Villafafia (or any other subject) acted to improperly\nbenefit Epstein, was motivated by favoritism or other improper influences, or sought to silence\nvictims.\n\nG. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafaia Agreed to\nthe NPA’s Provision Promising Not to Prosecute “Potential Co-conspirators”\nin Order to Protect Any of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential\nAssociates\n\nOPR examined the decision by the subjects who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,\nand Acosta—to include in the agreement a provision in which the USAO agreed not to prosecute\n“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four named individuals, to determine\nwhether that provision resulted from the subjects’ improper favoritism touards Epstein or an\nimproper effort to shield from prosecution any of Epstein’s knoun associates. Other than various\ndrafts of the NPA and of a federal plea agreement, OPR found litle in the contemporaneous\nrecords mentioning the provision and nothing indicating that the subjects discussed or debated it—\nor even gave it much <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal plea agreement shou\nthat the final broad language promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”\nevolved from a more narrou provision sought by the defense. The provision expanded as Villafafia\nand defense counsel exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed federal plea agreement and, then, of the\nNPA, with apparently litle analysis and no substantive discussion within the USAO about the\nprovision.”3”\n\nAs the NPA drafting process concluded, Villafafia circulated to Lourie and another\nsupervisor a draft that contained the non-prosecution provision, telling Lourie it was “some of\n[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding promises not to prosecute other people,” and\ncommenting only, “I don’t think it hurts us.” In a reply email, Lourie responded to another issue\n237 As set forth in OPR’s factual discussion, early in the negotiations over a federal plea agreement, the defense\nsought a non-prosecution provision applicable to only four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed\nemployees of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with “standard language” referring to unnamed\n“co-conspirators” so as to avoid “highlight[ing] for the judge all of the other crimes and all of the other persons that\nwe could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA sent by Lefkouitz after Villafafia’s email continued to include\nlanguage referring to the four named assistants and unnamed employees. Villafafia, houever, internally circulated\ndrafts of a federal plea agreement that included language stating, “This agreement resolves the federal criminal liability\nof the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida grouing out of any criminal conduct by\nthose persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement.” The federal plea agreement draft revised\nby Lourie and Acosta on September 2o, 2oo7, included that language. When the defense team reverted to negotiation\nof state charges, Villafafia advised them, “In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] may be more\nwilling to be specific about not pursuing charges against others.” The next day, Lefkouitz sent a revised draft NPA\nreferring to the four named assistants, “any employee” of the named company, and “any unnamed co-conspirators for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” The language was finally revised by Villafafia\nto prohibit prosecution of “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [the four named\nassistants].”\n\nIn commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel and Lourie both noted that the non-prosecution\nprovision could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it was limited to certain specified federal charges\nand a time-limited scope of conduct. Although the non-prosecution provision in the NPA did not explicitly contain\nsuch limitations, those limitations were included in other parts of the agreement.\n\nl66\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\nequipment.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021379.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o5 3536o38, Page2o7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o5 of 348\n\nTo be clear, OPR is not suggesting that prosecutors must obtain all available evidence\nbefore reaching plea agreements or that prosecutors cannot reasonably determine that reaching a\nresolution is more beneficial than continuing to litigate evidentiary issues.

OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of\n\nIncarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It\nSatisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution\n\nThe heart of the controversy surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent undue leniency\nafforded him concerning his sentence. After offering a deal that required a “non-negotiable”\n24-month term of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it for an l8-month term of incarceration,\nknouing that gain time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served only l3 months.\nEpstein ultimately did not serve even that minimal sentence incarcerated on a full-time basis\nbecause the state alloued Epstein into its work release program within the first four months of his\nsentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything else that happened to [Epstein] is exactly what\nshould have happened to him... . He had to pay a lot of money. He had to register as a sex\noffender,” but “in the perfect world, [Epstein] would have served more time in jail.”\n\nDue to the passage of time and the subjects’ inability to recall many details of the relevant\nevents, OPR was unable to develop a clear understanding of hou the original two-year sentence\nrequirement was developed or by whom. Two possibilities were articulated during OPR’s subject\ninterviews: (l) the two years represented the sentence Epstein would have received had he pled\nguilty to an unspecified charge originally contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years\nrepresented the sentence the USAO determined Epstein would be willing to accept, thus avoiding\nthe need for a trial. As to the former possibility, Acosta told OPR that his “best understanding” of\nthe two-year proposal was that it correlated to “one of the original state charges.” He elaborated,\na8 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney objected to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or\nshould have knoun about the litigation regarding the computers and that he should have given greater <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nto pursuing the computers before the NPA was signed. Acosta’s atorney asserted that Acosta was not involved in\nthat level of “granularity”; that his ““‘small thoughts’ edits” on the NPA were limited and focused on policy; and that\nit was appropriate for him to rely on his staff to raise any issues of concern to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR\nnonetheless concludes that having developed a unique resolution to a federal investigation, Acosta had a greater\nobligation to understand and consider what the USAO was giving up and the appropriateness of doing so.\n\nl79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021382.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page2lo of 258\nSA-2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a difficult trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE, Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span>, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021406.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page234 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\n\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””° Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing... . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\n\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\n\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\n\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\n\nto do but... it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\n\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\n\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. ... I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.”°° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\nana Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAQ].”\n\n226 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> required under the circumstances.

Maxwell Br. at 28. But resolving the motion nou would require the Court to accept\nas true Juror 5o’s unsworn statements made to media outlets. Moreover, in arguing for a new\ntrial based on the current record, the Defendant relies extensively on statements prohibited from\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> by Rule 6o6. E.g., Maxwell Br. at l2-l4 (describing Juror 5o’s statements in\ndeliberation and other jurors’ reactions). The Defendant also urges the Court to reach factual\nconclusions that are unavailable on the current record; for example, that Juror 5o deliberately\nlied in failing to disclose that he was the victim of sexual abuse. See Maxwell Br. at 39-43.\nFinally, the Defendant cites no authority—nor is the Court aware of any—in which a court\ngranted a new trial under the McDonough standard without first conducting an evidentiary\nhearing. As the Second Circuit has instructed, “if any significant doubt as to a juror’s\nimpartiality remains in the wake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an\nevidentiary hearing generally should be held.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d\nCir. 2oo6) (citing United States v. Boney, 977 F.2d 624, 634 (D.C. Cir. l992)). The Court\ntherefore denies the Defendant’s motion to grant a new trial on the current record.\nIf. Evidentiary hearing\n\nFor the reasons outlined belou, the Court determines that a hearing must be held\nregarding Juror 5o’s alleged nondisclosure during the jury selection process.\n\nA. Threshold for an evidentiary hearing\n\nBecause of the importance of finality of judgments, the threshold for conducting a post-\nverdict inquiry is high. A post-verdict inquiry into juror misconduct is conducted only “when\nthere is clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative\nimpropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.” United States v.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021530.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pageloo of 2l7\nSA-354\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 6 of 2l\nBaker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v.

Rather, “[a]llegations of\nimpropriety must be ‘concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and\nrelevant evidence.’” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o (quoting United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o,\n543 (2d Cir. l989)).\n\nThe Defendant argues that this is the wrong standard. Maxwell Reply, Feb. 9, 2o22, at 8\nn.4. But the Defendant does not identify an alternative standard. And the Second Circuit has\napplied precisely this standard to determine whether a district court should hold a McDonough\nhearing on the basis of a juror’s nondisclosure during voir dire. Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o2-o3.\nThe Court is bound to apply this demanding standard.\n\nThis high standard for an evidentiary hearing intentionally raises an “exacting hurdle” for\ndefendants because “motions to set aside a jury verdict are disfavored.” United States v.\nVentura, No. o9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4). As the\nSecond Circuit has repeatedly warned, “‘post-verdict inquiries may lead to evil consequences:\nsubjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening courts with meritless\napplications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; see also Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. lo7, ll9-2o (l987) (citing\nMcDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264, 267-68 (l9l5)). And an evidentiary hearing “is not held to\nafford a convicted defendant the opportunity ‘to conduct a fishing expedition.’” Stewart, 433\nF.3d at 3o6 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234).\n\nThe Defendant argues that the considerations in 7anner and Janniello are inapplicable to\nher motion because those cases “involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l53o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021531.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelol of 2l7\nSA-355\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 7 of 2l\n\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the questionnaire, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

Trial Tr. at 3o66; see also U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d\n8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\n\nLast, the Defendant argues—in a single sentence of her reply brief—that if Rule 6o6 does\nbar <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of Juror 5o’s statements about the second juror, then the rule “violates Ms.\nMaxwell’s constitutional rights to due process and to confrontation as applied to her.” Maxwell\nReply at 23. The Court rejects this argument. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amend. VI.\nThe Defendant’s right to confrontation is not implicated here because Juror 5o is not a “witness[]\nagainst” the Defendant but was instead a factfinder in her trial. Simply put, Juror 5o’s testimony\nat the hearing will be proffered to determine whether Juror 5o has engaged in any misconduct\nwarranting a new trial, not to accuse the Defendant of any crime. Cf Crawford v. Washington,\n54l U.S. 36, 43 (2oo4) (describing the Confrontation Clause as a “right to confront one’s\naccusers” (emphasis added)). Even if the Confrontation Clause were implicated, Rule 6o6’s\nprohibition on juror affidavits to impeach a verdict is a reasonable limitation, subject to other\nexceptions not at issue here, on the evidence that a defendant may muster, a limitation with a\nlong historical pedigree. See Pena-Rodriguez, l37 S. Ct. at 863 (tracing Rule 6o6 to traditional\nEnglish common law); Crawford, 54l U.S. at 54 (explaining that the Confrontation Clause “is\nmost naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admiting only\nthose exceptions established at the time of the founding”).\n\nNext, the Defendant’s due-process claim is squarely foreclosed by controlling precedent.\nThe Supreme Court in 7anner v. United States rejected a constitutional challenge to Rule 6o6,\nexplaining that a criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury is “protected by several aspects\nof the trial process,” including questions asked in voir dire; observations in court made by the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021539.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 363 3536o39, Pagelo9 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l5 of 2l\njudge, court personnel, and counsel; observations by other jurors, who “may report inappropriate\njuror behavior to the court before they render a verdict”; and “impeach[ment] [of] the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct.” 483 U.S. at l27; see also Warger, 574 U.S. at 5l (“[A]\nparty’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite Rule 6o6(b)’s removal of one means\nof ensuring that jurors are unbiased.”). The Defendant cites in support the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, but that case is unavailing to her position. There, the\nSupreme Court held that “where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on\nracial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that\nthe no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of\nthe juror’s statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.” l37 S. Ct. at 869.\nThroughout the opinion, the Supreme Court took great care to hold that the “unique historical,\nconstitutional, and institutional concerns” intrinsic to a juror with racial animus do not atach to\nother forms of juror misconduct. /d. at 868. In fact, it expressly contrasted the case of a juror\nwith racial animus to a juror that “ha[s] a personal experience that improperly influences her\n<span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> of the case,” as was at issue in Warger v. Shauers and as is alleged here. /d. at\n869.\n\nThird, even if the Court did consider Juror 5o’s statements about what another juror said\nduring deliberations—which Rule 6o6 prohibits—the statements proffered by the Defendant do\nnot meet the threshold of “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnonspeculative impropriety has occurred.” Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. According to an article in\nthe Daily Mail, Juror 5o “revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual\nabuse.” That sentence summarizes an unsworn and non-specific statement, which does not\nidentify the alleged misconduct or the juror in question with any particularity. It therefore falls\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021540.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 364 3536o39, Pagello of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l6 of 2l\n\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.

Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022016.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document26 Filed o2/lo/2o Pagel3 of l5 l3\nkllu2NoeC kjc\nl problem zealously representing my client, and I will do so.

In other words, the defendant must shou that\nhe has been “singled out” as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon,\n7l8 F.2d at l229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must shou that the\nGovernment’s discriminatory “selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in\nbad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to\nprevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” /d.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for\ncommiting the crime that Thomas commited does not mean that the Government harbored\ndiscriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®\n\n8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has\nfailed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective\nprosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather\nthan the jury.” Regan, lo3 F.3d at lo82. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of\nimproper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to\nthe criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge\nfor reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-\nevidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

Of note, our core value of\naccountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,\nourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,\nand the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is commited to\nproviding a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.\nRecommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate\nfollouing suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the\nparticular individual or security considerations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in\ncustody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.\nOur practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved\nand overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP\nhas updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation.

As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023485.jpg": "Appendix B: OIG Analysis of the BOP’s Response\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided a draft of this report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP), and the BOP’s response is incorporated as Appendix A.

Cellmate Assignments:\nInmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department\nhead meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,\nWarden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s\natorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making\nrecommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.\nPsychology Services takes into <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares\ntheir knouledge with Executive Staff.\nThe psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.\nEpstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. Houever, that is not correct. MCC New\nYork Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,\nincluding but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.\nPrior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology\nstaff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narroued the list doun to the most appropriate candidates.\nthe other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be\nhoused with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? \"© ]was deemed\ndangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narroued the\npossibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-o54, was placed in SHU for claims\nhe was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.\nBased on the above, <span class=\"highlight\">consideration</span> was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate\nin SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York\nExecutive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators\nwho are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.\n4.

Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of\nthe inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”\nThe Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with\na history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\nidentification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates\nentering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this.

The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records.
