See Hung v.

That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001360.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/oo8BG+ANNt B6euMesnt 2962 Filed/o4/o6/PagPage 22a 6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation. As a result,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool36o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001461.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 73, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC.

There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody.

The sheer volume of media reporting\nmentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in\nliterally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media\natention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In\nNovember 2ol9, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £lo,ooo bounty for information\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read:\n“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £lo,ooo reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal\nGhislaine Maxwell.”'° And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media\nreports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid\nquestioning by the FBI.'’ She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in\nthe bushes.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\n<span class=\"highlight\">television</span> and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national <span class=\"highlight\">television</span> with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\nDOJ-OGR-ooool859", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 34 of 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\n<span class=\"highlight\">television</span>. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by technical difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 26\nresolved the allegations against himself and any potential co-conspirator. Faced with significant\npublic pressure, the government broke that agreement and brought an indictment against Epstein,\nand only Epstein, in 2ol6. The charges were ultimately dismissed because Epstein died while in\nfederal custody. Left with no fish to atempt to fry, the government, belatedly, turned to Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nIt is inexcusable that decades have passed while the government investigated Epstein,\nresolved the allegations against him by plea and non-prosecution agreements, and then changed\ncourse when these agreements were atacked by plaintiffs’ lawyers who fueled the media fenzy.\nThis dithering has alloued memories to be corrupted, conflated, and confabulated.

Ms. Maxwell has separately moved to dismiss Counts\nOne through Four of the Indictment because those counts were brought after the expiration of the\napplicable statute of limitation, l8 U.S.C.A. § 3282, which provides, in relevant part, that “no\nperson shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment\nis found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been\ncommited.” The government will argue that a much longer statute of limitation applies to the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl96- Filed o4/o6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell.

The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable <span class=\"highlight\">television</span> stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page5ofl7\nIndividual voir dire is appropriate and within the court’s discretion in cases like this\nwhere the potential jury pool has been exposed to extensive pretrial publicity and may harbor\nprejudice against the defendant, and where the allegations touch on issues that are potentially\ninflammatory. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror questionnaire, is necessary in\nthis case (l) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire\nwill respond honestly to questions, and (i) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the\nvenire when other members disclose prior knouledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a\nprejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:\nIt may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire prospective\njurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the\nlikelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to\nquestions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased\nmembers of the venire when other members disclose prior\nknouledge of prejudicial information.\nNebraska Press Ass’n v.

A Tsunami of Pretrial Publicity About this Case\nCountless articles, books, podcasts, <span class=\"highlight\">television</span> shous, and docuseries from various\n\nsources have been published and broadcast concerning this case since it was filed in July 2o2o.\nThis folloued closely on the heels of an avalanche of media reports preceding and follouing\n\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 and follouing his death in August 2ol9. A tsunami of reporting in\nevery conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, radio, video streaming\n\nservices, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and\n\nglobally.

In the past, coupling voir dire with prospective jurors swearing an oath to tell\nthe truth was a pouerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once\ndid. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation\n\non the part of a witness was borroued from the British common law, the swearing of an\n\noath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would\n\ntell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be\n\nsubject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the\n\nwitness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed doun by God to\n\nMoses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 2o,\n\nVerse l6 (King James Version)). Unfortunately, the sanctity of the oath taken by\n\nwitnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laced with skepticism in recent years.\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 74o F.

Except for programs that she\ncompleted but could never put to use in isolation, she was not permited to participate in general\nprogramming (educational, leisure and wellness), to view movies, or to receive job assignment.\nWhen she first arrived in the MDC, she was handcuffed while seated in a chair watching <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>.\nDuring the first three months of detention, she was only alloued two l5-minute phone calls per\nmonth, further limiting contact with her family, most especially with her husband and stepchildren.\nThis is the same restriction that was applied in MCC’s lo South, the super-secure\nspecial/segregated housing unit (“SHU”) for inmates charged with terrorism offenses. A further\nchill was placed on her phone use when recordings of her calls were improperly released by the\nMDC to a third party. To forestall further disruption of the privacy of her family, she curtailed\nsocial use of the phone, further limiting contact with the outside.\n\nMs. Maxwell was denied adequate nutrition. She was provided meager, stale, often rancid\nand inedible meals in violation of her non-flesh diet and in packaging that melted when heated in\na microuave. At times she was not provided food for prolonged periods or was given meals\nmissing components. She was denied access to basic hygiene items, e.g., soap, toothbrush,\ntoothpaste, and provided only a limited amount of toilet paper. For more than a year, she brushed\nher teeth with an inch-long finger implement until given a normal toothbrush, that was never\nreplaced. Her commissary list was restricted, and she was not permited to order items available\nto other inmates.'> When the tap water in her isolation cell was foul-smelling and undrinkable,\nrequests for botled water were initially rejected by the prison administration. As a result of being\nprovided an inadequate diet, Ms. Maxwell has lost about 2o pounds and suffered from telogen\n'S Even in general population, her commissary is more restricted than other inmates.

In the day room, the defendant\nhad exclusive access to a telephone, a <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, and a\nshouer. The defendant had access to recreation time and programming, as well as multiple hours\neach day to meet with her atorneys. Those conditions are a far cry from the 23-hour-per-day\nlockdoun experienced by inmates in SAMs, and indeed, a far cry from many inmates in general\npopulation during the COVID-l9 pandemic, who were often locked in their cells for significant\nperiods of time to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe defendant baselessly claims that her conditions of detention “thwart[ed] her ability to\nparticipate in and prepare her defense.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 25). The Court was actively involved in\nensuring that the defendant’s conditions of confinement did not interfere with the ability to review\nher discovery materials and confer with her counsel in order to prepare for trial. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys. Maxwell also had as much, if not more, time as any\nother MDC inmate to communicate with her atorneys. She received five hours of VTC calls with\nher counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney VTC calls per week, and she had\naccess to in-person visits with her atorneys.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page5lof55\nbetween the defendant’s prior life and the life of an inmate may feel extreme to the defendant, but\nwhen compared to the experiences of other pretrial detainees in this District, her experience is by\nno means so shocking as to merit a dounward variance.\n\nIf anything, the defendant’s privilege remained intact while at the MDC, as demonstrated\nby the exceptional benefits she received. No other inmate received the kind of access to discovery\nand to counsel that the defendant did. The defendant had her oun shouer, her oun <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, her\noun desktop computer, her oun laptop, and her oun space to spend the day outside of her cell.\nThe defendant was able to get any concerns, no mater hou small, immediately brought to the\natention of MDC legal counsel through her atorneys. Comparing that treatment to SAMS is out\nof touch with reality. In many respects, the defendant’s conditions of confinement were\npreferential and more beneficial than those experienced by other inmates.\n\nTellingly, the defendant’s complaints about the MDC seem internally inconsistent. On the\none hand, she complains that she was removed from general population. On the other hand, she\nclaims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion\nof her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general\npopulation.

On the one hand, she complains that a camera was always on her. On the other hand, she\n° The defendant also makes the sensational claim that she was the target of a “credible death\nthreat.” (Dkt.

The Government has conferred with legal counsel for the MDC and\nhas been informed that the MDC conducted an internal investigation of the purported threat and\ndetermined the follouing: an inmate at the MDC remarked to someone in passing, in sum and\nsubstance, “Id kill her if someone paid me a million dollars.”” Someone else overheard that remark\nand reported it, resulting in the inmate being moved out of the housing unit.

None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on <span class=\"highlight\">television</span> and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015738.jpg": "PRE-ARRIVAL INFORMATION GATHERING\nThis is all the information necessary to mect the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their\nguests.

The sheer volume of media reporting\nmentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein’s arrest, she has been mentioned in\nliterally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media\natention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In\nNovember 2ol9, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £lo,ooo bounty for information\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read:\n“WANTED: The Sun is offering a £lo,ooo reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal\nGhislaine Maxwell.”!° And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media\nreports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid\nquestioning by the FBI.'! She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in\nthe bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o, her counsel has been flooded\nwith hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public.\n\nThe “open season” declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein’s death has come with an\neven darker cost — she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and\nhas had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only\nintensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends.

See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o264", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020277.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNit Di euitren2l9@2 lFited 547o6/249 Pagel 2 af 6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\nrecreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation. As a result,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020379.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC.

There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a <span class=\"highlight\">television</span>, anda shouer.

Hundreds of girls\nwere not only harassed but molested.” Nou The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $l million wire\ntransfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2oo4, just as he was seting up MC2.

Many of\n7 the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epsiein’s cash,\n| intimidation, and charm. Those who were l6 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 2os by the time\n| they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording te an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors knoun as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Atorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers.\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n7 of l8 commits @ felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\nno defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under l6, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn't hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatedly noted that the age of consent is louer in many other states.\nBut that dcesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forge the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl's atitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statufory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many pouerful friends and\natorneys. A highly intelligent man whe once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelors\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philantirapy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $3o\nmillion to Harvard University.\nMoreover, many of his high-pouered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes shoued that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered ta give\nevidence was heating up. Alberio Gonzales, who was U.S. atorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\nInstead, said atorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein commited crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he walks through his door a free man.\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 5oo companies and has produced\nfhree current events debate <span class=\"highlight\">television</span> programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut fo Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
