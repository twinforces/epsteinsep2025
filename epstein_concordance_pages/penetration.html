These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in Commonwealth v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital <span class=\"highlight\">penetration</span> as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting Commonwealth v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital <span class=\"highlight\">penetration</span>\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 45\n—_.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], <span class=\"highlight\">penetration</span> (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

There\nare currently many drugs that are used by sexual assault perpetrators to\nincapacitate victims (Horvath & Broun, 2oo5). These drugs may include\nRohypnol (e.g., “roofies”) and amphetamines, muscle relaxants, alcohol, or\nantihistamines. Other drugs, such as gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and\nketamine have also been indicated in drug-assisted sexual assault cases (see\nHorvath & Broun, 2oo5; Hindmarch & Brinkmann, l999). In a forensic case,\nit is important to determine whether the accuser voluntarily or involuntarily\nconsumed drugs. If the drugs were not voluntarily consumed, it is likely that\nthe individual who drugged the claimant had premeditated plans to control\nthe claimant (Welner, 2ool), regardless of whether the perpetrator assaulted\nthe claimant.\n\nThough consent issues are clearly important considerations when\ndetermining the nature of sexual behaviors while intoxicated, they are super-\nfluous considerations in this pathway. Under most state laws, a person\ncannot legally consent to sexual activity while intoxicated (Davis & Loftus,\n2oo8). In fact, even if consent to engage in sexual activity is ex ante (before\nthe first dose of the intoxicating substance), the act of engaging in sex-\nual activity while intoxicated can later be determined to be non-consensual\nsexual activity and is often sufficient evidence to convict someone of rape.\nTherefore, issues of consent, for these reasons, will not be discussed in the\ncontext of this pathway.\n\nA key issue in this pathway is whether the claimant believes that he\nor she was sexually assaulted while under the influence of intoxicating sub-\nstances, when in reality no sexual activity took place or activity occurred very\ndifferent from what she is nou claiming (e.g., she claimed <span class=\"highlight\">penetration</span> when\nno <span class=\"highlight\">penetration</span> occurred). Some drugs, when consumed at sufficient levels,\nmay cause impairments in information processing—sensation, perception,\nstorage, or retrieval. Substances knoun to cause these effects are alco-\nhol, sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, soporifics), and anxiolytics\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). High doses of alcohol have been\nshoun to inhibit memory in humans and animals (Bisby, Leitz, Morgan, &\nCurran, 2olo; Crego et al., 2oo9; Spineta et al., 2oo8). Moreover, upon ceas-\ning to use these drugs, withdrawal symptoms may include delirium and\npsychotic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; Lin, Heacock, &\nFogel, in press)—two additional pathways to false allegations that will be\ndiscussed later in this paper.\n\nThe information-processing errors of the intoxicating substances men-\ntioned above may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while\na person was intoxicated.
