Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe governmentâs recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDCâs request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourtâs concern regarding Ms. Maxwellâs opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The governmentâs leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the governmentâs leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwellâs conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDCâs assessment that âthe searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.â Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001331.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.â (/d. at ll).\nE. Judge Nathanâs Oversight of Maxwellâs Conditions of\n\nConfinement\n\n26. Asshe indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored\nMaxwellâs conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to\nsubmit regular updates regarding that topic (see Govât Ex. A (compiling update\nleters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide\nMaxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id.\nat lo-ll). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwellâs extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (âVTCâ) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendantâs arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that dayâs VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next dayâs VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDCâs leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Courtâs\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term â[iJn her current assignment,â the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwellâs treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with âa number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,â the MDCâs leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe governmentâs recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDCâs request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourtâs concern regarding Ms. Maxwellâs opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The governmentâs leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the governmentâs leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwellâs conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDCâs assessment that âthe searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.â Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl96- Filed o4/o6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendantâs isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (âVTCâ) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendantâs arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that dayâs VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next dayâs VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendantâs VTC calls with her atorneys.

She reported that she often\nrefuses to go to <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical\nhealth because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra\nblanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from\nher after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not\nprovided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she\nwas provided with small, inadequate portions or roten food. She has reportedly lost at least\nl5 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss. She reported that currently,\nshe suffers from constant headaches and back pain.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subject to flashlights being shined on the ceiling of her cell in l5-minute\nintervals every night since she has been incarcerated. A leter authored by U.S. Atorney\nAudrey Strauss states, â... MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because\nthe defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule...because\nMDC has identified a number of factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns\nwith respect to this detendant.â! Ms. Maxwell reported that these flashlight checks have\nsignificantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time the guards\nshine the flashlight into her cell. When she was brought from the detention facility to court,\nshe was awoken at 3am, transported, and held in a cold cell for hours prior to her scheduled\ncourt appearatice.\n\nUpon my initial meeting with Ms. Maxwell in October 2o2o, she did not manitest\npsychiatric symptoms of any kind.

(See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. She\nwas permited to review her discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. During her\npretrial confinement, Maxwell had access to both a desktop computer provided by the MDC and\na laptop computer provided by the Government in November 2o2o on which to review discovery.\nAlso during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant had access to the MDC desktop computer\nto send and receive emails with her atorneys.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe governmentâs recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDCâs request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourtâs concern regarding Ms. Maxwellâs opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The governmentâs leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the governmentâs leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwellâs conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDCâs assessment that âthe searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.â Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020248.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.â (/d. at ll).\nE.

While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (âVTCâ) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendantâs arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that dayâs VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next dayâs VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendantâs VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC.

All inmate mail is sent to the MDCâs mail room, where every piece of mail is processed\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls.\n\nLike any other inmate, the defendant is pated doun by MDC staff whenever she is moved\nto a different part of the facility. Typically, these searches include at least two pat-doun searches\nof the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each\nmorning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night. In addition,\nwhen the defendant elects to atend outdoor <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>, she is searched two additional times: once\nwhen she is moved to the <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> area, and once when she returns to the day room from the\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> area.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epsteinâs pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epsteinâs compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are âlocked dounâ in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epsteinâs period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important.

Figure 6.5 depicts one such noose, which is illustrative of the types of linens found in\nEpsteinâs cell; the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\n48 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related\ninformation and provides unit officers an electronic event log.\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23444", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024539.jpg": "Date: o8/l9/2ol9\nTime: lo-32.

He stated he does not want to be housed in the SHU because he is not comfortable\nthere; he wants to be single-celled if he goes to the SHU; he wants Colace, not the Ducolex he received from medical\nyesterday; he wants to be able to walk around and go to <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>; he does not want to wear an orange uniform to his\nlegal visits because he is treated âlike a punished inmate;\" he wants a phone call before he leaves the psychological\nobservation area; he wants a shouer and touel; he would like to be housed in the cadre (5S) unit; and would like his\nproperty, paper, and a pen.\nInmate Epstein's concerns were addressed by this writer and it was explained to him he will not be single-celled or\nplaced in a housing unit for safety and security concerns. His medical concerns (constipation) were discussed with\nhealth services as well as his desire to be placed on Colace. Inmate Epstein was provided a shouer this morning.\nIntervention(s)\nInmate Epstein was provided with supportive intervention and coping skills strategies today. He was receptive to\ninterventions and was able to elucidate his various needs. He did not present with any acute psychopathology and\ncontinues to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He is looking forward to his bail hearing on Monday but\nstated he is aware that even if he gets bail, it will take at least two weeks to sort things out so he can leave the jail.\nProgress/Plan\nInmate Epstein is not in any psychological distress, does not present with any mental health symptoms or complaints,\nand is denying any suicidality. He appears psychologically stable at this time and can be released from the\npsychological observation area. Inmate Epstein will be housed in the 9S area with a cellmate. He will be seen again\ntomorrou by psychology to evaluate his mental status and psychological stability.\nCompleted by PhD /Chiet Psychologist on o7/lo/2ol9 o9:o9\nGenerated o7/lo/2ol9 o9:o9 by PI) |PhDIChiet Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page l of l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026350.jpg": "Page 2694\nre U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nSPECIAL HOUSING UNIT RECORD FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\nRW YORKM CE ae\n(Institution)\n763l8-o54\nOe |: ne\nInmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg.

The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epsteinâs\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epsteinâs photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epsteinâs pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epsteinâs compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the courtâs order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epsteinâs death.\nI. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are âlocked dounâ in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epsteinâs period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epsteinâs daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

The Chief Psychologistâs\nassessment was that Epstein had âprotectiveâ factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide.

The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologistâs notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmateâs\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmateâs\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was geting along with his cellmate. According to her\nreport, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of\n\n47\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l4"};
