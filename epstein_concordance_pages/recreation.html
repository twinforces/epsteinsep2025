Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001331.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\nE. Judge Nathan’s Oversight of Maxwell’s Conditions of\n\nConfinement\n\n26. Asshe indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to\nsubmit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A (compiling update\nleters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide\nMaxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id.\nat lo-ll). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls.

Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nAs counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we write in response to the leter from Sophia\nPapapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff atorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The leter fails to address a\nnumber of concerns raised in our October 29\" leter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised with\nthe Court. The MDC’s leter also contains inaccuracies and omissions and raises more questions\nthan it atempts to answer. Rather than paraphrase our leter, we are providing it for the Court’s\nconsideration. (See Exhibit A.) We renew our request that Warden Tellez respond directly to\nthe Court and counsel and explain why Ms. Maxwell must be detained under such harsh and\nrestrictive conditions.\n\nUsing the term “[iJn her current assignment,” the leter atempts to present a picture of\ncompliance with total disregard of the deficiencies of Ms. Maxwell’s treatment up to this point.\nWhile her meals may currently be in accordance with BOP policy, until September they were\nnot. While her weight may currently be fairly consistent, she had lost over l5 pounds, and she is\nsustaining hair loss. It took approximately six weeks follouing arrival to the MDC for Ms.\nMaxwell to be permited personal calls on par with other inmates; previously she was given two\ncalls per month unless authorized by the warden. While generally permited to be out of her\nisolation cell and confined to the day room from 7:oo am to 8:oo pm with one hour of <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>\ntime, general population inmates are permited to be out of their cells until 9:3o pm and given\nmore extensive <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time. While flashlight checks may be performed during regular\nrounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to such checks every l5 minutes. Further, because Ms. Maxwell\nis kept in isolation, she in not permited to participate in activities accorded inmates in general\npopulation, such as programming (educational, leisure and wellness), movies, religious services,\njob assignment.\n\nTouting that Ms. Maxwell is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested\npositive for COVID-l9,” the MDC’s leter totally ignores that she was in contact with a member\nof her revolving security team who tested positive, necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be\nquarantined for l4 days. This further diminished her ability to prepare her defense and resulted in\ncancelled legal visits.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2729", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl96- Filed o4/o6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\n\ntakes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC.

(See, e.g., Dkt.\nNos. 49, 92, ll6, l3l, 265, 268, 282). Indeed, the Court repeatedly found that the defendant has\nhad sufficient time to confer with defense counsel and review her discovery. (See, e.g., Dkt. Nos.\n49, lo6). As the Government has repeatedly informed the Court throughout the pendency of this\ncase, Maxwell received more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\n2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s recent leter regarding MDC conditions (Dkt.l58) essentially repeats\nthe same points it made in defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing\nthe MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to use a laptop on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the\nCourt’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity to review discovery and the extent to\nwhich she is required to undergo searches. The government’s leter, houever, does not include\nthe concerns defense counsel has reported to MDC Legal during the past couple of months. In\naddition, the leter incorrectly states that legal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by\ncounsel have been denied.\n\nBy ignoring the myriad other issues reported by counsel, the government’s leter\nmisrepresents Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. Ms. Maxwell does not have access to\ndaily discovery review for the entirety of the l3 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving her\nthe 5o feet or so from the isolation cell to the day room are a large part of the challenge.\n\nThe number of searches is also not correct. Ms. Maxwell is searched on every move,\nincluding to the empty concrete space, adjacent to the day room, used for <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>. Currently,\nshe is subject to a minimum of four pat doun searches a day if she goes to rec, and five pat doun\nsearches on the day of her weekly body scan. Since July 6\", Ms. Maxwell has been physically\nsearched approximately l4oo times, including pat doun searches, metal wand searches, mouth,\nhair and ear searches (posing additional health risks during COVID), and upwards of 6o body\nscans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation cell, locker,\nlegal papers, and personal effects. No contraband has ever been found.\n\nWe take issue with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety\nof the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under 24-hour surveillance by two to six\nguards and approximately l8 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on her\nthroughout the areas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell poses no danger to\nanyone. Her restrictive conditions, searches, and constant surveillance correlate directly to BOP\nnegligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020248.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Pagel4 of 25\nwhile her proposed bail package is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable\nassurances.” (/d. at ll).\nE.

The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2o2l,\nnoting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and\ncommunications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>; the thirteen\nhours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with\nexclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shouer; and her\naccess to medical care, including the COVID-l9 vaccine, which she has nou\nreceived.

Accordingly, the\ndefendant is permited out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the\ndefendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on\nwhich to place social or atorney calls, and a shouer. The defendant is also permited outdoor\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> every day, although she has the option of declining such <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> time if she wishes.\n\nThe defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to\ncommunicate with her atorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-\nteleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of atorney\nVTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdouns or short\nstaffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 3o minutes. When\nsuch delay occurs, houever, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either\nby extending that day’s VTC call or by permiting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC\ncall. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC\nstaff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a\ncamera approximately 3o feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the\nVTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view\neither the defendant or her atorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does\nnot capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her atorneys. In other words, the\ncamera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC\nroom. The defendant is also permited to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her\natorneys as needed.\n\nIn addition, defense counsel nou have the option of meeting with the defendant in person\nat the MDC. On or about February l6, 2o2l, the MDC resumed in-person visitation.

The MDC has placed HEPA air\nfilters in its atorney visiting rooms to improve air quality during visits. Additionally, the\ndefendant has received the COVID-l9 vaccine and is nou fully vaccinated. The Government\nunderstands that defense counsel have thus far declined to meet with the defendant in person and\ninstead rely on VTC calls, email, and supplemental phone calls to communicate with their client.\nThe option of in-person visits remains available seven days per week should defense counsel wish\nto meet with the defendant in person.\n\nThe defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at\nthe MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed\nbefore being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the\nvolume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,\nhouever, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has\nregular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls.\n\nLike any other inmate, the defendant is pated doun by MDC staff whenever she is moved\nto a different part of the facility. Typically, these searches include at least two pat-doun searches\nof the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each\nmorning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night. In addition,\nwhen the defendant elects to atend outdoor <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span>, she is searched two additional times: once\nwhen she is moved to the <span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> area, and once when she returns to the day room from the\n<span class=\"highlight\">recreation</span> area.

Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York.

The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nI. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or\ndisciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day.

The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.
