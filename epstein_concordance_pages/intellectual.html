THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney.

Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment.

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Disability: <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9of4l\n\ne “Dissociation”: “[I]t is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with\nevents that for them feasibly could have occurred.” (/d. at lo).\n\ne “<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability”: “Intellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals\nwithout ID, have vulnerabilities related to memory and communication that the legal\nsystem may not be equipped to handle adequately.” (/d.).\n\nAs set forth belou, the Government objects that these opinions invade the province of the jury, are\nwithin the ken of the jury, are unhelpful and prejudicial, are unreliable, and lack fit to any issue to\nbe tried in this case.\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several opinions generally related to the evaluation of witness\n\ncredibility:\n\ne “Changes in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices\nin determining the credibility of a victim’s claims.” (Ex.

This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Disability: <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3of 29\nJournal of Forensic Psychology Practice, l2:97-l23, 2ol2\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC a ROUE age\nISSN: l522-8932 print/l522-9o92 online\nDOT: lo.lo8o/l5228932.2ol2.65oo7l\nAREA REVIEWS\nPathways to False Allegations\nof Sexual Assault\nJESSICA ENGLE, BA\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\nWILLIAM O’DONOHUE, PhD\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true.

Without clear physical evidence, the\ndecisions of the legal system are based merely on the relative credibility of\nthe narratives of the persons involved. In addition, physical evidence can be\nambiguous: Medical evidence may allou a determination of whether inter-\ncourse occurred, and perhaps whether the intercourse was “rough,” but not\nwhether that sexual contact was consensual.

Thus, it is possible that in the\nevent of a sexual assault, dissociation may cause a person to fill in the parts\nof the experience that are not clearly remembered with events that for them\nfeasibly could have occurred.

Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acqui-\nsition of social, occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. ID\nhas several etiologies that often are related to biological or pathological\nprocesses affecting the central nervous system. Many of the specific vulner-\nabilities that arise from ID overlap to some extent with other disorders (e.g.,\nautism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and thus,\nin many cases, individuals with other developmental disabilities may also\nhave ID.\n\nRates of sexual assault are higher in intellectually disabled populations\nthan populations without ID (Mitra, Mouradian, & Diamond, 2oll). It is\nhypothesized that the true rate of sexual assault among individuals with\nID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2oo3). There are many rea-\nsons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual\namount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.\nDifficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by\nindividuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual assault\n(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2ool). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as\ncaregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,\n2oo3). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual\nassault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,\nJoyce (2oo3) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-\ntant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get\ninto trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it\ncan be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual\nassault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6289", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

(p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Disability: <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l7 of 375\n\nPi Mu Epsilon, National Mathematics Honorary, elected l965\n\nMortar Board, National Senior Women’s Honorary, elected l965\n\nElected, Golden Key International Honour Society, honorary member, 2oo5\n\nFellouships\n\nOffice of Education Traineeship, Stanford University, l966-69\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health Fellouship, Stanford University, l969-7o\n\nAmerican Council on Education Fellouship in Academic Administration, Harvard University, l975-76\n\nFellou, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, l978-79\n\nGrants, Contracts, Research Funding\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l97l-72; l972-73; l976-79 (Human Memory)\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, l974-76 (Human Memory)\n\nGeneral Services Administration, l974-75 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Bureau of Standards, l976-77; l98o-82 (Communications--w/Keating)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l978-85 (Human Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l98o-83 (Jury Behavior--w/Severance)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l983-85; (Hypnosis--w/Greene)\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, l984-86; l986-89;l989-92 (Memory)\n\nNational Center for Health Services Research, l986-88 (Survey Memory)\n\nNational Science Foundation, l986-88; l988-9l (Jury Comprehension--w/Greene-Goodman)\n\nFund for Research on Dispute Resolution, l989-9l (Predictions of Success--w/Goodman)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l99l-95 (Cognition & Health--w/Croyle)\n\nNational Institute of Health, l993-94 (Health/sex memory: subcontract from UCSF/Catania)\n\nLeverhulme Trust, Postevent info and erasing memories, l997-l999 (w/ Dan Wright, Univ. of Bristol)\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh, Travel Grant, 2oo6\n\nGrawemeyer Award Funding given to UCI, 2oo5-present.\n\nNewkirk Center for Science & Society, 2ol7-2ol9.\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nNational Lecturer of Sigma Xi, l978-8o\n\nAmerican Psychological Association nomination for the NSF Waterman Award for Outstanding\nContributions to Science, l977 and l978\n\nNational Media Award for Eyewitness Testimony (American Psychological Foundation, Distinguished\nContribution, l98o)\n\nGreyhound Research Award, l987-88\n\nHonorary Fellou, British Psychological Society, l99l (includes lifetime membership)\n\nGeorge E.

At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o77", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Disability: <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagellofl7\ntestimony for a permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that jurors will instead use\nDr. Dietz’s testimony to evaluate the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and <span class=\"highlight\">intellectual</span> disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex.

The research in particular has looked at what types of\n\nll vulnerability factors place children at higher risk.

Can you explain the personal factors.\n\nl7 A. So we knou that children who have experienced victimization\nl8 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical\nl9 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for\n2o example, of being revictimized later. We knou that children\n2l who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health\n22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child\n23 sexual abuse.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n: Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.

THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\nA. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\n\nof Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department\nheaded by the United States Atorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce\nfederal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal\nleadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful\nbehavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces\nfederal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal\nstatutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the\nDepartment had approximately llo,ooo employees in 4o components. The Department’s\nheadquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations\naround the nation and overseas.\n\nThe prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Atorney’s\nOffices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)\nU.S. Atorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Atorney\nGeneral through the Deputy Atorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by\nan Assistant Atorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also\nprosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Atorney’s Offices, and provide legal\nexpertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this\nReport are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section\n(CEOS).\n\nCEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises atorneys and investigators who specialize\nin investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,\nand they assist U.S. Atorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these\noffenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,\nand government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution\npolicies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2ol8 and renamed the Justice Manual)\nis a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department\nemployees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division\n! Two U.S. Atorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are\nheaded by a single U.S. Atorney. The Atorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting\nand interim U.S. Atorneys.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o39", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and <span class=\"highlight\">Intellectual</span> Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.
