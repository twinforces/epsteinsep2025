Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (l984), reprinted in l984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3l82, 3l89. And that’s true no mater hou much rhetoric and hyperbole the\ngovernment and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,\ncompelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations\nof conduct from l4 to l7 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l4l et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges\nwho travel and oun property abroad.\n\nThe government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government\nmay have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over l8; some\nunder; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s\nresidence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet l8.! But their\nanticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred\nwithin a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible\ndespite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.\nEpstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved\nanybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that l8\nU.S.C. § l59l aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,\nbut it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —\nand at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.\n\nMr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred\nin Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City\nmunicipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing\nmore than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knous no other languages. He\nouns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he\nmaintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.\n\nUntil his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the\n2oo7 NPA (Exhibit l) and a 2oo8 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct\nsubstantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 3o-month sentence, l8 months of incarceration, and l2\nmonths’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served l3 months\nin custody, l2 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was\nrequired to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered\n' New York’s age of consent was l7 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.\n\nSee N.Y.

For one thing, Epstein has potent legal defenses to prosecution under l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the sex trafficking statute driving the pending indictment. We front and briefly\noutline one of those defenses for the limited purpose of seeking bail. We will amplify it later,\nalong with various other arguments, in full-bloun dismissal motions.\n\nSection l59l was passed as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2ooo\n(“TVPA”), Pub. L. No. lo6-386, ll4 Stat. l464 (October 28, 2ooo). In enacting the TVPA,\nCongress recognized that human trafficking, particularly of women and children in the sex\nindustry, “is a modern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery today.” 22\nU.S.C. § 7lol(b)(l); see also id. at § 7lol(b)(2), (4). “The TVPA criminalizes and atempts to\nprevent slavery, involuntary servitude, and human trafficking for commercial gain.” United\nStates v. Evans, 476 F.3d ll76, ll79 (llth Cir. 2oo7). Importantly, “the entire language and\ndesign of the statute as a whole indicates that it is meant to punish those who are the providers or\npimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.” Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll-CV8573, 2ol2 WL\nl3o4263o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll-CR-4ool6,\n2ol2 WL l37o4, at *4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2)) (emphasis added). In Fierro, the district court\nfound § l59l inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of sex acts. Here, the principal conduct\nunderlying the indictment is Mr. Epstein’s payment of money for massages that purportedly\nescalated to alleged sex acts. Mr. Epstein’s conduct, houever, is akin to consumer or purchaser\nbehavior and should be outside the ambit of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. See Fierro, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o,\nat *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers of sex from trafficking\nvictims...”).!°\n‘o While Fiero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein notes that there is a division of\nauthority on the scope of § l59l. See United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66, lo68 (8th Cir.\n2ol3). The defense respectfully submits that the Fiero court’s approach to this issue is more\npersuasive and more consistent with the Congressional purpose to target commercial sex\ntrafficking.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000331.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 3of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y.

Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\nencounter.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or intentional violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.'

Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl Filed o6/29/2o Page 4ofl8\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein in front of a minor victim.

The indictment alleges\n24 that the defendant participated in some of these acts of abuse\n25 herself, including sexualized massages in which the victims\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool9ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l3 of 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l34 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 23\n\nThe district court granted the motion.

The questions contained argumentative, loaded words and\nphrases that Giuffre’s lawyers refused to define or clarify and asked Ms. Maxwell to speculate\nabout Epstein’s intent and state of mind. The vast majority of the questions had nothing to do\nwith the actual truth or falsity of the claims of Giuffre that Ms. Maxwell pointed out as “obvious\nlies.” Counsel for Ms. Maxwell was required to object to hundreds of questions that suffered\nfrom a myriad of form and/or foundational infirmities. Ms. Maxwell, when siting for these\ndepositions, knew she had done nothing wrong and was unaware that Giuffre’s lawyers were\nencouraging the Government to initiate a criminal investigation.* And had, no motive to lie in\nresponse, particularly given that Epstein had long ago served a prison sentence in Florida arising\nout of the same conduct that was the subject of the defamation action.\n\nAlthough a few lines of that first deposition testimony are quoted in the Indictment, the\nGovernment improperly redacted objections to the questions and omited important preceding\nand follouing pages of testimony. The omited portions of the transcript include numerous\nobjections and requests for clarification regarding terms that the Government selectively quotes\nin the Indictment, such as “scheme,” “recruit,” and “sexual <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.” The two answers that the\nGovernment claims were knouingly and materially false statements were “I don’t knou what\n\n+ Stephen Rex Broun, “Manhatan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell case in 2ol6: sources,” New York Daily News (Oct. l3, 2o2o)\n(htps://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-2o2olol3-\njmzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6ebfnszu-story.html) (detailing David Boies’ purported efforts to urge the SDNY US\nAtorney’s Office to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in February 2ol6, shortly before her first deposition, and\nagain after her second deposition, arguing in apparent violation of the protective order that she had\ncommited perjury during her “confidential” depositions).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo24l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 27\n\nIn mid-2ol6 after this second deposition, according to media reports, Giuffre’s lawyers\nurged the Government to charge Ms. Maxwell with perjury based on her testimony.” It is\nunclear hou the atorneys could have done so without violating the protective order, which\nforbade them from sharing the contents of these “confidential” depositions with law\nenforcement.\n\nII.

Post-Indictment Proceedings in the Civil Case\n\nAs the Court is already well-aware based on prior litigation, Judge Preska currently is\n\noverseeing both the remand unsealing proceedings in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case as well as the\nGiuffre v. Dershouitz mater. Last week, Judge Preska issued a ruling in connection with the\nrequest from Ms. Giuffre and the Miami Herald to unseal the second Maxwell deposition from\nJuly 2ol6. As is pertinent here, Judge Preska ruled:\n\n“During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked repeatedly about her oun sexual\n\nactivity with consenting adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n\ndeposition, she provided testimony in response to those questions. . . . This\n\ntestimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nallegations that were central to the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.”\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo242l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 27\nCir. l978) (deciding prosecutor's question whether accused “handled” checks too ambiguous;\naccused could justifiably infer “handled” meant “touched”).\n\nMoreover, “a perjury conviction must rest on the uterance by the accused of a false\nstatement; it may not stand on a particular interpretation that a questioner places upon an\nanswer.” Id. at 374 (citing Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 36o). “[A]ny special problems arising from the\nliterally true but unresponsive answer are to be remedied through the ‘questioner's acuity’ and\nnot by a federal perjury prosecution.” Bronston, 4o9 U.S. at 362. “The burden is on the\nquestioner to pin the witness doun to the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.” /d. at 36o.\n\nB. Count Five\n\nl. First question: “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage\ngirls for sexual massages? If you knou.”\n\nThis was an improper question for many reasons and was, accordingly, the subject of\nwell-founded objections. The question asked for Ms. Maxwell to understand and comment on\nEpstein’s state of mind; any answer would either have been made without personal knouledge\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 6o2 or have been hearsay.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s answer—‘“I don’t knou what you are talking about” — was completely\nunderstandable, particularly given the context. At the time of the deposition, Epstein had pled\nguilty to a state indictment in Florida, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the Palm\nBeach Police department investigation were widely knoun and discussed in the deposition. Ms.\nMaxwell’s answer, “I don’t knou what you are talking about,” was simply a true statement that\nthe question lacked clarity.\n\nThe Government has selectively, and misleadingly, omited testimony and objections to\nquestions that place Ms. Maxwell’s statement in context. The complete exchange:\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 22 of 27\nee\nAccording to Wiktionary, we are still in the 2ooos: “2ooos (Noun) The millennium that began\non January l, 2ooo and ends on December 3l, 2999.” Also as defined in: Dictionary:\n2ooos may refer to:\n\ne 2ooos (decade), the period from 2ooo to 2oo9\n\ne The period from 2ooo to 2o99, almost synonymous with the 2lst\ncentury (2ool-2loo)\n\ne The period from 2ooo to 2999, almost synonymous with the 3rd\nmillennium (2ool-3ooo)\n\n(Accessed December l8, 2o2o). The question posed, with the ambiguous date range was\ninclusive, meaning the answer would cover the entire period, not a part of that period.

Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nThe Second Circuit in Lighte reversed a perjury conviction on a finding that\n“fundamentally ambiguous” questions that gave rise to allegedly perjurious answers and should\nnever have been submited to the jury.” Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 375-77. “When a line of\nquestioning is so vague as to be ‘fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers associated with the\nquestions posed may be insufficient as a mater of law to support the perjury conviction.” Jd. at\n375 (quoting United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o)).\n\nHere, the questions that elicited both of the allegedly perjurious statements in Count\nFive—“Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you\nknou.” and “List all the people under the age of l8 that you interacted with at any of Jeffrey’s\nproperties?” —were fundamentally ambiguous. So were the follouing questions in Count Six,\nwhich preceded each of the allegedly perjurious statements regarding sex toys and three-way\nsexual encounters:\n\ne Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in sexual activities in\n\nMr. Epstein’s Palm Beach house?\n\ne Do you knou whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual\nactivities?\n\ne Other than yourself and the blond and brunete that you have identified as having\nbeen involved in three-way sexual activities, with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual\nactivities?\n\ne Is it your testimony that in the l99os and 2ooos, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein\nwas having sexual activities with anyone other than yourself and the blond and\nbrunete on those few occasions when they were involved with you?\n\ne Two questions about an undefined type of “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.”\n\nThis Court can and should dismiss Count 5 and Count 6 as a mater of law.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2432\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002434.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl36 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 25 of 27\n(D.D.C. 2oll) (granting pretrial motion to dismiss indictment based on insufficient evidence\nwhere the only relevant evidence was internet chat transcript).\n\nB. Counts 5 and 6 Should Be Dismissed\n\nNone of the questions that elicited the allegedly perjurious testimony were material to the\nproceeding in which the testimony was given. As Judge Preska ruled, the questions were “far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell.” Ex. l at 7. Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that Giuffre’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\nirrelevant to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have influenced any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required Giuffre to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and Professor Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. Ata July 3l,\n2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled\nguilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration, registered as a\nsexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary\ndamages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with\nEpstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

Ms. Maxwell is not alleged, houever, to have enticed or otherwise caused either\nAccuser-2 or Accuser-3 to travel.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 allegedly took place entirely in London,\nEngland, where Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have “groomed and befriended” Accuser-3 “between\napproximately l994 and l995.” Jd. § 7c. Ms. Maxwell allegedly introduced Accuser-3 to\nEpstein and arranged for “multiple interactions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein,” during which\nMs. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage\nin sex acts with [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd.\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3 during the\nmassages (id.), it does not allege that Epstein’s interactions with Accuser-3 were nonconsensual\nor in violation of any English law.

The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in interstate or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996).

There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated interstate or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\nirrelevant to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of 23\nhave commited the offenses alleged.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nRule l7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nI write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) with respect to Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell’s motion for an order authorizing a subpoena on BSF pursuant to Rule l7(c)(3)\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”) and the Court’s March l2, 2o2l,\nSealed and Ex Parte Order requiring BSF to file a leter indicating (l) whether service on BSF can\nbe deemed adequate notice on victims whose personal or confidential information the Subpoena\nis aimed at obtaining and (2) whether the victims object to or seek modification of the Subpoena.\n\nFirst, BSF does not object to service on BSF constituting adequate notice on any victims it\nrepresents. The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transportation of (and conspiracy to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2877\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l44 of 239\ntrial record—that the questions were fundamentally ambiguous, and the defendant’s answers were\ntruthful and immaterial.

This case does not present the narrou circumstances in which a court can and should dismiss\nperjury counts, let alone do so before trial.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, follouing the USAO-SDFL entering into the non-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein, two minors filed a petition under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l, alleging that the prosecutors violated their rights under that statute. See Doe v. United\nStates, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D.F.L). See generally Doe No. l. v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, loo2\n(llth Cir. 2ol4) (describing the background of the suit). On December 3o, 2ol4, Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre moved to join the petition, alleging that the USAO-SDFL had also violated her CVRA\nrights. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 279.*° In her motion for joinder, Giuffre described\nthe defendant as “‘one of the main women’ Epstein used to ‘procure under-aged girls for sexual\nactivities,’” and as a “‘primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme. See Giuffre v. Maxwell,\nNo. l8-2868 (2d Cir. 2ol9), Dkt. No. 287 at lo (containing the unsealed summary judgment\nopinion from l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP)). Among other allegations, Giuffre alleged that the defendant\n“““nersuaded’ [her] to go to Epstein’s mansion,” and, “when Giuffre began giving Epstein a\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, [he] and [the defendant] ‘turned it into a sexual encounter.’” /d. at ll. Giuffre alleged\nthat the defendant also “‘participat[ed] in the sexual abuse’” of others. Jd. A few days later, the\npress reported a statement by a spokesman for the defendant, Ross Gou. Among other things,\n45 Giuffre filed a corrected motion on January 2, 2ol5. See Doe, No. o8 Civ. 8o736, Dkt. No. 28o.\nThe court later struck the original motion, sealed the corrected motion, and ordered filing of a\nredacted version of the corrected motion. See id., Dkt. No. 325 (Apr. 7, 2ol5).\n\nll7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l45 of 239\nGou stated that Giuffre’s claims were “untrue” and “obvious lies.” (l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.\nNo. | at 6).\n\nAs described in the preceding section, in the fall of 2ol5, Giuffre sued the defendant for\ndefamation.*° (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l). Giuffre alleged that Epstein sexually abused\nher, “with the assistance and participation of Maxwell” at “numerous locations” between l999 and\n2oo2, and that Epstein abused more than thirty minors between 2ool and 2oo7 “with the assistance\nof numerous co-conspirators.” (/d. at 3).\n\nDuring the defendant’s first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the defendant refused to answer\nquestions that she deemed related to consensual adult sexual interactions. (See, e.g., Ex. lo at\n92:2o-93:6). Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l at 5-\n6). Giuffre also explained that the defendant’s refusal to answer questions about adult consensual\nsex prevented Giuffre “from seeking legitimate discovery,” such as the identity of people the\ndefendant presently deemed adults. (/d. at 6).\n\nThe Court granted Giuffre’s motion. “[N]otwithstanding” the intrusiveness of the\nquestions and the fact that the defendant had not put her private affairs at issue, “the questions are\ndirected to reveal relevant answers regarding Defendant’s knouledge of Plaintiff’s allegations.”\n© The belou discussion is provided as context for the Court’s consideration of the motion. As\ndiscussed further in the Government’s opposition to the defendant’s motion for severance, the\nGovernment expects to provide a more streamlined presentation regarding the Giuffre suit at trial.\n\nll8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l46 of 239\n(Def. Mot. 4, Ex. H at 9). “That knouledge,” the Court explained, “goes directly to the truth or\nfalsity of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiffs claim.” (/d.). The Court therefore\nordered the defendant to answer the questions related to her sexual activity with or involving (l)\nEpstein, (2) Giuffre, (3) underage girls knoun to Epstein or who she thought might become knoun\nto Epstein, or (4) involving <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> with individuals the defendant “knew to be, or believed might\nbe, knoun to Epstein.” (/d. at lo). The Court further ordered the defendant to answer questions\nabout her knouledge of the sexual activities of others in the same four categories. The Court added\nthat the “scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by time period, though Defendant need not\nanswer questions that relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant.” (/d.). The\ndefendant sat for a second deposition on July 22, 2ol6, before the case setled.\n\nAs discussed more fully belou, the Indictment charges the defendant with two counts of\nperjury, one arising from statements made during the April 2ol6 deposition and one arising from\nstatements made during the July 2ol6 deposition. Indictment 9 2l, 23. (Ex. lo at 253:25-254:8,\n384:l5-2o; Ex. ll at 88:9-89:l3, 9l:22-92:l6, ll3:2-l2). The defendant nou moves to dismiss\nboth counts, arguing that the Court can effectively decide nou, as a mater of law, that the questions\nwere fundamentally ambiguous, her answers were true, and her answers were immaterial to the\ncase.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nSection l623(a) imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any proceeding before or\nancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.” l8 U.S.C. § l623(a).\nIn perjury prosecutions, “whether the witness believes that an answer is true or false generally\nturns on the declarant’s understanding of the question.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372\n(2d Cir. l986). Accordingly, and as is true of virtually all factual issues, “[a] jury is best equipped\n\nll9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 239\njury.”). At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about hou Giuffre\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The transcript makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2). Giuffre’s counsel then asked questions\nabout whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from\n\nl23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003085.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 239\ndefense counsel and which the defendant ultimately answered by saying “I cannot tell you what\nJeffrey’s story is.

(Def. Mot. 4 at 9-lo, l8). A properly instructed jury could\nreadily conclude otherwise in light of the evidence the Government expects to introduce at trial.\nThe defamation case involved allegations that Giuffre was a victim of that scheme: Giuffre had\nalleged that Epstein and the defendant had sexualized a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> that Giuffre gave Epstein. The\npreceding questions focused on (l) whether the defendant brought underage masseuses to work\nfor Epstein, and (2) whether Epstein had a sexual preference for underage girls. Moreover, at trial\nand as discussed further belou, the Government expects to elicit testimony from one or more of\n‘8 Underlined sentences are charged as false statements in the Indictment.\n\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003086.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l52 of 239\n\nthe victims specified in the Indictment about sexualized massages the victims provided to Epstein,\nconduct that obviously predated the deposition. See Indictment { 7(a), (c). In context, and with an\nunderstanding of the Government’s other evidence, a rational juror could readily conclude that the\nquestion “did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages . . . [i]f\nyou knou?” had a clear meaning, and more important for purposes of the instant motion, any\nambiguity was not “fundamental.” Cf Triumph Capital Grp., Inc., 237 F. App’x at 628\n(concluding that an answer about “this arrangement” was not fundamentally ambiguous).\n\nNor is there any basis to dismiss the count nou based on the defendant’s professed\nconfusion or denial of knouledge of the scheme’s existence. A defendant may commit perjury by\nfalsely denying memory or knouledge of an event. See, e.g., United States v. Alberti, 568 F.2d\n6l7, 625 (2d Cir. l977); United States v. Weiner, 479 F.2d 923, 926, 929 (2d Cir. l973); Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d at 4lo-ll. Viewing the question and answer “in the context of the line of\nquestioning as a whole,” the defendant “consistently denied” knouledge of Epstein’s scheme,\nMarkiewicz, 978 F.2d at 8lo, and a jury could conclude that the “question was not fundamentally\nambiguous—and thus that [the defendant], understanding the question, lied.” See Sampson, 898\nF.3d at 3o7; cf Indictment 4§ 4(e) ll(c)-(d), l7(c)-(d) (discussing use of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> as part of the\nsexual abuse scheme).\n\nSecond, later in the deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions\nin an atempt to identify other underage girls that the defendant met and brought to Epstein.\nSpecifically:\n\nQ. Can you list for me all the girls that you have met and brought to\nJeffrey Epstein’s house that were under the age of l8?\nMR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the form and foundation.\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003094.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6o of 239\nThe defendant, therefore, argues that the questioner asked whether a logically impossible\nevent occurred or will occur at some point over the course of a millennium. But the defendant’s\nprofessed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain\nand obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human\nlife span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex\nwith Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when\nshe answered it in July 2ol6, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the\nquestions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she nou assigns to those questions: whether,\nduring the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself\nhaving sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to shou that she was.\nSee, e.g., Indictment § l (stating that the defendant “assisted, facilitated, and contributed to”\nEpstein’s sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant’s answers were not “literally true\nunder any conceivable interpretation of the questions.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the\ndefendant’s professed confusion nou and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant\nmotion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at l22l (“A\ndefense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving\nit in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is\nconsidered as a whole.”). Accordingly, a jury should be permited to determine what meaning the\ndefendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false.\nFinally, the defendant answered the follouing questions:\n\nQ. Did you ever give a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at\n\nany of Mr. Epstein's properties?\n\nA. First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\n\nl33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l6l of 239\nQ. I will ask that question if you want, but I was focusing on people\nother than Mr. Epstein right nou.\n\nA. I don’t give massages.\nQ. Let's just tie that doun. It is your testimony that you’ve never\ngiven anybody a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>?\nA. Lhave not given anyone a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nQ. You never gave Mr. Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, is that your testimony?\nA. That is my testimony.\nQ. You never gave [Minor Victim-2] a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> is your testimony?\nA. Inever gave [Minor Victim-2] a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\n\n(Ex. ll at ll2:l7-ll3:l2).\n\nThe defendant argues that these questions were fundamentally ambiguous because the\ndeposition elsewhere discussed both sexual and professional massages. It was unclear, she\nexplains, what kind of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at l7.) The defendant’s\nargument is, yet again, misguided. This line of questioning used broad language, and at no point\nduring this set of questions did Giuffre’s counsel suggest that the questions were limited to sexual\nor professional massages. Cf Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word “you” was\nambiguous when the prior two questions asked about the defendant “as an individual” and then\nswitched “without indication” to the defendant “as trustee”). The defendant’s answers were\nunequivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Cf Markiewicz, 978\nF.2d at 8o9 (explaining that a question was ambiguous as to whether it asked about the deponent’s\npersonal or professional capacities, in light of the deponent’s confusion in the next questions). A\nproperly instructed jury could conclude that the defendant meant what she said: she never gave\nanyone a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, including Epstein and Minor Victim-2.\n\nl34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 239\nstatements at the heart of that case and the evidence that might have been uncovered had the\ndefendant answered the questions truthfully. A jury should be alloued to hear the questions in\ncontext to evaluate their materiality, which cannot be done at this stage.*! The Court therefore\nshould deny the motion.\n\nIn any event, the perjurious statements were material in both senses of the definition. First,\nthe questions were aimed at developing a record in the civil suit that Epstein and the defendant\nrecruited Giuffre to Epstein’s Palm Beach property in the guise of hiring her as a masseuse, and\nthen sexualized that <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Honest answers to those questions—for instance that Epstein in fact\nhad a scheme to recruit underaged girls for sexual massages—would have been corroborative of\nsome of Giuffre’s claims. Second, had the defendant honestly answered the deposition questions,\nGiuffre could have located other victims or witnesses who may have corroborated her testimony.\nBut in any event, the question of materiality should be put to the jury and is inappropriate for the\nCourt to resolve on a motion to dismiss without the benefit of the full factual record. The motion\nshould be denied.\nallegations that were central to the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 4, Ex. I at 7:3-6.)\n(The last colloquy has been unsealed except for Minor Victim-2’s name. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP),\nDkt. No. l2l2-l).) Yet Judge Preska’s opinion as to the propriety of certain redactions in a civil\ncase is not controlling as to whether the Government can meet the elements of a criminal perjury\ncharge here. First, before Judge Preska were the defendant’s denials of various sexual activities,\nnot honest answers that would have been quite different. In part for that reason, Judge Sweet\nauthorized the deposition at the outset. Second, the Government was not a party to the civil\nunsealing litigation and did not have an opportunity to be heard on this issue before Judge Preska.\n>! While the Government is open to crafting a stipulation on the background of the Giuffre lawsuit\nto streamline presentation of these issues to the jury, it notes that the defendant’s summary of that\nsuit as set forth in her motion is incorrect. (£.g., Def. Mot. 4 at 2o (erroneously asserting that the\ndefamation claims at issue turned on Giuffre’s ability to prove salacious allegations about public\nofficials)).\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003102.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 239\noften will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice and permit joinder.” Page, 657 F.3d at l29 (internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe perjury counts should be tried jointly with Counts One through Four. The offenses are\nof similar character, are logically connected and will be proved through much of the same evidence\nbecause the perjury counts concern at least some of the same conduct relevant to the crimes\ncharged in Counts One through Four and, as such, are properly joined. See generally Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Severing the counts would waste judicial resources by requiring a second trial at\nwhich the Government would offer similar proof, including by calling the same victims of sexual\nabuse to testify again at a second trial. The defendant has identified no prejudice sufficient to\njustify imposing that burden on the victims, the Court, and the Government.\n\nFirst, the Government expects to prove the offenses charged in Counts One through Four\nand those charged in Counts Five and Six with much of the same evidence. See United States v.\nHester, No. l9 Cr. 324 (NSR), 2o2o WL 34837o2, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2o2o) (““Notably, the\nfact that evidence of the crime charged in one count may be admissible in the Government’s direct\ncase in the trial of the other will typically defeat the need to severe the counts.”). At trial, some of\nthe most critical evidence that the defendant commited the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four will also form the crux of the Government’s proof of the falsity of the defendant’s\ndeposition testimony. In particular, victim testimony and related evidence offered to prove the\nexistence of Epstein’s scheme to abuse underage girls, and Maxwell’s participation therein, will\nalso provide much of the evidence demonstrating the falsity of the statements charged in Count\nFive. Compare, e.g., Indictment § 4(c), (e) (discussing massages resulting in sexual abuse), with\nid. J 2l (denying interacting with underage girls and a denying a “scheme to recruit underage girls\nfor sexual massages”). Similarly, aspects of that proof, such as testimony regarding the sexualized\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l69 of 239\nmassages that were part of the scheme, will also prove the falsity of the statements charged in\nCount Six. Indeed, were severance to be granted, the facts involving Counts One through Four\n“would be central to a separate trial” on Counts Five and Six. Butler, 2oo4 WL 227475l, at *4;\nsee Sweig, 44l F.2d at ll8-l9 (“Virtually every overt act alleged in the conspiracy count formed\nthe subject mater of one of the eight perjury counts, and would therefore be admissible in a perjury\ntrial to shou the falsity of Sweig’s denial before the grand jury.”).\n\nCritically, the Government expects that proof to include testimony from victims of sexual\nabuse. For instance, the Government anticipates that Minor Victim-2 will testify that the defendant\ngave her an unsolicited <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> during which Minor Victim-2 was topless. Indictment § 7(b).\nThat is an overt act charged in Counts One and Three. /d. 4¥ ll(c), l7(c). Itis also strong evidence\nthat the defendant’s statement “I never gave [Minor Victim-2] a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” was false, as charged\nin Count Six. /d. 423. If the Court severs the Indictment into two trials, it will require Minor\nVictim-2 to testify about her abuse twice. Cf Richardson v. Marsh, 48l U.S. 2oo, 2lo (l987)\n(recognizing that joint trials of multiple defendants avoid “requiring victims and witnesses to\nrepeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying”).\n\nSimilarly, the defendant’s efforts to conceal her crimes by lying in a deposition is itself\ncompelling evidence of her consciousness of guilt as to the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four and indeed would almost certainly be relevant and admissible at a trial as to those\ncounts even if severance were granted. In particular, and among other examples, the defendant’s\nfalse denial of the existence of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages, and her\nspecific (and equally false) denials as to Minor Victim-2, would be admissible as evidence of the\ndefendant’s consciousness of guilt, even at a trial focused exclusively on Counts One through Four.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 747 F.3d 5l, 6o (2d Cir. 2ol4) (“[A]cts that exhibit a\n\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7l of 239\ntherein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in bankruptcy court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\nGiuffre’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim identified as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to Giuffre. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on Giuffre. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto Giuffre or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong connection between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller.

Counts One\nand Three allege that the defendant participated in conspiracies with Epstein both to transport\nminor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.\nIndictment Jf 9-ll, l5-l7. In the course and as part of those conspiracies, the defendant groomed\nmultiple minor victims for sexual abuse by Epstein through multiple methods, including\nbefriending victims and encouraging minor victims to provide massages to Epstein knouing he\nwould engage in sex acts with them. /d. 94 l, 4,7, l4. As detailed in the Indictment, that grooming\nwas a fundamental part of both conspiracies because it encouraged minor victims to be alone with\nand to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Jd. JJ l, 4, l4. It follous that the defendant’s role grooming\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein was a part of and therefore constitutes evidence\nof these conspiracies. /d. | 7(c), ll(d), l7(d).\n\nThe defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege that each element of\nsubstantive violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her\nexperiences cannot be direct evidence of the conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in\nCounts One and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It is\naxiomatic that a conspiracy does not require a completed substantive crime. See Salinas v. United\nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997) (“It is elementary that a conspiracy may exist and be punished\nwhether or not the substantive crime ensures, for the conspiracy is a distinct evil, dangerous to the\n\nl6l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 239\n4o4(b)(2); (i) is relevant to the crime for which the defendant is on trial; (ll) has probative value\nthat is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudicial effect; and (iv) is admited with a\nlimiting instruction to the jury, if requested. See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 68l, 69l-\n92 (l988); United States v. LaFlam, 369 F.3d l53, l56 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nHere, evidence regarding the defendant’s interactions with Minor Victim-3 is admissible\nto prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi, all of which are permissible\npurposes under Rule 4o4(b). Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003179.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3 of 348\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\ninvestigated allegations that in 2oo7-2oo8, prosecutors in the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nSouthern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal\nconduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement\n(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. During the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003289.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company.

OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*°!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*° Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”>*\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.°°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*7® Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion <span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span>,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

The courts holding is equally applicable here:\n\nPrecise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury\n\nconviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers\n\nso long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is\n\nthe lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth\n\nwith the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as\n\nto be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed\n\nmay be insufficient as a mater of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).\nAnd, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 58o F. Supp. 2d 925, 93l (N.D.\nCal. 2oo8), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury\nprosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The\ngovernment argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like\nsteroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the\nqualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.\n\nThe government, at page l33 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on\nMs. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite\ntime span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear\nquestions and to “pin doun” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 23l, 236-37. It is the\ngovernment, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms\n“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or\nEpstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing\nwhen she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.” (Count Six). Because the\nquestions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the\nquestioner meant.\n\nThe answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally\ntrue.” Bronsion v.

In fact, it became knoun to the government that\nMaxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane\nDoe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein’s\nmansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators\ncoerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doe #3\nbegan giving Epstein a “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as\nthey had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and\nwith the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”\nEpstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about l999 through 2oo2, when she managed to\nescape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From\nl999 through 2oo2, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm\nBeach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on\nhis Epstein’s private planes, and elsewhere.\n\nEpstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to\npolitically-connected and financially-pouerful people. Epstein’s purposes in “lending” Jane Doe\n(along with other young girls) to such pouerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for\n\n3\nGIUFFRE oo429o\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 28o Entered on FLSD Docket ol/o2/2ol5 Page 7 of l4\nand other pouerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being\nconcluded in the secretive manner in which it was.\nJane Doe #4’s Circumstances\n\nIf permited to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that\nshe has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2, based on the\nfollouing:\n\nAs with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein. In\nor around the summer of 2oo2, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-\nold child, was told by another one of Epstein’s underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could\nmake $3oo cash by giving an old man a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. During that call, Epstein himself got on the\nphone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to\nhis mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nJane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large\nbathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal\njet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.\n\n7\nGIUFFRE oo4294\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page5ofl7\n\nCounts 5 and 6, “the Perjury Counts,” are improperly joined with Counts l-4, the “Mann\nAct Counts.” For the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, the Court\nshould sever the Perjury Counts and grant a separate trial on these charges.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9ofl7\n\nC. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper\n\nThe government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the\nPerjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act\nCounts. Resp. l4l-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in\none instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.\nResp. at l44. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the\ngovernment uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to\nprove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not sufficient reason, by itself, to\ntry the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the\ninterests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some\noverlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).\n\nIncredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions\ninstead of asserting the privilege against self-incrimination is somehou admissible in the trial of\nthe Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at l4l-42. For example, the government\nrepeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The\nactual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you knou .. .” and her answer was “I don’t\nknou what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not\nby demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did knou what the examiner was talking about, but instead\nthat a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And\nthe answer of not understanding the questioner shous “consciousness of guilt.” This is a circular\nargument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch. For an allegedly false exculpatory\nstatement to be of any value “it either must involve a mater collateral to the facts establishing\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl4\n\nEven more incomprehensible is the government’s argument that the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are not prejudicial. The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in interstate and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3.

Indeed, even\nafter interviewing Accuser-4, the USAO-SDFL never found “any specific evidence against” Ms.\nMaxwell related to the subject of their investigation and thus determined she was not a target of\nthe Florida Investigation.”\n\nEpstein, himself, was never charged with federal crimes in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation; ee. Instead, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) in order to “resolve globally” his oun criminal exposure and to immunize and\nany other “potential co-conspirators.” As part of the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to\nstate prostitution offenses and register as a federal sex offender. He also agreed, in a novel\narrangement, to pay for atorneys to represent his victims in civil lawsuits against him and to\nwaive his right to contest damages up to an agreed-upon setlement amount.

(Ex. A, OPR\nReport at i-i).\n\nThe similarity of the allegations presented to the SDFL grand jury and those alleged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment is striking and self-evident. The same overt acts,\nincluding the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in\nCounts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries. Furthermore, the proof offered to\ncorroborate Accuser-4’s allegations—e.g., cell phone records, FedEx records, message pad\nnotes, etc_—was identical. (See Ex. C at 56:2l-57:lo).

A,\nOPR Report at l67 (internal quotations omited)).\n\nHence, it would not only be impermissible under the NPA to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for\nthe offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment because they were “the subject\nof” the Florida Investigation and “the related grand jury investigation.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 7). It would\nalso be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the\nsame accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben\nshe first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 27 of 32\ntime period from 2ool-2oo4. The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A Bill of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore necessary and appropriate. See Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575 (Bill of Particulars warranted where “[t]he relevance of key events was shrouded in\nmystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial”). /d. at 575.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already credibly asserted that her\nprosecution on Counts Five and Six is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a Bill of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

(Ud. J l3, l9).\n\nVII. The Court Should Order the Government to Produce Accuser-4’s Prior Statements\nas Brady Material.\n\nAs explained above, it is apparent from the non-testifying witness material, which the\ngovernment produced just a few weeks ago on April l3, 2o2l, that Accuser-4 has only recently\nincluded Ms. Maxwell in her allegations of sexual abuse. In her summary of Accuser-4’s\nallegations that she gave to the SDFL grand jury on March l8, 2oo8, Special Agen i\nmade no mention of Ms. Maxwell, indicating that Accuser-4 never discussed Ms. Maxwell when\nthe FBI interviewed her in connection with the Florida Investigation. Indeed, it is clear from the\ngrand jury testimony that Accuser-4 implicated a. not Ms. Maxwell. Only nou, l3\nyears after she first reported these events to the Palm Beach FBI and several months after Ms.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 29 of 32\nMaxwell had been indicted and publicly vilified in the press as Epstein’s primary accomplice,\ndid Accuser-4 suddenly allege for the very first time that Ms. Maxwell was involved in Epstein’s\nsexual abuse. Accuser-4 nou claims that Ms. Maxwell, among other things, “groomed” her to\nengage in sexualized massages with Epstein, encouraged her to recruit others to do the same, and\nwas present when Accuser-4 was nude in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room of the Palm Beach Residence. (S2\nIndictment § 9d). Had Ms. Maxwell, in fact, done the things that Accuser-4 nou accuses her of\ndoing, Accuser-4 certainly would have mentioned it to the FBI and those allegations would have\nbeen part of the SDFL grand jury presentation. Ms. Maxwell surely would have been named as a\nco-conspirator in the proposed 6o-count indictment like a That never happened. (See Ex.\nA, OPR Report at l67 (internal quotations omited)) (USAO-SDFL never found “any specific\nevidence against” Ms. Maxwell related to the subject of the investigation).\n\nAn informed witness who fails to mention the defendant when making a report to law\nenforcement is exculpatory under Brady. United States v. Torres, 7l9 F.2d 549, 555-56 (2d Cir.\nl983); Jones v. Jago, 575 F.2d ll64, ll68 (6th Cir. l978); Clemmons v. Delo, l24 F.3d 944, 952\n(8th Cir. l997); White v. Helling, l94 F.3d 937, 944 (8th Cir. l999). Accordingly, Accuser-4’s\nprior statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms.\nMaxwell, are exculpatory Brady material that the government must immediately produce to the\ndefense. As the Court ruled:\n\nThe Government must disclose to the defense all information ‘favorable to an\n\naccused’ that is ‘material either to guilt or to punishment’ and that is knoun to the\n\nGovernment. .. . The Government shall disclose such information to the defense\n\npromptly after its existence becomes knoun to the Government so that the defense\n\nmay make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.\n\n(Dkt. 68 at l) (emphasis added).\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4 of 349\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\ninvestigated allegations that in 2oo7-2oo8, prosecutors in the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nSouthern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal\nconduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement\n(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nl. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7. The\n! As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word “girls” refers to females who\nwere under the age of l8 at the time of the alleged conduct.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4o of 349\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. During the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4l of 349\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 46 of 349\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about . . . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get .. . a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 62 of 349\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll4 of 349\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “I enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender ....” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 235 of 349\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”*\"!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”*°? Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

See, e.g., S2 Indictment 4 9(d),\n25, 27. Further, the S2 Indictment provides extensive detail regarding hou the sex trafficking\nscheme operated. See, e.g., id. §§ 6-7. In particular, the S2 Indictment explains that the defendant\nor another of Epstein’s employees would: call a minor victim to schedule an appointment to\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein; greet the minor victim at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and escort her into a\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, where Epstein would then engage in sex acts with the victim; and pay the minor\nvictim hundreds of dollars in cash after the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. See id. 7. The S2 Indictment specifies the\ntypes of sex acts involved in this conduct, see id. { 7(b), and further identifies the particular role\nthat the defendant played in facilitating the trafficking of Minor Victim-4, see id. § 9(d). Among\nother things, the S2 Indictment describes conversations the defendant had with Minor Victim-4\nand further explains that the defendant called Minor Victim-4 to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments,\npaid Minor Victim-4 after completing massages, sent Minor Victim-4 gifts from New York to\nFlorida, and encouraged Minor Victim-4 to bring other young females to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein. See id.\n\nGiven all of these details, the S2 Indictment alone provides a sufficient basis to deny the\ndefendant’s motion in its entirety. See, e.g., United States v. Bonventre, 646 F. App’x 73, 79 (2d\nCir. 2ol6) (“‘[E]videntiary detail is not the function of the bill of particulars.’ Particulars are\nnecessary only where indictment charges are ‘so general that they do not advise the defendant of\nthe specific acts of which he is accused.’” (internal citation omited) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at\n234; United States v.

There is no need to depart from the customary rule in this district of\ndisclosure shortly before trial.”).\n\nAlthough not essential to the timing analysis here, the Government notes that the defense\nmotion overstates the significance of the particular statements Minor Victim-4 made during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation. The Government understands from its more recent interviews with\nMinor Victim-4, the notes of which the Government will produce to the defense as part of Minor\nVictim-4’s Giglio and Jencks Act material, that she was not asked any questions about the\ndefendant during her only interview in connection with the USAO-SDFL’s investigation, which\nfocused instead on Epstein and another of Epstein’s employees. Notably, though, when Minor\nVictim-4 was deposed in connection with a civil lawsuit after she was interviewed during the\nUSAO-SDFL’s investigation but more than a decade before the defendant was indicted in this\ncase, Minor Victim-4 affirmatively stated that the defendant was one of the individuals who\nscheduled her <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments with Epstein. Minor Victim-4 was not asked any follou-up\nquestions about the defendant during that deposition, but her prior consistent statement regarding\nthe defendant’s involvement in scheduling her massages severely undercuts the defense’s\nsuggestion that Minor Victim-4 entirely fabricated the defendant’s role in Epstein’s scheme after\nthe defendant was indicted in 2o2o.

Cosby asked hou she could play such a role\nwithout ever having had that experience. So, he gave her some wine. Thomas drank\nonly a litle of the wine before becoming extremely intoxicated.

Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the reliability of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error.

Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is\nentirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex\nacts took place.\n\nNevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3\nwas not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations\nverbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct\nalleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should\nnot admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as\n“other act” evidence under Rule 4o4(b).

Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence related to\nAccuser-3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe original indictment against Ms. Maxwell, filed on June 29, 2o2o, and the first\nsuperseding indictment, filed on July 8, 2o2o, included the follouing allegations related to\nAccuser-3:\n\nMAXWELL groomed and befriended [Accuser-3] in London,\nEngland between approximately l994 and l995, including during a\nperiod of time in which MAXWELL knew that [Accuser-3] was\nunder the age of l8. Among other things, MAXWELL discussed\n[Accuser-3’s] life and family with [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL\nintroduced [Accuser-3] to Epstein and arranged for multiple\ninteractions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein. During those\ninteractions, MAXWELL encouraged [Accuser-3] to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nEpstein, knouing that Epstein would engage in sex acts with\n[Accuser-3] during those massages. [Accuser-3] provided Epstein\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo567o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page/7of2l\n\nwith the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein\n\nsexually abused [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein\n\nengaged in sexual activity with [Accuser-3] on multiple occasions,\n\nincluding at times when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8,\n\nincluding in the context of a sexualized <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nSee Indictment (Dkt. ool) § 7(c); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) § 7(c). Both indictments\nalso alleged the follouing as an overt act of the charged conspiracies: “Between in or about l994\nand in or about l995, when [Accuser-3] was under the age of l8, MAXWELL encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” See Indictment (Dkt. ool) {fj ll(d),\nl7(d); Sl Superseding Indictment (Dkt. ol7) 44 ll(d), l7(d).\n\nMs. Maxwell filed a pretrial motion to strike the allegations related to Accuser-3 as\nsurplusage on the grounds that they could not support the charged conspiracies and were unfairly\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s\nPretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59 & n.56. The government atempted to defend its use of the\nphrase “sexual abuse” by asserting that the description was “factually accurate” because\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo567l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005675.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 387 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof2l\nIl. Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment ff ll-l2); and (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. 9] l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. J l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the conspiracy” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5675\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\ncharacter and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor irrelevant under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\nirrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3,\nAdvisory Commitee Notes, l972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks\ninducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is irrelevant\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo576l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6of9\nthe “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” See id. at l8l (quoting United\nStates v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer, J.)) (discussing propensity evidence).\n\nA rape allegation is also highly emotional and inflammatory, much more so than the\nactual conduct charged in this case (sexualized massages). “Evidence shall be excluded as\nunduly prejudicial when it is ‘more inflammatory than the charged crime.’” United States v.\nMidyet, 6o3 F. Supp. 2d 45o, 456 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (quoting United States v. Livoti, l96 F.3d\n322, 326 (2d Cir. l999)); cf! United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l33 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(affirming admission of evidence under Rule 4o3 when it was “no more inflammatory than the\ncharges alleged in the indictment”); United States v.

The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped Accuser-l. And Ms. Maxwell is not accused of conspiring to entice or transport minors\nacross state lines so Mr. Epstein could allegedly rape them. Again, the alleged conspiracy in this\ncase is limited to securing ““sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein. If jurors hear an allegation\nabout an alleged rape by Mr. Epstein, that evidence will confuse and mislead them, in addition to\nsuggesting that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis. See United\nStates v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act evidence in a\nconspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would confuse the issues,\ncause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 84\nee only highlights that this evidence does “not involve conduct any more\nsensational or disturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was charged,” which weighs\nin favor of admiting these exhibits under Rule 4o4(b)(2).

(ECF No. l87, §§ 6, 7(b)). The Government expects that Employee-l will\ntestify about Employee-l’s observations of the close relationship between the defendant and\nEpstein. Indeed, Employee-l will testify that Employee-l worked out of the defendant’s\ntounhouse in Manhatan during the weeks that Employee-l worked in New York City. The\nGovernment also expects Employee-l to testify about her observations at Epstein’s properties,\nincluding observations of minor girls at the properties, as well as her knouledge of Epstein’s\npractice to arrange multiple sexualized massages per day. In addition, although Employee-l’s\nemployment post-dates the defendant’s conduct with the victims in this case, Employee-l became\nfamiliar with certain items in Epstein’s residences during her tenure there, and thus Employee-l\nwill authenticate certain exhibits relating to the Minor Victims.

Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse.

In response, the\nGovernment explained that the defendant and Epstein’s “interactions with Minor Victim-3 were\npart of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor victims with the intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts,” and in any event, admissible under Rule 4o4(b) as evidence of the\ndefendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. (Gov’t Opp. at l57-l69, Dkt. No. 2o4). The\nGovernment expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met the defendant\nwhen she was a.

In its atempt\nto confuse the issues, the defense argues that the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3 was\nlawful in the United Kingdom, and that Minor Victim-3 was an adult when she ultimately traveled\nto the United States and was abused by Epstein. The defense states that “[a]s to [Minor Victim-\n3], the completed endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense.” (Def. Mot. 4 at 8 (emphasis in original)). The defense then claims—without any basis—\nthat the allegations relating to Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are “of no consequence,” because\n“the government evidently charged the conduct under the mistaken belief that [Minor Victim-3]\nwas a minor when she engaged in sex acts with Epstein.” (/d. at 9-lo). According to the defense,\nthe government “did not knou that [Minor Victim-3] was above the [age] of consent in the U.K.\nThe government presented [Minor Victim-3]’s allegations to the grand jury incorrectly assuming\nthat she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and [Minor Victim-3] were\nillegal.” (/d. at l-2).\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to initiate sexual contact with minor girls.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

The government has apparently abandoned efforts to introduce her\ntestimony as Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\nIn their response, the government still fails to comply with the new Rule 4o4(b) notice\nrequirements.

The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\nconspiracy.

Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb. Opinions About Hindsight Bias\n\nHindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or\n\n“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagel4 of 4l\n\nThat opinion is only one of those noticed by the defense, houever. The defense expert\nnotice includes four other sets of opinions that supposedly respond to Dr. Rocchio but do not\nsatisfy the Daubert standard. First, the expert notice—which closely parallels the defense’s\nDaubert motion—improperly discusses the facts of this particular case and comments on various\nlegal documents, even though it offers no basis whatsoever to conclude that Dr. Dietz has any legal\nexpertise or has reliably applied any expertise to the facts of this case. In particular, the notice\nstates that Dr. Dietz will opine that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on grooming “carries the risk of\nimputing motive and intent to the Defendant” (Ex.

These opinions, while potentially relevant to the Court’s consideration of a\nDaubert motion, are not properly put before a jury.\n\nSecond, certain of Dr. Dietz’s opinions about grooming are not themselves reliable or\ninvade the province of the jury. In particular, it is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive\nand intent,” because grooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. (Ex. A at 3). That is,\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming behaviors. If Dr.\nDietz’s point is that determining motive and intent is for the factfinder (id.), the Government\nagrees—and Dr. Dietz should not be permited to testify that grooming behaviors “impute[] motive\nand intent without adequate evidence.” (/d.) The adequacy of the evidence is a question for the\njury.

Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony.

The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment 44 ll-l2); and (ll) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id.

As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. 9§ l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58.

See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d.

Indeed, Employee-l will testify that Employee-l worked out of the defendant’s\ntounhouse in Manhatan during the weeks that Employee-l worked in New York City. The\nGovernment also expects Employee-l to testify about her observations at Epstein’s properties,\nincluding observations of minor girls at the properties, as well as her knouledge of Epstein’s\npractice to arrange multiple sexualized massages per day. In addition, although Employee-l’s\nemployment post-dates the defendant’s conduct with the victims in this case, Employee-l became\nfamiliar with certain items in Epstein’s residences during her tenure there, and thus Employee-l\nwill authenticate certain exhibits relating to the Minor Victims.

Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse.

Discussion\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is direct evidence of the charged criminal conduct—\nspecifically, the conspiracies in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. Minor Victim-3’s\nexpected testimony describes a patern in which the defendant and Epstein groom a young girl, ask\nher to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein, sexualize that <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, invite the girl to travel, and ask her to find other\ngirls for Epstein. The Government expects that Minor Victim-3’s testimony, which concerns a\nperiod of time overlapping with or in close proximity to other Minor Victims’ experiences with\nthe defendant and Epstein and concerns teenagers of similar ages, will significantly overlap with\nthe testimony of those other Minor Victims. Put simply, Minor Victim-3’s account is\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006756.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 48 of 84\nMaxwell’s state of mind.” (Op. & Order at 26-27, Dkt. No. 2o7 (“Courts in this district generally\ndelay ruling on any motion to strike until after the presentation of the Government’s evidence at\ntrial, because that evidence may affect hou specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’’)).\nHaving concluded that it should delay striking these overt acts until after presentation of the\nGovernment’s evidence, the Court should not nou effectively reverse its decision by precluding\nthat very evidence. If the Government’s proof at trial does not establish the relevance of Minor\nVictim-3’s testimony, if anything, the proper course is for the defense to move to strike the relevant\novert acts and Minor Victim-3’s testimony at that time.\n\nEven if evidence of Minor Victim-3 were uncharged criminal activity, it would still be\nnecessary to understand the other aspects of the charged conspiracies. Minor Victim-3\nexperienced the patern of abuse in close temporal proximity to the other Minor Victims: the\nconduct involving Minor Victim-l spans l994 to l997, the conduct involving Minor Victim-3\nspans l994 to l995, and the conduct involving Minor Victim-2 occurred in l996. The defendant’s\nacts touard Minor Victim-3 shou (l) the defendant’s relationship with Epstein, including her\nwillingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages, (2) the defendant’s knouledge of both\nthe sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims, and (3) her\nwillingness to transport minors to further their abuse. This evidence is therefore direct proof of\nthe defendant’s state of mind and agreement to participate in a conspiracy with Epstein. Moreover,\nher relationship with Minor Victim-3 was “part of [her] continued effort” to commit the offenses\ncharged in Counts One and Three. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d at 44; see United States v.

In its atempt\nto confuse the issues, the defense argues that the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3 was\nlawful in the United Kingdom, and that Minor Victim-3 was an adult when she ultimately traveled\nto the United States and was abused by Epstein. The defense states that “[a]s to [Minor Victim-\n3], the completed endeavor—i.e., her alleged sex acts with Epstein—was not a substantive criminal\noffense.” (Def. Mot. 4 at 8 (emphasis in original)). The defense then claims—without any basis—\nthat the allegations relating to Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are “of no consequence,” because\n“the government evidently charged the conduct under the mistaken belief that [Minor Victim-3]\nwas a minor when she engaged in sex acts with Epstein.” (/d. at 9-lo). According to the defense,\nthe government “did not knou that [Minor Victim-3] was above the [age] of consent in the U.K.\nThe government presented [Minor Victim-3]’s allegations to the grand jury incorrectly assuming\nthat she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and [Minor Victim-3] were\nillegal.” (/d. at l-2).\n\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6758\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5l of 84\n\nNot so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 84\nand knew that Epstein used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to initiate sexual contact with minor girls.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

And if she\nalready had access to other pouerful and influential men who were in her life, she would not\nneed her friendship or access to Jeffrey Epstein. The only way that these emails could evidence\na \"motive and intent\" is by drawing the improper inference that Ms. Maxwell has a propensity to\n\"facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like.\" This is exactly the\ntype of evidence forbidden by Rule 4o4(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 66o F.2d 23, 4o-4l\n(2d Cir. l98l) (\"While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the\npurposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 4o4(b) barred its use to\nprove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...\").\n\nEven if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice, the Emails’\nabsence of relevance to the charged conspiracy, and the government's failure to set forth a non-\npropensity ground for admissibility, the Emails should also be excluded under Rules 4ol and\n4o3, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the\nissues.

The\nfirst is an argument for admission of this evidence under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of\nthe conspiracy. The second simply begs the question and assumes that the government can\ncircumvent Rule 4o4(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks\nthe numerous precedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are\nseparate and distinct from the charged offenses are not admissible as direct evidence of a\nconspiracy. And the fourth completely misstates the law. These arguments should be rejected.\n\nFirst, the government argues that I evidence is admissible as direct\nevidence of the charged conspiracies because it is relevant to shou the “patern” of abuse—\nincluding “grooming” the accusers, encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and asking\nthem to recruit others—and her “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies. (/d. at 45-46).\nBut “patern” is just another word for “modus operandi,” which along with “intent” are bases for\nadmission under Rule 4o4(b), not as direct evidence of the conspiracies. See Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b) (“other act” evidence may be admissible to prove “motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident) (emphasis\nadded); United States v. Walia, No. l4-CR-2l3 (MKB), 2ol4 WL 3734522, at *l3 (S.D.N.Y.\nJul. 25, 2ol4) (Rule 4o4(b) permits “other act” evidence to be admited to prove “modus\noperandi’).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added).

Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. As we previously argued in our initial Motion, rape is highly\nemotional and inflammatory, much more so than the “sexualized massages” alleged in the S2\nIndictment. See Mot. at 2-3. Admiting testimony of an alleged rape would pose a serious risk\nthat the “jury will convict for crimes other than those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will\nconvict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9\nU.S. l72, l8l (l997) (quoting United States v. Moccia, 68l F.2d 6l, 63 (lst Cir. l982) (Breyer,\nJ.)) (discussing propensity evidence). Such evidence would also confuse the issues at trial and\nmislead the jury. It will cause the jurors to focus on conduct that is not relevant to the charged\noffense and suggests that they convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper and highly emotional basis.\nSee United States v. Stein, 52l F. Supp. 2d 266, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (excluding other-act\nevidence in a conspiracy case under Rule 4o3 because of the “risk that this evidence would\nconfuse the issues, cause undue delay, and be used for an improper purpose”). The Court should\ntherefore preclude any testimony or evidence about an alleged rape.\n\nXI. REFERENCE TO ACCUSERS AS \"VICTIMS\" IS IMPROPER VOUCHING\nWithout explaining its logic, and by way of cases concerning jury instructions, the\ngovernment disagrees that use of the term \"victim\" by witnesses and the prosecution during trial\n\namounts to improper vouching. Yet, the government offers that the only times it expects the\nword will be used at trial are (a) by the prosecutors during their jury addresses, and (b) in Dr.\nRocchio's testimony concerning her patients.

First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide background information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and substance, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a conspiracy to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\nconspiracy, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking conspiracy continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy simply because the\nconspiracy charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4. See Diaz, l76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator\nproduces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, his participation in a conspiracy is presumed to\ncontinue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United States v.\nGreenfield, 44 F.3d ll4l, ll5o (2d Cir. l995))). The defendant therefore remained in a sex\ntrafficking conspiracy with Epstein in 2oo5. And for purposes of analysis under Rule\n8ol(d)(2)(E), it is irrelevant that the Indictment includes a timespan that ends in 2oo4 because\n“t]he conspiracy between the declarant and the defendant need not be identical to any conspiracy\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 65 of l27 65\nLBl5MAX2\n\nl although it is not clear from the document to whom it's\n\n2 directed.\n\n3 MS.

Direct Evidence\n\nAs the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct\nevidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3\noverlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:\nCounts One and Three charge conduct from l994 to 2oo4 in New York and Palm Beach, and\nMinor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in l994, traveling to meet Epstein and\nthe defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s\nrelationship with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that relationship\nincluded conspiring with him and aiding or abeting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.\nRobinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol2). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it\ndid.\n\nEvidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]\ntook actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26\n(2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). Poe\nee\nee\na\n\nFinally, evidence related to Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence as corroboration for the other\nthree Minor Victims. Those Minor Victims will describe a conspiracy that operated to recruit girls\nfor the purposes of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, groom them, and transform the massages into sexual encounters. The\nconspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page6ofl3\nPage 6\n| the same time period, and in some of the same places.\n\nThe fact that Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in relevant jurisdictions has no\nbearing on this analysis. Lawful activity may still be relevant evidence of a crime. For instance,\nevidence that the defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend is relevant and probative even if it is also\nlawful. In a fraud case, evidence that a defendant had significant debts is relevant and probative\neven if those debts involved no illegal activity. Even the overt act requirement of a conspiracy can\nbe satisfied with proof of innocent conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullaev, 76l F. App’x\n78, 84 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (summary order). This evidence is no different. Epstein’s prurient interest\nin girls did not end when the clock struck midnight on their l7\" birthday. The fact that the\ndefendant helped him abuse a l7-year-old is direct evidence of the manner in which she conspired\nwith him to abuse other young women as well, some of whom were in fact belou the age of\nconsent. Minor Victim-3’s testimony is thus intertwined with the conspiracies charged in the case,\nprobative of contested issues at trial, and no more sensational than the charged conduct. It is\ntherefore admissible. Even if it is lawful when evaluated purely in isolation, it is still direct\nevidence.\n\nEvidence related to Minor Victim-3 is also direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts in\nthe Indictment. It is direct evidence for similar reasons as for the Mann Act counts: it speaks\ndirectly to the defendant’s role in the conspiracy, her reasons for participating in it, and the\nconspiracy’s operation. But it is also relevant for the additional reason that it demonstrates the\nreasons for a co-conspirator’s participation in the conspiracy, which is also a central issue at this\ntrial. Specifically, it shous that minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were\ncompensated, and that Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age, typically under the\nage of eighteen. The former is evidence that the defendant and Epstein recruited and enticed girls\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page7ofl3\nPage 7\nto engage in commercial sex acts, an element of the offense. The later is evidence that the\ndefendant and Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors, which requires that the minor victim\nbe under eighteen rather than seventeen.

Rule 4o4(b)\n\nIn any event, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is relevant for multiple purposes that are\npermissible under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFirst, it is relevant to the defendant’s knouledge that the massages were sexualized, an\nissue that is expected to be central at this trial.

The Government expects the\ndefense to argue that the defendant had no reason to assist Epstein in obtaining sexualized\nmassages, especially from young girls. Minor Victim-3 will testify that\nee\nee\nee\nees\n\nThird, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is probative of her intent. “‘Where intent to\ncommit the crime charged is clearly at issue’—l.e., where it is an element of the crime—‘evidence\nof prior similar acts may be introduced to prove that intent.’” United States v. Graham, No. l4 Cr.\n5oo (NSR), 2ol5 WL 6l6l292, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 2o, 2ol5) (quoting United States v. Caputo,\n8o8 F.2d 963, 968 (2d Cir. l987)). The defendant is likely to argue that any steps taken to arrange\nmassages were purely innocent conduct. See id. (“Prior act evidence is admissible to demonstrate\nintent ‘where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation.’” (quoting Zackson,\nl2 F.3d at ll82 (alterations omited))). Evidence of the defendant’s knouledge that massages\nwere sexualized and the defendant’s motives described above is probative of her intent to entice\nand transport minors for the purpose of sexual contact. Minor Victim-3’s sexualized massages\nbegan around the time the conspiracy started, yet the massages continued—with the defendant’s\nactive involvement, as to Minor Victim-3 and other Minor Victims—for years. That is highly\nprobative evidence of her intent as to each of the conspiracies charged in the Indictment. And\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony contains additional evidence of the defendant’s intent. For instance,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 492 Filed ll/22/2l Page9ofl3\nPage 9\n\nthe Government anticipates that Minor Victim-3 will testify that LY\neee\nee\n\nFourth, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is evidence of the conspiracy’s plan or modus\noperandi. “[T]o establish a recurring modus operandi . . . it is enough that the characteristics relied\nupon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\nStates v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984). The patern here is highly idiosyncratic. The\ndefendant identified Minor Victim-3, befriended her, and invited her over. oF\neee\neee\neS\nthis happened during the conspiracy, and at least one of the other Minor Victims will testify to\neach step in this patern. “[T]aken together, they establish the existence of a patern.” United\nStates v. Carlton, 534 F.3d 97, lo2 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nThe defense argues that none of this is probative under Rule 4o4(b) because Minor Victim-\n3 was above the age of consent, so evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is not probative of the\ndefendant’s “intent of doing something illegal,” such as a sex act with a minor. (ll/ol/2l Tr. 82:8-\nl6). That, houever, is just a way of repeating that all the elements of the offense are not satisfied\nas to Minor Victim-3. But evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is probative of central questions\nabout the defendant’s knouledge, motive, intent, and role in the conspiracy. For instance, the\nGovernment expects that the defense may challenge (l) whether the defendant played a role in\nrecruiting girls to give Epstein massages; (2) whether those girls were belou or near the age of\nconsent; (3) whether the defendant instructed those girls to give Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, including by\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document492- Filed ll/22/2l Page loofl3\nPage lo\n\nbeginning with a foot <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>; (4) whether the defendant knew those massages were sexualized;\n(5) whether she intended to arrange sexualized massages for Epstein; (6) whether she asked the\ngirls to find additional girls to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein; (7) whether Epstein and the defendant invited\npeople they had recruited for sexualized massages to travel; and (8) whether the defendant had any\nmotive for doing any of this activity. Ifthe defense wants to concede that she had this knouledge\nand intent, or that she played these roles, but only as to adults, it might reduce the probative value\nof evidence related to Minor Victim-3. See, e.g., United States v. Siddiqui, 699 F.3d 69o, 7o2 (2d\nCir. 2ol2) (“A defendant may . . . forestall the admission of Rule 4o4(b) evidence by advancing a\ntheory that makes clear that the object the Rule 4o4(b) evidence seeks to establish, while\ntechnically at issue, is not really in dispute.”).? But to the extent that the defense argues that the\ndefendant was not aware at all that Epstein’s massages were sexualized, for instance, or that she\nplayed no role in recruiting masseuses for Epstein at all, this evidence is highly probative to rebut\nthose arguments. *\n\nAt its core, the defense argument is that the fact that the defendant and Epstein recruited a\nseventeen-year-old in the United Kingdom to provide sexualized massages to Epstein and to travel\nwith them is not probative of whether they recruited a minor in the United States to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein and to travel with them. The argument is meritless. This evidence\n3 Rither way, Minor Victim-3’s testimony would still be relevant at least on the issue of motive.\nSee Siddiqui, 699 F.3d at 7o2.\n\n* To be clear, the evidence is admissible for the sex trafficking counts as well as the Mann Act\ncounts. See, e.g., Curley, 639 F.3d at 59 (“Although the incidents pre-dated the charged conduct\nby as much as fifteen years, collectively they demonstrate a patern of activity that continued up\nto the time of the charged conduct.”); United States v. Ulbricht, 79 F. Supp. 3d 466, 48o (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol5) (“While the duration of elapsed time between two events can detract from the probative\nvalue of the prior event, temporal remoteness of acts does not preclude their relevancy.” (citations\nand internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\n225, and the broker-dealer had pleaded guilty to manipulate the share price “rather than to execute\nthe private placement, id. at 23l.

Those\nconspiracies operated through a patern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from l994 to 2oo4, across Epstein and the\ndefendant’s various properties. (See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive.

See\nNovember 5 Ltr. at 6-7. The few reasons the government does give are meritless. The\ngovernment starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to prove the sex trafficking\nconspiracy for the same reasons that it is admissible to prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons\nwhich the Court has already rejected. See id. at 6. The government then makes the puzzling\nassertion that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible because it “demonstrates the reasons for a co-\nconspirator’s participation in the conspiracy.” /d. Specifically, the government asserts that the\nevidence shous that (l) “minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were compensated,”\nwhich the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein “recruited and enticed girls\nto engage in commercial sex acts”; and (2) “Epstein was sexually atracted to girls of a certain age,\ntypically under the age of eighteen,” which the government contends is proof that Ms. Maxwell\nand Epstein engaged in sex trafficking of minors under the age of eighteen. Jd. at 6-7.\n\nThese arguments are misguided and unpersuasive. First, neither of the two specific bases\nfor admission speaks to “the reasons for” Ms. Maxwell’s alleged participation in the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy, as the government claims. Second, the two specific bases for admission\nare legally and factually flawed.\n\nAs to the issue of compensation, Po\nLT\nLo\nLT\n2o498o8.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page4ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Accuser-3’s evidence does not shou that Epstein was\natracted to underage girls. At most, it shous that he was atracted to young women above the age\nof consent, which is neither a crime nor evidence ofa crime. The Court recognized this distinction\nat the November | conference in the discussion of Accuser-3’s evidence:\nMS. MOE: ... I think as a mater of common sense, a jury\nunderstanding that the defendant is willing to provide Epstein with\na girl at the age of l7 would certainly speak to her knouledge of\nhis sexual preferences.\nTHE COURT: Why doesn't it speak to a knouledge of sexual\npreferences to someone just above the age of consent?\n2o498o8.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo744o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page 7 ofl2\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nNovember ll, 2o2l\n\nPage 7\nWhile some may find this morally reprehensible, or even repugnant, it is perfectly legal and does\nnot in any way establish a “sexual preference” for underage girls. Moreover, to the extent the\ngovernment is seeking to introduce Accuser-3’s evidence to shou Epstein’s sexual preference for\n“young girls”—which would include women who are young, but still above the age of consent like\nAccuser-3—that would mislead the jury and invite them to convict Ms. Maxwell based on a moral\njudgment of sexual activity which, in the case of Accuser-3, was entirely legal.\n\nSecond, Epstein’s “sexual preference” is impermissible propensity evidence that is\ninadmissible under Rule 4o4(b). Epstein’s alleged “sexual preference” is evidence of his\ncharacter. By its oun admission, the government wants to use Accuser-3’s testimony to prove this\naspect of Epstein’s character and argue that he acted in accordance with this character with the\nother Accusers. That is classic propensity evidence that cannot be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nSee United States v. Buczkouski, No. 5:o8-CR-l59-F, 2oo9 WL lo68l888, at *l (E.D.N.C.

As previously argued, Accuser-3’s evidence does not shou that Ms. Maxwell\nknew Epstein engaged in sexualized massages with underaged girls. See November 5 Ltr. at 7-8.\nAt most, it establishes that she allegedly knew that he engaged in sexualized massages with adult\nwomen.

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol. The government has also\ncautioned that Accuser-3 will likely become emotional and upset if she alloued to describe these\nevents to the jury. The defense does not doubt that this is true. That is precisely why the Court\nmust exclude Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o3.

Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nresponsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways identified by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent relevance. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks sufficient evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition.

The Rules of Evidence are clear that an expert can inform the jury of the\nbases of his opinions. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o3.\n\nSecond, the government claims that Dr. Dietz’s reasoning is “circular.” Mot. at lo. The\ngovernment characterizes Dr. Dietz’s opinion as follous:\n\n[I]t is circular to say that “grooming” “imputes motive and intent,” because\n\ngrooming is defined to be a strategic patern of behavior used to develop\n\nrelationships of atachment and coercion between perpetrators and victims. That is,\n\nif the behaviors lack the requisite motive and intent, they are not grooming\n\nbehaviors.\n\nId. (citing Ex. l, p 3). In an unconsciously revealing way, the government misunderstands Dr.\nDietz’s opinion.\n\nThe government’s objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinion is the very objection that Dr. Dietz has\nto Dr. Rocchio’s opinion. Dr. Dietz is critical of Dr. Rocchio’s view of “grooming” because it\nrisks imputing motive and intent to innocuous conduct “without adequate evidence of either.”\nEx. l, p 3. Dr. Dietz proposes to identify this circular reasoning for the jury, so jurors can\nevaluate Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and decide whether it is worth of belief.\n\nThe risk of imputing motive and intent is not abstract. After all, the government itself\ndoes so. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 4l2 motion, the government flat out said that\n“Te]vidence of grooming is evidence of intent.” Gov’t Resp. to Rule 4l2 Mot., p 7.\n\n435, p ll). To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony, houever, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” (terminology aside, id. at lo), Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as\ndescribed herein.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page5of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Accordingly, photographs that corroborate Jane’s testimony are highly relevant.\n\nThere are two sets of photographs that are particularly corroborative: photographs of\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room and photographs that corroborate details of other portions of Epstein’s\nhouse.\n\nA. The <span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span> Room\n\nJane testified that she was sexually abused in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room of Epstein’s New York\nhouse, and she gave detailed testimony about permanent features of the room.

And then there\nwas just a giant black <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table in the middle of it.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).

A large <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table is\nlocated in the middle of the room:\n\n[Redacted]\nJane explained that the room had a “built-in bookcase on the right-hand side, and there was\na stereo system.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).\n2 In particular, the Government seeks admission of Government Exhibits 9o2 through 9o4, 9l7,\nand 928.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page4of9\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibit 928, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room in fact has a large built-in\nbookcase with a stereo system:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nJane also testified that the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room was approximately the size of a “giant walk-in\ncloset.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o). And more generally, she testified that the building itself had “Lots\nof stone, you knou, old wood.” (/d. at 3l7-l8).\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibits 9o4 and 9l7, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room is about the size of a\nwalk-in closet, and the moldings in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room were made of wood:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nFinally, Jane explained that the artwork in the house included “Paintings of naked women\nand orgies and things like that.” So much so, in fact, that “[i]t didn’t seem very unusual at this\npoint.” (ll/3o/2o2l Tr. at 3l8).\n\nThat description is accurate, as evident from the above photos.

They specifically corroborate\nJane’s memories of the room in which she was sexually abused, shouing that in fact she spent\ntime in that room, a critical fact of the case.\n\nThe Government understands the Court’s point that there has not been testimony\nspecifically comparing these particular photographs to items present during the time period of the\nconspiracy. But most of Jane’s testimony about the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room does not concern “movable\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page5of9\nitems.” (l2/3/2l Tr. at lo76). Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\nwallpaper and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, wallpaper, and artwork shouing nude women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os. But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the relevance of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork. But the photographs of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room are probative\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page6of9\nevidence on a material mater, and they should be admited.\n\nB. Other Photographs\n\nMany of the remaining photographs of Epstein’s house corroborate other testimony by\nJane. As with the nude pictures in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, each of these photographs is consistent with\ntestimony about Epstein’s practices, so they are probative corroboration of that testimony.\n\nFirst, Jane testified that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of sizes while abusing\nher. (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 3lo). Juan Alessi, whose testimony corroborated Jane, also testified that he\nfound two different kinds of vibrating back massagers after Epstein received massages, and that\nthose massagers were kept in Epstein’s bathroom in Palm Beach. (l2/o2/2l Tr. at 894-95).\n\nThe Government recovered two vibrating massagers in the bathroom of the New York\nhome adjacent to the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room. The Government therefore seeks admission of two photos,\nGovernment Exhibits 9l8 and 92l, depicting those two devices:\n\n[Redacted]\nThe point of this evidence is not to shou that these vibrators are the particular vibrators used on\nJane. It is to shou that they are the type that were used on Jane, and corroborate Jane’s testimony\nby shouing that Epstein did, consistent with the modus operandi of the conspiracy from the mid-\nl99os through the early 2ooos, possess this sort of massager device.\n\nSecond, Jane testified that the home contained “creepy looking animals.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at\n3 The Government could not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without\nsubstantially diminishing the probative force of the evidence. Before shouing the photographs to\nJane on the stand, the Government would surely need to shou her the photographs in advance.\nDoing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony about her memories of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room to the photographs, thereby vitiating the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document524 Filed l2/o5/2l Pagelof2\nU.S. Department of Justice\nse, United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o.

According to the\ngovernment, houever, “[b]efore shouing the photographs to Jane on the stand, the Government\nwould surely need to shou her the photographs in advance,” and that would have “‘vitiat[ed] the\nphotographs’ value as independent corroboration.” /d. This is a baseless argument.\n\nThe government easily could have shoued the photographs to Jane for the first time\nduring her testimony, asked her if she recognized them, asked whether the photos accurately\ndepicted the house and <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or at least asked if\nthe photographs looked similar to what the apartment looked like back then. In turn, once the\ngovernment elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it\ncould have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s\nconcer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The\nonly conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would\nnot give the answer the government wanted.\n\nBut even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration,” that’s just hou trials go.

App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o), the court\naffirmed the district court’s authentication of handwriten leters even though no testifying\nwitness confirmed they had previously examined the leters. Instead, testimony that the\n“appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the\nleters were consistent with other leters previously observed was sufficient to satisfy Rule 9ol.\nId. at 24-25.

Finally, cases have\nalloued a witness to authenticate emails under Rule 9ol(b)(4), even if they were not a recipient\nof the specific email being admited, when the witness had a history and familiarity with the\ndefendant’s email communication tendencies.

The final step was for Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to normalize sexual\nsituations and sexual touching so that it would eventually escalate to more serious sexualized\nmassages. Tr. 285l:l8-2852:24.\n\nMoreover, this common method of operation to recruit and “groom” minors was all in\nservice of the same objective: to sexually abuse underage girls. Although this common scheme\nviolated three different statutes and the incidents of abuse took place in different locations, the\ngovernment’s theory as presented to the jury was that it was a single criminal agreement between\nEpstein and Ms. Maxwell, not separate independent conspiracies.\n\nBe Common Overt Acts\n\nThe Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three alleged identical overt acts,\nwhich pertained to each of the four accusers. Ind. {J l3a-e and l9a-e. Because the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy charged in Count Five did not involve Jane, Kate, or Annie Farmer, that\ncount alleged separate overt acts related solely to Carolyn. Ind. 4] 25a-d. As discussed above,\nhouever, Count Five was simply a subset of the larger conspiracy charged in Counts One and\nThree involving Carolyn and other accusers in Florida and did not represent a separate\nconspiracy. See discussion supra.\n\n4. Degree of Interdependence Between the Conspiracies\n\nThis factor requires the Court to consider the extent to which the success or failure of one\nalleged conspiracy is independent of a corresponding success or failure by the other. Macchia,\n35 F.3d at 67l. The conspiracy alleged in Count Three was logically dependent on the success\nof the conspiracy alleged in Count One. The object of both was to first entice and then transport\nminors across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. If the conspiracy\nto entice failed there would, logically, be no one to transport. Similarly, the object of the sex\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8953\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 3o of 37\ntrafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a minor to\nengage in a commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn and others to\ngive sexualized massages to Epstein in exchange for cash, there would be no sex trafficking\ncount.\n\nFor these reasons, Counts One, Three, and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on\nonly one of these counts.\n\nIi. The Court Should Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and Dismiss the S2 Indictment\n\nDue to Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\nThe Court should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the\nIndictment due to the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing this prosecution\nagainst Ms. Maxwell in violation of her due process rights. Ms. Maxwell previously made this\nclaim in her initial and supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. l38, 293). The Court denied the\nmotion each time on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell failed to shou “actual and substantial\nprejudice” caused by the delay. (Dkt. 2o7 at l6-l8; Dkt. 3l7 at lo). The Court, houever,\ngranted Ms. Maxwell leave to renew the motion after the conclusion of trial. (Dkt. 2o7 at l8;\nDkt. 3l7 at lo). Ms. Maxwell nou reasserts the same motion and incorporates the arguments\npreviously made to the Court.\n\nIn addition, the record at trial highlighted numerous other examples of hou the delay in\ncharging this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical\ndocumentary records and witnesses that would have alloued Ms. Maxwell to effectively\nchallenge the government’s proof were no longer available, including the follouing:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8954\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 32 of 37\ntopless <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s recollection of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on commercial flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of commercial flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her recollection of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. Financial Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical financial documents were also unavailable to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even controlled the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 33 of 37\nwhich would have dated her trip to New Mexico, or when Epstein bought tickets to the\nBroadway production of The Lion King for Jane, which she had originally told the FBI she saw\non her first trip to New York. Tr. 5o3-ll.\n\nC. Phone Records\n\nContemporaneous phone records for Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, the accusers, and others that\ncould have been used to rebut the government’s proof were also not available to the defense. For\nexample, Carolyn testified that Ms. Maxwell would call her to set up <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments. Tr.\nl527. This was important evidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the sex trafficking charges in Counts\nFive and Six. Carolyn’s claim could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records.\nHouever, because a complete set of Ms. Maxwell’s phone records—as well as phone records for\nCarolyn, her mother, and her boyfriend—were not available, the defense could not challenge this\nclaim.\n\nD. Property Records\n\nThe defense also did not have access to property records for Epstein’s various residences,\nwhich would have rebuted the accusers’ testimony concerning the timing of the alleged sexual\nabuse. For example, Jane testified that she began being sexually molested by Epstein in his\nhome in New York when she was l4 years old. Tr. 3l6-32o. Jane described the house as\nfollous:\n\n[I]t looked more like a building than a house. It was eight stories, his massive\n\neight-story house building where you walk through these giant doors and then\n\nthere was, like, another security door to go in. And it had an elevator and it was\n\neight stories.\nTr. 3l7. It is clear that Jane was describing Epstein’s tounhouse on East 7l* Street. Moreover,\nher description of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room where she was molested matched photographs of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room at the 7l“ Street house.

First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require interstate transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent.

Overlap in Participants\n\nTurning to the overlap of participants, the evidence at trial established that some—but\nimportantly, not all—participants overlapped between the two conspiracy schemes charged in\nCounts Three and Five. In any event, even if the participants had been identical in both\nconspiracies, the identity of the participants alone would be insufficient to support a claim of\nmultiplicity. See United States v. Coleman Com. Carrier, Inc.,2l9 F. Supp. 2d 563, 565 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo2) (“[T]he existence of a single conduit does not establish proof of a single conspiracy[.]’’)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669).\n\nHere, although the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five both involved the\ndefendant and Epstein, the S2 Indictment charged that, with respect to Count Five, Epstein’s\nemployees participated in contacting a minor victim to schedule appointments for sexualized\nmassages. See Dkt. No. l87, § 25(d). At trial, a victim who testified under her first name, Carolyn,\ntestified about receiving such calls from Sarah Kellen, who worked as a personal assistant to\nEpstein. (Tr. l527). The evidence at trial established that Kellen started working for Epstein in\nor about the early 2ooos. (See, e.g., Tr. 832, l889). Carolyn also testified about an incident in\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 33 of5l\nNew York, whereas the conspiracy charged in Count Five largely concerned conduct that took\nplace in Florida. Although the conspiracy overlapped in geographic scope, the locus of each count\nwas distinct and weighs against a claim of multiplicity.\n\n6. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of Interdependence\n\nFinally, the conspiracies charged in Counts Three and Five were fundamentally\nindependent schemes, with different objectives and modes of operation. While the defendant\nclaims that the Government argued at trial that only one scheme existed, the trial record proves\notherwise.\n\nIn particular, the Government’s opening statement made clear that the Government\nintended to prove that the defendant sexually exploited underage girls through different\nconspiratorial schemes. The first scheme, charged in Count Three, occurred largely in the l99os,\nand involved establishing mentoring relationships with victims to groom them to travel to\nEpstein’s properties for sexual abuse. See Tr. 4o:8-25 (describing an “earlier phase” of the\ndefendant’s crimes that involved developing relationships with victims, and the defendant’s later\nparticipation in a “pyramid scheme of abuse” in which victims recruited other victims for so-called\n“<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” appointments). The second scheme, in the 2ooos, involved paying victims for so-called\n“<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” appointments, where they were sexually exploited. /d. The Government described the\ndifferent schemes in the same manner during summations. See Tr. 2885-87 (describing the\ntimeline of events, and the shift between an earlier scheme and a later pyramid scheme involving\nvictims recruiting victims).\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9595\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 43of5l\none example, the defendant claims that Carolyn’s trial testimony that the defendant called her to\nset up <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments “could have been disproven with contemporaneous phone records.”\n(Def. Mot. at 28) (emphasis added). The defendant’s claim is entirely speculative; she makes no\nclaim about what Carolyn’s phone records, or those of her mother or then-boyfriend, would have\nshoun, and she ignores that the records may well have helped the Government, not her, if they\nwere available.\n\nAs another example, the defendant argues that had the flight manifests been available for\nthe time period charged in the Indictment, '® she “could have used them to challenge whether Jane\nwas on those flights as well as the accuracy of Jane’s recollection of events.” (/d. at 26). The\ndefendant does not establish hou the flight manifests would have helped her. She claims that she\nneeded the flight manifests because the flight logs are incomplete. (/d.). In so arguing, the\ndefendant assumes that the flight manifests were complete'! and contained information that would\n‘o The defendant baldly argues that the flight manifests “did not go back to the time period charged\nin the Indictment” “[b]ecause of the passage of time.” (Def. Mot. at 26). Houever, at trial, Visoski\ntestified that between approximately l994 and 2oo4, he would drop off the passenger manifests he\npersonally completed at Epstein’s main office in New York. (Tr. l72). Similarly, Rodgers\ntestified that he turned over the passenger manifests that he completed to one of Epstein’s\natorneys. (Tr. l8l9). The defendant has not established that such manifests were not available\ndue to any intentionally manufactured delay. See United States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. lo9l,\nlo94 (S.D.N.Y. l973) (“The fact that evidence may be lost or destroyed during the pre-indictment\nstage is inherent in any delay, no mater what the duration. Furthermore, there has been no\nallegation in this case that the destruction of the records was deliberate on the part of either the\ngovernment or trustee.”).\n\n'! The defendant complains that the flight logs kept by Rodgers “were incomplete and often\nidentified passengers simply by their first names or generic identifiers like ‘l female’ or ‘l male’”\nin her efforts to argue that the unavailability of the passenger manifests was material. (/d.). The\ndefendant ignores Visoski’s testimony that when completing the manifest, he “tried to be as\naccurate as [he] could,” but that if he “didn’t knou a passenger name, [he] wanted to put whether\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 49of5l\n2o8o-84 (shopping with Annie in New Mexico and teaching her to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein’s feet), 84o-\n45 (recruiting Virginia and instructing Alessi to bring her to Epstein’s Florida house), l524\n(Virginia receiving money for sex with Epstein), l534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”). That, in combination with evidence of the defendant’s participation in Jane’s\nabuse in New York, is sufficient on its oun for the jury to convict on Count Four. See United\nStates v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“The record is replete with evidence from\nwhich a reasonable jury could infer that sexual access to Jaire was a dominant purpose of Vargas-\nCordon’s repeated transport of her from his New Jersey home into Brooklyn.”); United States v.\nMi Sun Cho, 7l3 F.3d 7l6, 72o (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“Cho does not dispute that one who arranges\n\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643-l Filed o3/ll/22 Page4of6\n“None of that relates to traumatic memory,” he said.

In fact, the conduct in the\n2ooos that Carolyn described was no different than the conduct in the l99os that Jane described.\nLike Carolyn, Jane testified that Epstein gave her money after almost every sexual encounter\nwith him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support a sex trafficking charge. (Tr. 3ol-\no2). Indeed, the government concedes that the only reason it did not expand Count Five to\ninclude Jane and Annie Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to include\nCarolyn’s abuse) was that the sex trafficking statute was not enacted until after their abuse had\noccurred. (Opp. at 28). Had that legal impediment not existed, the government could have, and\nno doubt would have, broadened the date range of Count Five to l994-2oo4, as it had done with\nCounts One and Three, and included overt acts related to Jane. Instead, the government included\na more narrou sex trafficking count based primarily on Carolyn’s allegations from 2ool-2oo4,\nbut still framed all of the charges in the Indictment as the product of a single, decade-long\nscheme between Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to “groom” and recruit minor girls to be sexually\nabused at Epstein’s various residences from l994 to 2oo4. (See Ind. 4 l-2, Overview Section).\nAccordingly, the offenses charged in the Indictment support a finding of multiplicity.\n\nB. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government makes a half-hearted atempt to deny the obvious overlap between\nCounts Three and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 3o-32). For\nexample, the government argues that some “but importantly, not all” of the participants in the\ntwo conspiracies overlapped, and notes that Sarah Kellen, who scheduled <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments\nfor Epstein in Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2ooos during the time period of the sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. (Opp. at 3o-3l). But in the end, the government concedes, as it must,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 24\novert acts alleged in Count Five could easily have been alleged in Count Three because they\nwere in furtherance of the same conspiracy. Hence, the differing overt acts do not indicate\ndifferent conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d at 48 (finding two conspiracies were\nmultiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed in the second conspiracy were not listed\nin the first, because they were “all in furtherance of the broader conspiracy alleged in the first’’).\n\nD. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Degree of\n\nInterdependence\n\nFinally, the government argues that Counts Three and Five were different conspiracies\nbecause they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and modes of\noperation.” (Opp. at 32). In doing so, the government conveniently ignores the argument it\nmade to the jury at trial — namely, that Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer were all victims of\nthe same criminal plan to sexually exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and Ms. Maxwell\ncarried out using the same methods throughout the entire course of the conspiracy. (Tr. 2848)\n(“[Maxwell] ran the same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls.\nThe similarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly\npouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.’’).\n\nThe government atempts to side-step this obvious inconsistency by arguing that the\nconspiracy charged in Count Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstein’s\nproperties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying victims for so-called\n‘<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments,’ where they were sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But “grooming”\nand travel were not exclusive to Count Three. Carolyn testified about being progressively\nintroduced to more serious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. l52l-23,\nl537). She also testified that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his island. (Tr.\nl534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not exclusive to Count Five. Jane testified\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 24\nthat Epstein gave her money after “almost every visit” to his home in Palm Beach. (Tr. 3o2).\nAnd both Jane and Annie Farmer testified about massages. (Tr. 3o8-ll; 2o83-86).\n\nThe government’s atempt to characterize Count Three as an “earlier scheme” and Count\nFive as a “later pyramid scheme” with different objects and methods is unavailing. (Opp. at 32).\nThe government’s theory, as presented to the jury, was that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell engaged in\na single conspiracy with a common method of operation and objective: to recruit and “groom”\nunderage girls to sexually abuse them. That theory was entirely consistent with the evidence at\ntrial. For these reasons, Counts Three and Five describe a single conspiracy, not multiple\nconspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment\nonly on Count Three.\n\nIi. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Other Motions.\n\nFor the reasons already set forth in her initial Motion, the Court should vacate Ms.\nMaxwell’s convictions as to all counts and dismiss the Indictment due to prejudicial pre-\nindictment delay. Further, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because the government failed to prove each\nelement of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court, in the\nalternative, (l) vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on the Mann Act counts (Counts One, Three,\nand Four) and grant a new trial under Rule 33 because the convictions were based on a\nconstructive amendment and/or variance from the allegations in the Indictment, (2) enter\njudgment on only one of the three multiplicitous conspiracy counts — specifically, Count Three,\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagelof45\nUSDCSDNY SS\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagellof 45\nminors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” E.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”’), 2853 (““The paterns you\nsaw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities\nin the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (‘““Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by\nwhat Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and hou she operated for years.”\nId. at 288o; see also id. at 2895—96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a\nbroader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 4o). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its\nclosing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls .. . to introduce <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free .... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.’’).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein. See, e.g., id. at\nl855 (December 2ooo flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-l4 (birth\ncertificate).

Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law.

The government’s claim is based solely on (l) Carolyn’s vague\nrecollection that she stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein in 2oo5 when she was\nl8 years old (Tr. l525, l549), and (2) two message pad slips that were never admited in\nevidence. (GX 4-B, GX 4-F). Such meager and unreliable evidence is insufficient to support a\nfinding that the offense conduct continued into the last two months of 2oo4, especially when that\ndetermination has such a significant effect on the recommended sentencing range. Instead, the\ncredible evidence in the trial record established, at most, that Epstein was receiving sexualized\nmassages in his Palm Beach residence through the summer of 2oo4, before the 2oo4 Guidelines\ntook effect.\n\nCarolyn’s recollection that she was l8 when she stopped seeing Epstein cannot be\ncredited. (Tr. l525, l549). Carolyn’s memory of the timeline of events—in particular, her age\nat the time of the relevant events—was demonstrably inconsistent and unreliable. For example,\nCarolyn initially testified that she was l4 years old when Virginia Roberts first took her to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence, which would have been in 2ool. (Tr. l5l8-l9, l525; GX-ll).\nHouever, when Carolyn was confronted on cross-examination with her prior deposition\ntestimony in 2oo9, she agreed that Virginia first took her to Epstein’s house in May or June 2oo2\nwhen she was l5 years old, as she stated in her deposition. (Tr. l57o-73). Then on redirect\nCarolyn changed her testimony yet again and testified that she first went to Epstein’s house when\nshe was l3 years old, which would have been in 2ooo. (Tr. l693). Carolyn also testified that\nshe was “l5, going to be l6” when she recruited her friend Tatum to give Epstein massages,\nwhich would have been touards the end of 2oo2 or early 2oo3. (Tr. l544).

Although these two messages\nwere labeled as government exhibits along with the rest of the message slips in the same book\n(GX 4-A-K), these messages were never admited in evidence. The Court admited the message\nslips from three other message books (GX l-3) because Juan Alessi and Nicole Hesse recognized\ntheir signatures and/or handwriting in those books and could establish a business records\nfoundation for their admission. (Tr. 877-889, l772-l79o). The government presumably did not\nhave anyone who could do the same for GX 4 or it would certainly have admited the message\nslips from that book as well. The Court should not rely on two isolated, unauthenticated\ndocuments in determining when the offense conduct ended, especially when they would almost\nsingle-handedly increase the recommended sentencing range by over lo years.

In fact, the evidence clearly shoued that by that\ntime, Ms. Maxwell was in a commited relationship with another man and Sarah Kellen had\ntaken over responsibility for scheduling the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments at the Palm Beach residence.\nMs. Maxwell’s assistant, Cimberly Espinosa, testified that by 2oo2 Ms. Maxwell had “moved\non” from Epstein, had stopped coming to the office, and had begun a long-term relationship with\nTed Wait. (Tr. 237o-7l, 2374, 2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Sarah Kellen, whom he\nrecalled seeing for the first time touards the end of his employment in 2oo2, “immediately took\nover” responsibility for answering the phones and scheduling the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments at the\nPalm Beach residence as soon as she was hired. (Tr. 832-33). Carolyn testified that Ms.\nMaxwell called her to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments only in “the first year or two” and that\nSarah Kellen called her thereafter. (Tr. l527). In sum, the record is clear that by 2oo2 or 2oo3 at\nthe latest Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the offense conduct and had been\nreplaced by Kellen.\n\nApplying the 2oo4 Guidelines would significantly increase Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing\nrange based on a finding by a mere preponderance that her co-conspirator Epstein engaged in\noffense conduct in the final two months of 2oo4 that Ms. Maxwell had nothing to do with and\nwas not personally responsible for. That result would be fundamentally unjust and contrary to\nthe purposes of sentencing. See United States v.

According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nappointments for her and took nude pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2.

(Tr. 237o-7l, 2374,\n2378-8o). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering\nthe phones and scheduling the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she\nwas hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when\nMs. Maxwell called her to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.\n(Tr. l527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm\nBeach residence—2ool-2oo2, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn\nrecalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period\nwhen Kellen scheduled her <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments. (Tr. l527). But nothing in her testimony\nindicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to\ndo with the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial\nrecord to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense\nconduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nBoth Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement\napplies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each\nvictim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in\nthe analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no\naggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal\nparticipant in the offense. USSG § 3Bl.l, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence\nwas Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 2o4). He further conceded that his best recollection was\nthat Kellen was “an employee who worked with Epstein.” (Id.).\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 25 of 29\nCounts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any\nof the three offense groups.\n\nSecond, under the 2oo3 Guidelines, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-\npoint enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage\nin a commercial sex act.’ USSG § 2Gl.l(b)(4)(B) (2oo3) (emphasis added). There is no\nevidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the\nenhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups l| and 2).\n\nThird, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide\nsexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nUSSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), Appl.

(Tr. l527-28,\nl543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein\nwithout being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. l548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not\nso influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her.

Summary of Proof at Trial\n\nOn November 29, 2o2l, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On\nDecember 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\nThe proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From l994 to 2oo4, the defendant and\nEpstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport\nthem to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The\ngirls—some of whom were as young as l4 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the\nguise of a “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.” (/d.).\n\nBeginning in approximately l99l, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with\nEpstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the\nearly 2ooos; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a\ndecade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled\nwith rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a\ncouple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant\nenjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time\ntogether in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in\nManhatan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell\nreceived exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-\n' On April l6, 2o2l, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a\nseparate trial. (Dkt. No. 2o7). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at\nthe time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this mater\nand avoiding the trauma of testifying again. (Dkt. No. 574).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page8of55\nside with Epstein, Maxwell also received a tounhouse that Epstein bought for her in New York\nCity, and Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to Maxwell during the timeframe\nof the conspiracy. (/d.).\n\nIn addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, the defendant also supervised Epstein’s\nhouseholds and enjoyed a lifestyle of extraordinary wealth. (/d.). The defendant relished her role\nas “the lady of the house.” (PSR 4 24). When the defendant took charge of Epstein’s homes, she\nimposed strict rules for staff. For example, the defendant helped author and implement a\nhousehold manual, which contained rules for operating the Palm Beach house to “anticipate the\nneeds of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests.” (/d.). Staff were directed to have two sizes\nof notepads marked “Ghislaine Maxwell” and “Lady Ghislaine,” in addition to Epstein’s notepads.\n(/d.). Staff were also instructed on Epstein and the defendant’s breakfast preferences, and the\nitems to keep in Epstein and the defendant’s respective bathrooms. (/d.). The defendant’s\ninstructions extended to massages: she specified the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> oils and lotions for the Palm Beach\nhouse. (/d.). In short, the defendant was waited on hand and foot.\n\nTo protect her criminal activities from exposure, the defendant also fostered a culture of\nsilence at Epstein’s homes. (PSR 49 25, 79). The Palm Beach household manual made clear that\nstaff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that\nstaff member. (PSR ¥ 25; see also PSR at 49 (manual instructed employees to “NEVER disclose\nMr Epstein or Ms Maxwell’s activities or whereabouts to anyone’”’)). And the defendant reinforced\nthe messages of the household manual. She directed Juan Alessi, the former manager of Epstein’s\nPalm Beach villa, to speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look Epstein in the eyes.\n(PSR ¢ 25). Alessi explained during his trial testimony that he understood he was to be “blind,\ndeaf and dumb” and “to say nothing of their lives.” (/d.).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Pageloof55\nEpstein. (PSR § 28). As a result, the defendant and Epstein no longer had to identify and recruit\nvictims themselves. (/d.). Instead, they used money to convince impoverished girls to bring other\nvictims to provide Epstein with sexualized massages. (/d.). Once the girls were in Epstein’s home,\nthe defendant engaged in grooming behavior that normalized the sexualized massages that were\ntaking place with Epstein. (/d.).\n\nAs set forth in the PSR, the defendant targeted vulnerable victims for sexual abuse, causing\nsignificant and lasting harm. The trial evidence focused on six girls who suffered abusive sexual\ncontact as a result of the defendant’s criminal actions: Jane, Kate, Annie, Carolyn, Virginia, and\nMelissa. Details concerning the evidence at trial with respect to the abuse by the defendant and\nEpstein of the six girls are provided in the PSR at {J 3o-74, 8o-82. The defendant was instrumental\nin the abuse of these girls. She personally engaged in sexual abuse when she fondled the breasts\nof Jane, Annie, and Carolyn. And she used her role as a supposedly respectable, glamorous, older\nwoman to lure these victims into a false sense of security. By behaving as though the sexual abuse\nwas normal, the defendant prevented these girls from understanding just hou wrong the abuse was.\nThe defendant also provided Epstein with the cover of an age-appropriate romantic partner, to put\nother adults at ease when interacting with Epstein and when allouing their children to spend time\nwith him.\n\nl. Sexual Abuse of Jane\n\nThe defendant and Epstein met Jane when she was just l4 years old in the summer of l994\nat a summer camp for talented kids. (PSR §[ 3o). Jane was particularly vulnerable, as her father\nhad just passed away (a fact which she had told both Epstein and the defendant upon meeting\nthem), and her family was struggling financially. (PSR §§ 3o-3l). The defendant and Epstein\ncultivated a relationship with Jane, spending time with her at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel2 of 55\nyears old, told the defendant that she lived alone with her mother and that things were difficult at\nhome, the defendant introduced Kate to Epstein in London. (PSR {fj 39-4o). The defendant\ndelivered Kate to a naked Epstein in the defendant’s oun home for massages and told Kate to\n“have a good time.” (PSR 4 4l-42). During these massages, Epstein initiated sexual contact with\nher, puting her hand on his penis and grabbing Kate’s breasts and in between her legs. (/d.).\n\nKate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach, Litle Saint James, and\nNew York City when she was between approximately l8 and 24 years old. (PSR 4 43). Epstein\ninitiated sexual activity with Kate every time she spent time with him from when she was l7 years\nold through her early thirties. (/d.). The defendant brought up sexual topics with Kate, ranging\nfrom talking about hou sexually demanding Epstein was to asking if Kate knew of anyone to give\nEpstein a blou job to remarking that Epstein liked cute, young, prety girls like Kate. (PSR 44).\n\nWhen Kate was approximately l8 years old, Kate visited Epstein and Maxwell at Epstein’s\nvilla in Palm Beach. (PSR 45). The defendant had left a schoolgirl outfit for Kate in the guest\nroom and told Kate that she thought it would be fun for Kate to take Epstein his tea in the outfit.\n(/d.). Kate—alone with only Epstein and the defendant in a place she had never previously\nvisited—complied. (/d.). Epstein raped Kate by engaging in forced intercourse with her. (/d.).\nLater that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she had fun and told Kate that she was a “good girl” and\n“one of [Epstein’s] favorites.” (d.). Epstein engaged in unwanted sexual activity with Kate\nmultiple times during that same trip. (/d.).\n\n3. Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer\n\nThe defendant also took steps to normalize sexual contact with Annie Farmer, who was\nthen l6 years old. In the spring of l996, Annie’s mother, at Epstein’s request, agreed to send\nAnnie to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico for a retreat for a group of 2o to 25 students (both boys\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo547\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel3oof55\n\nand girls) that were academically gifted to discuss college plans and international trips. (PSR\n449). Annie did not want to go to New Mexico after Epstein had caressed and held Annie’s hand\nand rubbed her foot and leg while watching a movie at a theater in New York in December l995.\n(PSR ¥ 48). Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once\nshe understood that the defendant, a groun woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would\nbe there with Annie. (PSR § 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a\nprotector. (PSR § 5o). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for\nsexual abuse.\n\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under\nthe ruse of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. The defendant asked Annie if she had ever had a professional <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and\nsaid that she wanted Annie to have that experience and that she would be happy to give Annie a\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (PSR 452). After telling Annie to get undressed, the defendant gave Annie a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\non a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table while Annie was naked. (/d.). During the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, the defendant rubbed\nAnnie’s body and directed Annie to roll over so that Annie was laying on her back. (/d.). After\nAnnie complied and rolled to her back, the defendant pulled the sheet doun and exposed Annie’s\nbreasts. (/d.). Then, while Annie was naked and isolated on a ranch in the middle of nouhere, the\ndefendant rubbed Annie’s breasts. (/d.). Annie testified that she wanted “badly to get off of the\ntable and have this <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> be done.” (/d.). The defendant sexually abused a teenage girl in an\neffort to groom her for further abuse.\n\nFollouing through on that plan on this same New Mexico trip, Epstein later got into\nAnnie’s bed, cuddled with her, pressed his body into her, and rubbed against her. (PSR § 53). But\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel4of55\nwhen Annie managed to extricate herself from the situation by running to the bathroom, thereby\ndenying Epstein further sexual contact, the defendant seemed “very disinterested” in Annie. (/d.).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase\nof their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a l7-year-old\ngirl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages.\n(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized\nmassages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,\nincluding New York and the Virgin Islands, on Epstein’s private plane. (PSR 457). Virginia\nbrought other teenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (PSR 458). One of those girls was a\nl4-year-old girl named Carolyn who Virginia introduced to the defendant and Epstein at the Palm\nBeach villa in 2ool. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and\nEpstein’s abuse of teenage girls.\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn visited Epstein’s Palm Beach residence more than loo times, during each of which\nshe was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant\nthe very first time she went to Epstein’s house, and she interacted with the defendant multiple\ntimes thereafter. (/d.). On Carolyn’s first visit to the house, the defendant greeted Virginia, who\nintroduced Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can\nbring her upstairs and shou her what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn hou to perform\na sexual <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63). Carolyn performed over loo paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein when she was between l4 and l8 years old. (PSR ¥ 64). The vast majority\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Pagel5oof55\ninvolved the same course of abuse. At some point during each <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, Epstein rolled over and\nbegan masturbating himself. (/d.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he\ntouched Carolyn’s breasts and butocks. (/d.). On one occasion, Epstein atempted to touch\nCarolyn’s vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (/d.). On two occasions,\nEpstein brought other females into the room with Carolyn, who engaged Carolyn in oral sex, and\non one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his penis. (PSR { 72).\nEvery <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> ended with Epstein ejaculating. (PSR 4 64).\n\nThe defendant personally scheduled Carolyn’s massages for approximately the first year\nor two, when Carolyn was between the ages of l4 and l5. (PSR § 66). When the defendant\nscheduled Carolyn for an appointment, she sometimes sent a car to pick Carolyn up. (/d.). At the\ntime, Carolyn was l4 or l5 years old and did not have a license. (/d.). Indeed, the defendant knew\nCarolyn’s age and much of her background because she had multiple conversations with Carolyn\nabout Carolyn’s life. (PSR 4 67). During these conversations, Carolyn revealed that she had\npreviously been sexually abused by a relative, that her parents were separated, and that her mother\nstruggled with addiction. (/d.). The defendant invited Carolyn to travel with the defendant and\nEpstein, but Carolyn explained that because she was only l4 years old, she would not be able to\nget permission to travel. (PSR 4 68). Carolyn was paid several hundred dollars in one-hundred-\ndollar bills after each <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (PSR § 65). Usually, the money was laid out on the table or by\nthe sink in the bathroom, but the defendant personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. (/d.).\n\nThe defendant saw Carolyn fully nude in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room on approximately three\noccasions. (PSR 4 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> but before Epstein had come into the room. (/d.). One particular instance stands out in\nCarolyn’s mind. (/d.). When Carolyn was l4 years old, she had set up the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and was\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel6 of 55\nfully nude when the defendant walked into the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room. (/d.). The defendant told Carolyn\nthat she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for\nmassages. (PSR § 7l). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein, including\nmultiple minors. (/d.). When Carolyn brought girls to <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn\nwould be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and\ntouched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and butocks. (/d.).\n\n6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa\n\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was\nnamed Melissa. (PSR { 8o). Melissa was just l6 years old when she went with Carolyn to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein\nwith massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of l8. (/d.). When Melissa and\nCarolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then\nreturned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s\nfriend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia\n(parents)” were listed in the defendant and Epstein’s black address book under the heading\n“<span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span> — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began\nwith Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.\n\nII. The Pre-Sentence Report and Sentencing Guidelines\n\nThe United States Probation Office, in its Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, recommends\na sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. In making that recommendation, the Probation Office\ncharacterized the defendant’s offense conduct as “heinous and predatory in nature.” (PSR at 67).\nRegarding the defendant’s role, the Probation Office emphasized that “[t]he gravity of Maxwell’s\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 2l of55\nto resolve, and not the jury. Fusco, 56o F. App’x at 45-46 (citing United States v. Norris, 28l F.3d\n357, 369 (2d Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nLacking any authority for her argument, the defendant cites Peugh and offers her oun\nsweeping conclusion that, essentially, the Sixth Amendment requires that all Ex Post Facto issues\nbe resolved by juries. But as the Supreme Court explained in Peugh, “the Sixth Amendment and\nEx Post Facto Clause inquiries are analytically distinct” and “[nJothing that we say today\n‘undo[es]’ the holdings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent sentencing cases.”\nPeugh, 569 U.S. at 549-5o. It is thus unsurprising that the defendant has not located a single case,\nanywhere in the nation, that has concluded, in the nine years since Peugh was decided, that the\ndetermination of which Guidelines Manual to apply implicates the Sixth Amendment. Thus, even\nafter Peugh, a sentencing judge’s fact-finding authority continues to include the authority to find\nwhen an offense ended for purposes of deciding which Guidelines Manual to apply.\n\n2. The Sex Trafficking Conspiracy Continued to 2oo5\n\nThe Indictment charged that the defendant participated in a conspiracy “from at least in or\nabout l994, up to and including at least in or about 2oo4,” and that is exactly what the Government\nproved at trial. (Dkt. No. l87 at l). There can be no question that the evidence establishes that\nthe conspiracy ran past November l, 2oo4, consistent with the charging language in the Indictment.\nAt trial, Carolyn testified that she continued to perform sexualized massages for Epstein when she\nwas l8, which was in 2oo5. Carolyn’s birth certificate was admited at trial as GX ll. Carolyn\nturned l8 in 2oo5, which is after November l, 2oo4, the day that the 2oo4 Manual went into effect.\nIn particular, Carolyn gave the follouing testimony:\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo556\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 29 of55\nsomeone who had been trained not to ask questions and who worked in a culture of silence carried\nout those necessary tasks. Both Larry Visoski and David Rodgers played the essential role of\ntransporting minor victims to different locations, providing a discreet means of ensuring that\nEpstein had access to minor girls for his sexual gratification when he traveled. The defendant\norganized all of those individuals by telling Virginia to shou Carolyn what to do, by scheduling\nCarolyn’s appointments, by giving Alessi innumerable directions, and by providing instructions to\nboth pilots. (PSR [fj 24, 62, 66). Additionally, the defendant supervised all of Epstein’s staff for\nyears, thereby running an extensive operation. Those individuals more than satisfy the definition\nof an extensive operation in which the defendant served as an organizer.\n\nIn any event, this enhancement applies even under the defense’s interpretation of U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l because Maxwell also supervised at least one other knouing participant in Sarah Kellen.\nLarry Visoski testified that he understood Sarah Kellen to be one of Maxwell’s assistants. (Tr.\nl4o). Even if he was not certain that Kellen had that precise title, his understanding is consistent\nwith Maxwell’s role as second in command beneath Epstein over all other employees. (Tr. l39).\nConsistent with Visoski’ s recollection, David Rodgers testified his understanding was that “Sarah\nwas more of Ghislaine’s assistant, but actually she was probably both,” an assistant to the\ndefendant and an assistant to Epstein, again confirming that the defendant supervised Kellen. (Tr.\nl89o). Rodgers also testified that Maxwell was “number two” belou Epstein among Epstein’s\nemployees. (Tr. l8o9-lo). Alessi testified that he did not knou exactly what Kellen’s job\nresponsibilities were, but Kellen took over the “scheduling of massages” in approximately 2oo2.\n(Tr. 833). Carolyn also recalled that even after Kellen took over calling to schedule massages,\nMaxwell was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn arrived for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nappointments. (Tr. l527). Moreover, the household manual makes clear that as of 2oo5, Maxwell\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 3oof55\nwas still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 6o6), and flight records make clear that\nthe defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times\nin 2oo3 and approximately ten times in 2oo4, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).\n\nThe combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when\nMaxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies\n\nPursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a\nparticipant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”\nId. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least lo years older than the minor,” the\nGuidelines provide for “a rebutable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo565\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010573.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 38 of 55\nunderstand what happened, hou it happened and why, and what its\neffect is certainly.\n(Tr. 742-43). Maxwell’s victims trusted her: she was a seemingly respectable woman who shoued\ninterest in them and promised to help them. She was key to the entire operation of the scheme,\nand Epstein could not have commited these crimes without her.\n\nMaxwell befriended her victims, won their trust, slouly broke doun their boundaries, and\nnormalized sexual abuse. For example, Jane testified that the defendant shoued her hou Epstein\nliked to be massaged and hou he liked his penis touched. The defendant did this when Jane was\nonly l4 years old. The defendant was an adult, in her thirties, helping to normalize abusive sexual\nconduct with a young teenager. The defendant’s demeanor was “casual, like it was — like it was\nvery normal, like it was not a big deal.” (Tr. 3o9). When Jane was in her twenties, she described\nMaxwell this way to her boyfriend, who remembered years later hou Jane told him that Epstein\nhad abused her, and the defendant had made her feel comfortable. (Tr. 644).\n\nThe degree to which the defendant manipulated her victims is an aggravating factor in this\ncase. But her abusive conduct did not end with the grooming and manipulation of the victims.\nShe also participated in the sexual abuse of her victims. Not only was Maxwell the person who\nwas most frequently in the room when Epstein abused Jane (Tr. 289), but multiple victims testified\nthat the defendant groped their breasts. (Tr. 3lo (Jane), 2224 (Annie), l536 (Carolyn)). In\nparticular, Annie described a terrifying encounter in which she found herself alone with Maxwell\nat Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, and Maxwell told her to remove her clothing so she could give\nAnnie a “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” during which she rubbed Annie’s breasts. (Tr. 2224; PSR 4 52). That so-\ncalled <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was the defendant sexually abusing a teenage girl.\n\nThe conspiracy in this case was extensive and sophisticated by any metric: it involved\nmultiple victims, at multiple properties in different states, over a span of many years. In order to\n36\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “<span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span> — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\nidentified in the messages were listed as identified minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”). Specifically, in a leter dated July lo, 2oo8, the USAO-SDFL\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo574\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page 2 of 23\nmassages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell’s role in facilitating those\nmassages. Based on all of the information nou before the Court, including a substantially more\ndetailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3\n(Nov. 5, 2o2l); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated\ntestimony may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.\n\nThe Government rightly acknouledged at the November l pretrial conference that Ms.\nMaxwell cannot be found guilty on this witness’s testimony alone for any of the crimes charged\nin the Indictment. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 67:l2-25, 68:l3-l9, 69:4-9, 7o:23-7l:2, 72:22-25. As the\nGovernment acknouledged, with respect to the jury’s determination in this case, this witness is\nnot a victim of any of the crimes charged in the Indictment. See id. at 69:4-9; Nov. lo, 2o2l Tr.\nat l64:l9-l65:3.” Houever, evidence of legal conduct can of course be relevant evidence of\nillegality. And conduct that cannot itself form the basis of a conviction can serve as direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 7o2 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir.\n2ol2) (affirming admission of defendant pimp’s relationship with and control over women who\nworked as prostitutes as direct evidence of l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) charge). Thus some of the\nanticipated testimony described above can serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe alleged conduct as to Witness-3 was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.\n\nPortions of the anticipated testimony may also serve permissible purposes under Rule\n4o4(b), namely proving motive, intent, and knouledge. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(2). The\nwitness is expected to testify about certain statements by Ms. Maxwell. For example, the\n2 At the November l conference, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion to preclude the Government from\nreferring to alleged victims as “victims” and “minor victims.” Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 4.

After reviewing the defendant’s witness list and related material, it appears\nthat certain witnesses are expected to testify about maters that are irrelevant, prejudicial, or\nimproper impeachment.\n\nSpecifically, the Government moves to preclude the follouing:\n\ne Testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino about whether they\n\nparticipated in a sexualized <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> with Jane;\n\ne Testimony from Alexander Hamilton as contained in the affidavit atached as Exhibit\n\nAS\ne Testimony from Dr. Loftus about suggestive activities that did not occur in this case;\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4ofl2\nIl. The Court Should Preclude Testimony by Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly\nBovino About Sexualized Massages with Jane\n\nIt appears that the defendant seeks to offer testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\nKelly Bovino that they did not participate in sexualized massages with Jane. This testimony would\nnot contradict Jane’s testimony at all. But even if it did, such contradiction is impeachment about\na collateral mater through extrinsic evidence, and it is impeachment of supposedly contradictory\nstatements made on cross examination, rather than on direct examination, each of which renders\nimpeachment improper. Such testimony should be precluded.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nOn cross-examination, the defense asked Jane a series of questions about what she had told\nthe Government about other participants in group sexual encounters with Epstein and the\ndefendant. Tr. 523-24. In the course of that testimony, Jane confirmed that she “told the\nGovernment” there was “a woman named Eva” who “joined in” with another woman. Tr. 525-26.\nShe also “remembered” another participant “named Michelle,” who was “short.” Tr. 526-27. And\nfinally, Jane “remembered” a participant “name Kelly,” whose last name Jane also “remembered,”\nand who Jane thought was “‘a model who was older than [Jane].” Tr. 527.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed that Jane told the Government that Jane thought she could\nrecognize photos of at least a few of the participants, but the Government had not shoun her photos\nof Eva, Michelle, or Kelly. Tr. 527, 53o. Despite this line of questioning, defense counsel did not\nshou Jane photos on the stand or ask Jane for last names of any of these individuals or any other\nidentifying information.\n\nB. Discussion\nThe Government expects that the defendant plans to call Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll256\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5ofl2\nKelly Bovino to testify that they did not participate in group sexualized massages with Jane,\nEpstein, and the defendant. The Court should preclude this testimony, which does not contradict\nJane’s, and is in any event improper impeachment about a topic of cross-examination that is\ncollateral to the case.\n\nFirst, the anticipated testimony does not contradict Jane’s. Jane testified that she had told\nthe Government that she remembered group sexualized massages involving “Eva,” “Michelle,”\nand “Kelly.” Defense counsel did not ask Jane, and Jane did not testify, that these people were\nEva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino. The defense had an opportunity to elicit specific\nnames or identities from Jane, such as by eliciting a last name or pointing to a photograph, but they\nchose not to do so. Indeed, defense counsel elicited no description of Eva, and only elicited that\nMichelle was “short.” (Tr. 527). With respect to Kelly, defense counsel only asked whether Jane\ntold the Government that Kelly was an older model whose last name Jane knew—but then chose\nnot to elicit that last name. (/d.)\n\nHaving failed to develop the record, defense counsel cannot nou atempt to impeach Jane’s\ntestimony by calling specific individuals they claim are Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Indeed, as\ndefense counsel is aware, Jane had previously been asked in meetings with the Government about\nEva Dubin, and she answered that she knew Dubin and “does not remember DUBIN being\ninvolved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o at l. That is, Jane knous who Eva Dubin is and has denied\nthat Eva Dubin was involved in sexualized massages. See id.! Testimony from Eva Dubin that\n' In her interviews with the Government, Jane has not always agreed that another “Eva” exists who\nparticipated in massages, as she testified on the stand. Compare 35o9-oo8 at 4 (recalling that Eva\nwould join in) and 35o9-oo9 at 7 (unclear notation in the notes underlying 35o9-oo8 about the\nname of the person who joined the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>) with 35o9-o2o at 2 (not recalling another Eva). But\nJane has been consistent in saying that she knous Eva Dubin and that Jane had no personal\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 ofl2\nYork when she was l7 to atend Professional Children’s School. (Tr. 349).\n\nJane’s sexual activity when she was an adult is entirely collateral to this case. Consistent\nwith Rule 4l2, the parties could not have offered independent evidence about who else participated\nin Jane’s sexual activity over the age of consent. See Dore, 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6 (defining\n“maters which are not collateral” as “those maters which are relevant to the issues in the case and\ncould be independently proven.”). Accordingly, as the Government explained as part of the\nlitigation over Rule 4l2, the Government offered only brief testimony on direct about Jane’s\nrelationships after the age of consent in order to conclude the narrative. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at l6o).\nSpecifically, the Government asked about five questions establishing that, after Jane moved to\nNew York and turned l8, she spent time with the defendant and Epstein and continued engaging\nin sexualized massages. (Tr. 349-5o).\n\nThe defendant proposes to do something quite different. The anticipated testimony is, at\nleast in part, an atempt to substantively impeach Jane on the identities of individuals with whom\nshe had adult sexual contact. ee\nee\nee Both are not relevant or subjects of independent proof in\nthis case—they are collateral.\n\nThird, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane, and even if the testimony were\nabout a non-collateral mater, it is impeachment by contradiction of a fact elicited on cross-\nexamination. This is precisely the sort of impeachment that the rules are intended to prohibit.\nAbsent Jane’s testimony on cross, it would be irrelevant and improper for the defendant to call\nwitnesses to say that they did not have sexual activity with Jane and the defendant.

The government claims that testimony from Eva, Michelle,\nand Kelly is inadmissible because: (l) it does not contradict Jane’s testimony; and (2) it is\nimproper impeachment on a collateral mater. The government is wrong.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOn the stand, Jane alleged that several other women were involved in sexual conduct and\ngroup sexualized massages with her, Mr. Epstein, and Ms. Maxwell. These women included Eva,\nMichelle, and Kelly. TR. at 523-3o.

But Eva, Michelle, and Kelly will all testify they were\nnot involved in and cannot “confirm” the group sexualized massages. Their testimony\ncontradicts Jane’s testimony, and it is relevant, material, and exculpatory. Finally, the details of\nthe group sexualized messages, which form the very basis of the charges in this case, are not\ncollateral maters. They are what this case is about.\n\nARGUMENT\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause .. . , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” Jd. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors .. . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v. Van\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 68o (l986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l8 (l974)). “Cross-\nexamination is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of [her]\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3ofl3\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l6, 2o2l\nPage 3\ntestimony are tested.” Davis, 4l5 U.S. at 3l6. The importance of cross-examination cannot be\noverstated where, as here, the government’s proof depends almost entirely on the uncorroborated\ntestimony of the accusers. Poventud v. City of New York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL\nlo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2ol5) (“Second Circuit case law . . . clearly establishe[s] that\nimpeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed. The disclosure\nof impeachment evidence, where ‘the [g]overnment’s case depended almost entirely on [the\nvictim’s] testimony,’ goes to the heart of Brady and Giglio.” (quoting Giglio v. United States,\n4o5 U.S. l5o, l54-55 (l972))).\n\nThe standard for relevance is “very lou,” United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246 (2d\nCir. 2ol2) (explaining that Rule 4ol prescribes a “very lou standard”), and the definition of\nrelevance is “very broad,” United States v. Certified Envil. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 9o (2d Cir.\n2ol4). “Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.”\nFed. R. Evid. 4ol. “To be relevant, evidence need not be sufficient by itself to prove a fact in\nissue... .” United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d lo2, l32 (2d Cir. 2olo). “[UJnless an\nexception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’” White, 692 F.3d at 246.\n\nThe testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly, is relevant, because it makes it less likely that\nJane engaged with sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. During her\ntestimony, Jane claimed that Eva, Michelle, and Kelly were all involved in or could confirm the\nsexualized massages involving Jane, Mr. Epstein, and Ms. Maxwell. Eva, Michelle, and Kelly\nare going to testify that they were not involved in sexualized massages and cannot “confirm”\nJane’s story. The testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly is relevant because it makes it less likely\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These alleged sexualized massages are the basis\nof the charges in this case.\n\nThe government seeks to preclude testimony from Eva, Michelle, and Kelly on the\nground that their testimony does not contradict Jane’s allegations and that, in any event, their\ntestimony concerns “collateral maters” The government is wrong on both counts.\n\nA.

TR at 262-63.\n\ne Jane told the government that “Eva” was Mr. Epstein’s “ex-girlfriend and they stayed\nfriends.” See 35o9-oo8 p 7.\n\ne Inan August 2o2l interview with the government, see 35o9-o2o, Jane told the\ngovernment that “Eva” was the “Ms Sweden Lady.” /d. at l. Jane said she “does not\nremember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva “aged out of that.” Jd.\n\ne Although Jane did not recall Eva being involved in the massages when she spoke with the\ngovernment in August 2o2l, she admited that she did “not recall there being another\nEva.” /d. at 2.\n\nThe upshot of Jane’s statements is this:\nDOJ-OGR-oooll367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 6ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l6, 2o2l\nPage 6\n\ne In February 2o2o, Jane told the government that Eva was Mr. Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and\nthey stayed friends, just as Mr. Visoski testified. When the group massages began to\ninvolve others beyond Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell joined in with Sophie and Eva. Sophie\nand Eva “knew the routine.”\n\ne In August 2o2l, Jane told the government that Eva was the “Ms Sweden Lady” (Mr.\nVisoski testified that Eva Dubin was a former Ms. Sweden). At the time, Jane did “not\nremember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva “aged out of that.” Jd. At\nthe same time, Jane “did not recall there being another Eva.”\n\ne Inher testimony in this case, Jane told the jury that Eva was involved in the group\nsexualized massages with Mr. Epstein, Sophie, and Ms. Maxwell, that she “knew the\nroutine,” and that she “could confirm her story.”\n\nThe record is clear that Jane has previously claimed (in February 2o2o) and testified (in\nthis case) that Eva Dubin was involved in the sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell. Given that allegation, Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to call Eva Dubin to the\nstand and present her testimony, which will deny the allegations and contradict Jane’s claims.\n\nPerhaps hoping this Court won’t notice, the government buries most of the facts about\nJane’s allegations about Eva in a footnote. Gov. Leter, pp 5-6 n.l. But even that footnote\nmischaracterizes what Jane said about Eva. Jane did not tell the government that Eva Dubin was\nnot involved in group sexualized massages. At most, Jane said she “does not remember DUBIN\nbeing involved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o, p l. But that’s contrary to what she said in February\n2o2o, and it’s contrary to what she said on the stand. And it’s wholly inconsistent with Jane’s\nstatement that she “does not recall there being another Eva.” /d. at 2.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Michell Healy’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony.\n\nMichelle’s testimony will also contradict Jane’s testimony. As to Michelle, this is what\nJane testified to on the stand:\n\ne There was a fourth woman Jane remembers, named Michelle, who was short. TR at 526.\n\ne Jane hung out with Michelle and Emmy and sometimes went out with Michelle and\nEmmy. /d. at 527.”\n\ne Michelle “was also involved in the sexual contact.” /d.\n\ne Michelle was also involved in “group massages.” /d.\n\nThe government did not examine Jane on any of these points, and it did not ask Jane\nwhether Michelle was only involved in group massages with Mr. Epstein after Jane atained the\nage of l7.3 Nor did the government ask Jane during its interviews when Michelle was involved\n\n> The government’s leter conveniently omits this testimony from Jane, which, as\ndescribed belou, establishes that Michelle Healy is the Michelle who Jane alleged was involved\nin group sexualized massages.\n\n3 The government’s atempt to bootstrap Rule 4l2 into its motion fails. Gov. Leter, p 7.\nIn her interview with the government, Jane said she was involved with sexualized massages with\nMichelle in New York when she was “young.” See 35o9-ool, p 4. Even if, based on Jane’s trial\ntestimony, one might infer she was l7 years old at the time of the sexualized massages with\nMichelle, she said something different in her interviews with the government. And in any event,\nbecause the sexualized massages are the very conduct at issue in this case and are not collateral,\nMs. Maxwell does not have to accept Jane’s trial testimony as the last word on the issue. “The\nlaw of evidence has long recognized that a cross-examiner is not required to ‘take the answer’”\nof a witness on a non-collateral issue, United States v. Harvey, 547 F.2d 72o, 722 (2d Cir. l976),\nsuch as her allegations about the very conduct she says is criminal.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember l6, 2o2l\nPage 8\nin the group massages. To the contrary, in a September 2ol9 interview, Jane told the government\nthat Emmy and Michelle “were involved in the sexual contact.” See 35o9-ool, p 4. Jane made\nthis claim about Michelle when discussing the abuse she claims to have suffered in New York\nwhen she was “‘young.” /d.\n\nMichelle’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony because she will deny being\ninvolved in the sexualized massages that Jane claims she was a part of.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, there is no doubt Michelle Healy, who Ms.\nMaxwell intends to call as a witness, is the same “Michelle” who Jane claimed both during her\ntestimony and her September 2ol9 interview was involved in group sexualized massages with\nMr. Epstein. Jane told the government in September 2ol9 that Michelle was “short” and that she\nintroduced Jane to “white Russians,” a vodka cocktail. See 35o9-ool, p 4. Michelle Healy is\nshort, and Michelle will testify that she drinks white Russians. And, as Jane testified on the\nstand, Michelle will testify that she was good friends with Emmy Taylor, a point the government\nignores in its leter.\n\nAs with Eva, Ms. Maxwell has a right to present the testimony of Michelle, who will\ndeny Jane’s allegations of being involved the group sexualized massages that are the basis of the\ncharges in this case.*\n\n* Michelle has other relevant testimony to offer, in addition to contradicting Jane’s\naccount of the group sexualized massages. The government does not challenge this other\ntestimony.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 9ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As to Kelly, this is what Jane\ntestified to on the stand:\n\ne Kelly was “another person [Jane] remembered.” TR at 527.\ne Jane remembered Kelly’s last name. /d.\n\ne Kelly was a model who was older than her. /d.\n\ne Kelly could “back up what [Jane] was talking about.” /d.\n\nDuring her February 2o2o interview with the government, Jane told agents that Kelly’s\nlast name was “Bovino” and that Jane “felt [Kelly] could back up what [Jane] had talked about\nregarding Maxwell. Jane described Kelly as being a model, who was older than [Jane] and knew\nEpstein and Maxwell before she did.” See 35o9-oo8, p 5-6.\n\nKelly’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony because Kelly will not back up Jane’s\naccount of the sexualized group massages. And there is no doubt Kelly Bovino, who Ms.\nMaxwell intends to call as a witness, is the same “Kelly” who Jane claimed was “back up” what\nJane alleged. Jane admited that Kelly’s last name was “Bovino.”\n\nAs with Eva and Michelle, Ms. Maxwell has a right to present the testimony of Kelly,\nwho will contradict Jane’s testimony about the sexualized massages that are the very basis of the\ncharges in this case.\n\nD. These are not collateral maters.\n\nThe government’s invocation of Rule 6o8 and the phrase “collateral issue” miss the mark\nentirely. As to Rule 6o8, the testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly is not being offered “to prove\nspecific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to atack or support the witness’s character for\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page lo of l3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Their testimony is direct evidence about the very conduct at\nissue in this case—the alleged sexualized massages that form the basis of the charges. Jane says\nshe was abused during group sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and others and that these\nother people could confirm her story or back up what she was saying. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ncall Eva, Michelle, and Kelly, who will deny being involved in the group sexualized massages,\nwhich are the basis of the charges in this case, and will do anything but “back up” or “confirm”\nwhat Jane has alleged.\n\nThese are not “collateral” issues.

Here, Eva, Michelle, and Kelly’s testimony is not being offered to atack\nJane’s “character for truthfulness.” To the contrary, it is being offered to shou that the\nsexualized massages did not happen.\n\nJane has claimed that Eva, Michelle, and Kelly are essentially eyewitnesses to the abuse\nshe allegedly suffered at the hands of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. Eva, Michelle, and Kelly\nwill deny that. The testimony of an “eyewitness” to the very conduct alleged to be criminal is not\na “collateral issue.”\n\nRule 6o8 bars “extrinsic evidence only if the sole purpose for offering the evidence was\nto prove the witness’ character for veracity.” Jd.

As this Court well knous, the accusers have been\nanything but consistent on this front.\n\nAccuser-4, for example, was first interviewed by the FBI about Epstein in 2oo7. At that\ntime, she told the agents that she was recruited to provide massages to Mr. Epstein by Virginia\nGiuffre, f/k/a Roberts, not Ms. Maxwell. She did not describe any grooming by Ms. Maxwell or\neven any participation by Ms. Maxwell in any crime. In this interview, Accuser-4 describes Ms.\nGiuffre as the person who shoued her what to do with Epstein and relates that Ms. Giuffre had\nsex with Mr. Epstein while Accuser-4 watched. Sarah Kellen was her contact person and the\nperson who took naked photos of Accuser-4 in exchange for $5oo. Ms. Maxwell’s name does not\nappear in the FBI 3o2.\n\nShortly after this interview Accuser-4 sued Epstein and Kellen, not Maxwell. The first\ncomplaint, filed in Florida state court does not mention Ms. Maxwell. The complaint was\namended and removed to U.S. District Court and in over 2oo paragraphs Ms. Maxwell’s name\nappears not once. In her answers to writen discovery and in deposition testimony Accuser-4\ndoes not accuse Ms. Maxwell of any misconduct, but instead affirms that she has told the entire\nstory which, according to Accuser-4 (then), began in 2oo2 and ended in 2oo3.\n\nThese claims were setled by Accuser-4 for a substantial amount of money and a release\nwas executed for all claims against Epstein, Kellen, and related individuals or entities. It was not\nuntil after Epstein died and one month after the EVCF was created that the lawyers for Accuser-4\ncontacted the government to say that Accuser-4 wanted to meet.

I overrule this objection for the same reasons as\n\n7 articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the\n\n8 trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein\n\n9 isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their\nlo families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to\nll New Mexico. Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the\nl2 Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant.\n\nl3 Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two\n\nl4 objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and\n\nl5 Epstein developed a scheme that created a \"constant stream of\nl6 girls who recruited each other.\" And, second, she objects to\nl7 the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other\n\nl8 minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages.\n\nl9 Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I\n2o overrule the objection. It supported the information in these\nal paragraphs. The evidence indicated the scheme started with the\n22 defendant's recruitment of Virginia.

The probation department adopted the government's\n\nl5 suggestion, revised the paragraph to assert that the defendant\nl6 is responsible for the victimization of additional minor\n\nl7 victims.

Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages. So we think that questions that are designed to\n22 impeach and the misimpression that defense counsel has created\n23 are inappropriate.\n24 And for those reasons, we would object.\n25 THE COURT: So the specific objection is to other than\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool42o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 98 of l97 2639\nLCHCmax3 Dubin —- direct\n\nl what I alloued in overruling your motion to preclude is\n\n2 timeframed.

There\nl6 has been testimony by all of the witnesses that she was not\nl7 only participating and facilitating the sexual encounters but\nl8 that she participated. So we have testimony from Jane that she\nl9 was involved, that Ms. Maxwell was involved in the group\n2o sexualized massages.

She knew, she was complicit, she is guilty.\nl3 Ladies and gentlemen, that's eight reasons why you\n\nl4 knou the defendant is guilty. Let's turn and talk about the\n\nl5 charges against the defendant.\n\nl6 Here are the six counts. I'm going to talk through\n\nl7 them briefly, but I want you to keep in mind that Judge Nathan\nl8 will give you detailed instructions about the law, and you\n\nl9 should listen closely when she does. What Judge Nathan says\n2o about the law controls here.\n2l First, I want to talk to you about something called\n22 aiding and abeting. For counts Two, Four, and Six, which\n23 we're going to discuss in just a moment, Maxwell is guilty if\n24 she commited those crimes herself, but you can also find her\n25 guilty under an aiding and abeting theory. In other words, if\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 257 2893\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl tea in that schoolgirl outfit and Epstein initiated sexual\n\n2 contact with Kate, later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she\n\n3 had fun. Maxwell told Kate that she was a good girl.\n\n4 Kate also told you about hou Maxwell complained about\n5 Epstein's need to have sex three times a day, hou Maxwell was\n\n6 constantly looking for someone to give him bloujobs. That\n\n7 makes it crystal clear exactly what Maxwell intended when she\n\n8 was taking Jane on these trips. Jane was there to satisfy\n\n9 Epstein's constant need for sexual gratification. The evidence\nlo proves to you that Maxwell is guilty on Count Four.\n\nll Nou let's talk about Count Six, it's sex trafficking\nl2 an individual under age l8. This count is about Carolyn.\n\nl3 The first element is that the defendant knouingly\n\nl4 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or\n\nl5 obtained Carolyn. You heard about hou the defendant called\n\nl6 Carolyn for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments with Epstein. She was\n\nl7 recruiting, enticing, providing, and obtaining Carolyn every\n\nl8 single time she did that.\n\nl9 The second element is that the defendant knew that\n2o Carolyn was under age l8. Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a\nal l4-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again\n22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,\n23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother\n24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just\n25 dropped out of middle school. There just can't be any question\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 257 2894\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl that Maxwell knew Carolyn was underage.\n\n2 And we're talking about the counts one by one, but I\n\n3 want to step back and ask you to keep in mind, you don't have\n\n4 to set aside all of the evidence you heard in this case when\n\na you examine each count, it's the opposite. The patern\n\n6 throughout the case tells you that the defendant knew these\n\n7 girls were under age and she knew that they were going to be\n\n8 molested. You should consider all of that evidence as you\n\n9 examine each count.\n\nlo The third element of Count Six is that the defendant\nll knew Carolyn would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\nl2 And here, a commercial sex act just means a sex act in exchange\nl3 for money. That's what happened to Carolyn. She was paid\n\nl4 hundreds of dollars every time that she was abused. Sometimes\nl5 Maxwell handed over the cash herself.\n\nl6 And we've been talking all morning about the\n\nl7 overwhelming evidence that Maxwell knew these girls would be\n\nl8 sexually abused in those so-called massages. She absolutely\n\nl9 knew.\n2o Finally, there is a fourth element here. In\n2l interstate commerce here means something a litle different\n22 than the first two counts we talked about. We're not talking\n23 about travel across state lines. Instead, we're talking about\n24 an effect on interstate commerce.\n25 So when Carolyn got packages from New York, when she\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 62 of 257 2895\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl was abused on a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table that was manufactured in\n\n2 California, that proves that there was at least a minimal\n\ni) effect on interstate commerce, which is all that's required for\n4 this count.\n\n5 Finally, there are three conspiracy counts that charge\n6 Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein to commit the three crimes\n7 that we just talked about. I expect Judge Nathan will instruct\n8 you that a conspiracy just means an agreement to break the law.\n9 The crime is the agreement and taking some step to carry it\n\nlo out. So the question for you here is, did Maxwell agree with\nll Epstein to commit these crimes. The conspiracy counts are\n\nl2 counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl3 The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4.\nl4 Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie. Those counts\nl5 charge a conspiracy related to enticement and travel, as we've\nl6 just discussed. We've already talked about hou Maxwell and\n\nl7 Epstein completed these crimes as to Jane. For the conspiracy\nl8 charges, even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused\nl9 in New York, everything about the defendant's and Epstein's\n2o interactions with those girls makes it clear that that is what\n2l they both intended. Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as\n22 part of a broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with\n23 underage girls for abuse. You heard about all of the steps the\n24 defendant took in those years in furtherance of that\n25 conspiracy, hou Maxwell traveled with Jane and groomed Annie\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 63 of 257 2896\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York,\n\n2 hou the defendant asked Carolyn to travel, too. This went on\n\n3 for years.\n\n4 Count Five is the sex trafficking conspiracy count\n\n5 which spans from 2ooo to 2oo4, and this count relates to\n\n6 Carolyn and Virginia. You heard about the steps the defendant\n7 took in those years with Carolyn and Virginia. She was taking\n8 steps to traffic girls for sex, recruiting Virginia Roberts at\n9 Mar-a-Lago, transporting Virginia to other states with Epstein,\nlo sending Carolyn up to the Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room on her first\nll visit, calling Carolyn for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments in Florida so\nl2 that she could engage in commercial sex acts. The defendant\n\nl3 took so many steps in furtherance of the conspiracies charged\nl4 in the indictment, the evidence about that was overwhelming, it\nl5 went on for years.\n\nl6 But let me say this, because it's very important. For\nl7 each of the conspiracy counts, to find the defendant guilty,\n\nl8 you only have to find that she did it once, that there existed\nl9 one moment in time in all of those years where she agreed to do\n2o this, and that Maxwell or Epstein took some step to carry out\n2l the agreement. That's it. If you find that one moment\n22 happened, the defendant is guilty.\n23 Let me say one last thing about the law. For each of\n24 the counts, I expect Judge Nathan will instruct you about\n25 something called venue. We're required to prove that it's more\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 64 of 257 2897\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl likely than not that just one act in furtherance of the crimes\n2 took place here in the Southern District of New York.

If that were\nl7 the case, then any dwelling that contained any property that\n\nl8 had come out of state would have affected interstate commerce.\nl9 There is no evidence that the table was purchased, when it was\n2o purchased, and whether it was purchased in connection with the\n2l offenses charged. It is unlike the cases where property is\n22 stolen, and that property is for resale and affects interstate\n23 commerce.

The Court admited those over our\n7 hearsay objection with the limiting instruction.

I expect that Judge\n24 Nathan is going to instruct you that the government is not\n25 required to use any particular investigative techniques.

Whether criminal activity is extensive is based\n2 primarily on the number of people involved, criminally and\n\n3 noncriminally, rather than on other possible indicators of the\n4 extensiveness of the activity.

The\n\nl9 defense counsel could and did ask Jane when she testified who\n2o was in the room during the massages.

Your Honor, this is an issue I\n\n3 believe we raised in advance of trial about the relevance of\n\n4 asking witnesses about uncharged conduct and whether the\n\n5 defendant or Epstein commited crimes in other instances that\n\n6 are not charged. I think the foundation here is about the\n\n7 entirety of a very broad relationship between, I think, the\n\n8 l98os and the present, and the question is whether, over\n\n9 several decades, she was aware of any kind of inappropriate\n\nlo conduct with other people. It's extraordinarily broad. And as\nll we briefed in advance of trial, there is no relevance, it's\n\nl2 inappropriate to suggest that there are uncharged conduct on\n\nl3 other occasions is probative of what happened with the\n\nl4 particular individuals at issue in this case. So we think this\nl5 line of questioning is inappropriate.\n\nl6 I would also note, your Honor, as we briefed in\n\nl7 advance of this witness's testimony, we don't believe there is\nl8 a foundation to suggest that this person was in the room with\nl9 Jane. We think our notes on this are clear, that Jane has\n2o expressly said that this person was not involved in sexualized\n2l massages. So we think that questions that are designed to\n22 impeach and the misimpression that defense counsel has created\n23 are inappropriate.\n24 And for those reasons, we would object.\n25 THE COURT: So the specific objection is to other than\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool6826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 763 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 98 of l97 2639\nLCHCmax3 Dubin —- direct\n\nl what I alloued in overruling your motion to preclude is\n\n2 timeframed.

That's\nl7 what Mr. Alessi had to do.

It is a\n\n2 pouerfully incriminating document.\n\n3 So I want to start by going back to the household\n\n4 manual. And what the manual shous you is that Maxwell and\n\n5 Epstein had a phone directory, and they kept several copies of\n6 it in the house. There was a copy in the pool area, there was\n7 a copy in their cars, there was a copy of it in the master\n\n8 bedroom, and most importantly, there was a copy right on\n\n9 Maxwell's desk.\n\nlo Here's the part of the manual that tells you that.\n\nll There was a copy on her desk.

Use your common sense, ladies and gentlemen.\n2 When you contact a professional masseuse, you don't need to\n\n3 call her mom or dad. Just looking at this page tells you that\n4 none of this was legitimate. These were millionaires who could\n5 hire the top <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> therapists in the whole world, but Maxwell\n6 had a book with dozens of entries in a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> section that\n\n7 makes absolutely clear that these were not real massages by\n\n8 professional masseuses. In fact, this book makes clear that\n\n) some of the entries were for kids.\n\nlo So let's talk about one of those entries. The entry\nll here on the left is Virginia, parents.

He was an employee at\nl7 Mar-a-Lago, which, as Juan Alessi testified, is the place where\nl8 Maxwell met Virginia Roberts. Take a look at the phone number\nl9 listed for Sky Roberts on this document. It's the same number\n2o on Government Exhibit 52-G, the contact book.\n2l And Virginia is also, by the way, on flight records\n22 with Maxwell when she was l7 years old.

One girl\n\n7 would bring another, who would bring another.\n\n8 Ladies and gentlemen, this book, Maxwell's book, it\n\n9 proves to you that Maxwell is guilty. What you'll see in this\nlo book corroborates the witnesses who testified at this trial.\n\nll She had victim names writen in a litle black book. This\n\nl2 document is pouerful evidence of the defendant's knouledge and\nl3 intent. These were not real massages. What was happening was\nl4 sexual abuse with underage girls. Maxwell knew it, she was\n\nl5 part of it, she was responsible for it, and the fact that she\nl6 had a litle black book with her victims' names in it proves to\nl7 you that she is guilty.\n\nl8 That brings us to the seventh reason that you knou\n\nl9 Maxwell is guilty. It's the money. Nou, we've already talked\n2o about Epstein's luxurious lifestyle and all of the perks that\n2l Maxwell got from being his partner in crime, but it wasn't just\n22 geting to live in the mansions and flying on the private jets,\n23 maxwell got millions of dollars from Epstein. You learned that\n24 between l999 and 2oo7, Jeffrey Epstein gave Maxwell about $3o\n25 million, and you knou exactly what that money was for.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017073.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 52 of 257 2885\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl First, in l999, Epstein sent Maxwell $l8.3 million.\n\n2 $l8.3 million — here's the transaction. And then, in 2oo2,\n\n3 Epstein paid Maxwell $5 million — here's the transaction. And\n4 last but not least, in 2oo7, Epstein paid Maxwell $7.4 million.\n5 $l8.3 million, $5 million, $7.4 million. It's a total of\n\n6 $3o.7 million.\n\n7 At this point, you got to ask yourselves, what was\n\n8 Maxwell doing for Epstein that was worth more than $3o million?\n9 Your common sense tells you that you don't give someone\n\nlo $3o million unless they're giving you exactly what you want,\n\nll and what Epstein wanted was to touch underage girls. When\n\nl2 Maxwell took that money, she knew what it was for and nou you\nl3 do, too. It was payment for commiting terrible crimes with\n\nl4 Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nl5 That brings us to reason number 8 that you knou that\nl6 Maxwell is guilty. When you zoom out and look at the big\n\nl7 picture, the timeline over the years, it's obvious that Maxwell\nl8 spent a decade aiding and abeting Jeffrey Epstein's crimes,\n\nl9 that they were coconspirators, partners crime.\n2o Let's talk about the timeline the big picture.\n2l In l994, Maxwell met Jane. In that same year, Maxwell\n22 and Epstein started sexually abusing Jane, and that often\n23 happened in the context of massages. That same year, in l994,\n24 Maxwell met Kate, too, and Epstein initiated sexual contact\n25 with Kate also in the context of massages, massages in which\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017075.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 54 of 257 2887\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl in Epstein's Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room. Maxwell called to\n\n2 schedule some of the appointments. Carolyn was l5, l6, and l7\n3 years old.\n\n4 Remember hou the defense tried to suggest to you that\n5 because Maxwell had started dating some other guy named Ted\n\n6 Wait around 2oo4, she was no longer around Epstein. You knou\n7 that's not true and here's why. You saw that household manual,\n8 Government Exhibit 6o6, that was dated in February of 2oo5, the\n9 manual that outlined what Epstein and Maxwell demanded in the\nlo Palm Beach house. She was still the lady of the house. And in\nll 2oo5, the Palm Beach Police Department searched Epstein's\n\nl2 house. And what did the police notice during their search?\n\nl3 They found a desk with Ghislaine Maxwell's stationery on top.\nl4 And in 2oo7, two years later, Epstein paid Maxwell\n\nl5 $7.4 million.\n\nl6 When you take a step back and you look at this\n\nl7 timeline and think about the big picture, it is crystal clear\nl8 that Maxwell knew about and was deeply involved in Epstein's\n\nl9 sexual abuse of children.\n2o Take a moment and just reflect on hou deeply strange\n2l this whole situation was. For years, Maxwell took trips on\n22 Epstein's private planes with Epstein and teenage girls. For\n23 years, Maxwell was right by Epstein's side as numerous teenage\n24 girls came to visit him inside his homes. There were teenage\n25 boys, by the way.

For years, she kept a list in her\n\n2 litle black book with dozens of female names, definitely no\n\n3 boys. For years, Maxwell lived in houses with Epstein that\n\n4 were decorated with nude females, including sexualized pictures\n5 of girls. For years, Maxwell slept in a bedroom in Palm Beach\n6 that had two bathrooms atached to it, one filled with nude\n\n7 drawings and stocked with a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and all the different\n8 types of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> oils and lotions that Epstein liked, and the\n\n9 other, Maxwell's bathroom where the dildo was stored. And over\nlo those years, Epstein paid Maxwell millions and millions of\n\nll dollars. Ladies and gentlemen, look at the big picture and use\nl2 your common sense. She knew, she was complicit, she is guilty.\nl3 Ladies and gentlemen, that's eight reasons why you\n\nl4 knou the defendant is guilty. Let's turn and talk about the\n\nl5 charges against the defendant.\n\nl6 Here are the six counts. I'm going to talk through\n\nl7 them briefly, but I want you to keep in mind that Judge Nathan\nl8 will give you detailed instructions about the law, and you\n\nl9 should listen closely when she does. What Judge Nathan says\n2o about the law controls here.\n2l First, I want to talk to you about something called\n22 aiding and abeting. For counts Two, Four, and Six, which\n23 we're going to discuss in just a moment, Maxwell is guilty if\n24 she commited those crimes herself, but you can also find her\n25 guilty under an aiding and abeting theory. In other words, if\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 257 2893\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl tea in that schoolgirl outfit and Epstein initiated sexual\n\n2 contact with Kate, later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she\n\n3 had fun. Maxwell told Kate that she was a good girl.\n\n4 Kate also told you about hou Maxwell complained about\n5 Epstein's need to have sex three times a day, hou Maxwell was\n\n6 constantly looking for someone to give him bloujobs. That\n\n7 makes it crystal clear exactly what Maxwell intended when she\n\n8 was taking Jane on these trips. Jane was there to satisfy\n\n9 Epstein's constant need for sexual gratification. The evidence\nlo proves to you that Maxwell is guilty on Count Four.\n\nll Nou let's talk about Count Six, it's sex trafficking\nl2 an individual under age l8. This count is about Carolyn.\n\nl3 The first element is that the defendant knouingly\n\nl4 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or\n\nl5 obtained Carolyn. You heard about hou the defendant called\n\nl6 Carolyn for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments with Epstein. She was\n\nl7 recruiting, enticing, providing, and obtaining Carolyn every\n\nl8 single time she did that.\n\nl9 The second element is that the defendant knew that\n2o Carolyn was under age l8. Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a\nal l4-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again\n22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,\n23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother\n24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just\n25 dropped out of middle school. There just can't be any question\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 257 2894\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl that Maxwell knew Carolyn was underage.\n\n2 And we're talking about the counts one by one, but I\n\n3 want to step back and ask you to keep in mind, you don't have\n\n4 to set aside all of the evidence you heard in this case when\n\na you examine each count, it's the opposite. The patern\n\n6 throughout the case tells you that the defendant knew these\n\n7 girls were under age and she knew that they were going to be\n\n8 molested. You should consider all of that evidence as you\n\n9 examine each count.\n\nlo The third element of Count Six is that the defendant\nll knew Carolyn would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\nl2 And here, a commercial sex act just means a sex act in exchange\nl3 for money. That's what happened to Carolyn. She was paid\n\nl4 hundreds of dollars every time that she was abused. Sometimes\nl5 Maxwell handed over the cash herself.\n\nl6 And we've been talking all morning about the\n\nl7 overwhelming evidence that Maxwell knew these girls would be\n\nl8 sexually abused in those so-called massages. She absolutely\n\nl9 knew.\n2o Finally, there is a fourth element here. In\n2l interstate commerce here means something a litle different\n22 than the first two counts we talked about. We're not talking\n23 about travel across state lines. Instead, we're talking about\n24 an effect on interstate commerce.\n25 So when Carolyn got packages from New York, when she\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017083.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 62 of 257 2895\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl was abused on a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table that was manufactured in\n\n2 California, that proves that there was at least a minimal\n\ni) effect on interstate commerce, which is all that's required for\n4 this count.\n\n5 Finally, there are three conspiracy counts that charge\n6 Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein to commit the three crimes\n7 that we just talked about. I expect Judge Nathan will instruct\n8 you that a conspiracy just means an agreement to break the law.\n9 The crime is the agreement and taking some step to carry it\n\nlo out. So the question for you here is, did Maxwell agree with\nll Epstein to commit these crimes. The conspiracy counts are\n\nl2 counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl3 The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4.\nl4 Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie. Those counts\nl5 charge a conspiracy related to enticement and travel, as we've\nl6 just discussed. We've already talked about hou Maxwell and\n\nl7 Epstein completed these crimes as to Jane. For the conspiracy\nl8 charges, even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused\nl9 in New York, everything about the defendant's and Epstein's\n2o interactions with those girls makes it clear that that is what\n2l they both intended. Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as\n22 part of a broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with\n23 underage girls for abuse. You heard about all of the steps the\n24 defendant took in those years in furtherance of that\n25 conspiracy, hou Maxwell traveled with Jane and groomed Annie\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017084.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 63 of 257 2896\nLCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe\n\nl for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York,\n\n2 hou the defendant asked Carolyn to travel, too. This went on\n\n3 for years.\n\n4 Count Five is the sex trafficking conspiracy count\n\n5 which spans from 2ooo to 2oo4, and this count relates to\n\n6 Carolyn and Virginia. You heard about the steps the defendant\n7 took in those years with Carolyn and Virginia. She was taking\n8 steps to traffic girls for sex, recruiting Virginia Roberts at\n9 Mar-a-Lago, transporting Virginia to other states with Epstein,\nlo sending Carolyn up to the Palm Beach <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room on her first\nll visit, calling Carolyn for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments in Florida so\nl2 that she could engage in commercial sex acts. The defendant\n\nl3 took so many steps in furtherance of the conspiracies charged\nl4 in the indictment, the evidence about that was overwhelming, it\nl5 went on for years.\n\nl6 But let me say this, because it's very important. For\nl7 each of the conspiracy counts, to find the defendant guilty,\n\nl8 you only have to find that she did it once, that there existed\nl9 one moment in time in all of those years where she agreed to do\n2o this, and that Maxwell or Epstein took some step to carry out\n2l the agreement. That's it. If you find that one moment\n22 happened, the defendant is guilty.\n23 Let me say one last thing about the law.

STERNHEIM: And I preface this by saying that I\n\nl3 haven't had an opportunity to research it, but during the\n\nl4 closing argument, Ms. Moe indicated that because a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\n\nl5 table came from California, that affects interstate commerce.\nl6 It is not my understanding that that is accurate. If that were\nl7 the case, then any dwelling that contained any property that\n\nl8 had come out of state would have affected interstate commerce.\nl9 There is no evidence that the table was purchased, when it was\n2o purchased, and whether it was purchased in connection with the\n2l offenses charged. It is unlike the cases where property is\n22 stolen, and that property is for resale and affects interstate\n23 commerce. This is not that situation, and I think that the\n24 statement is incorrect.\n25 THE COURT: Application?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 76 of 257 29o9\nLCKVMAX4\n\nl MS.

I expect that Judge\n24 Nathan is going to instruct you that the government is not\n25 required to use any particular investigative techniques.

But you do have pouerful\n\nl9 corroboration from three different victims who each told you\n2o compellingly similar accounts of their experiences, three\n2l different victims who remember the defendant touching their\n22 breasts, three different victims describing hou the defendant\n23 used <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> as a technique to move into sexual abuse.\n24 And by the way, you do have documents to back up their\n25 testimony.

What do you think stands out in her memory more, who\n2 the pregnant person in that picture was or the middle-aged man\n3 who was masturbating and touching her breasts inside that room?\n4 That is the definition of a peripheral detail.\n\n5 And why is the defense focusing so much on these\n\n6 peripheral details? Because they desperately want you to\n\n7 ignore the fact that Carolyn has consistently remembered\n\n8 Maxwell as one of the people involved in her experiences at\n\n9 that house. They want you to forget that she mentioned Maxwell\nlo not once, but twice in her 2oo9 deposition.

She named\nl3 her as one of the two people she would talk to when she called\nl4 herself begging to come over because she needed the money. And\nl5 Carolyn told Sean that she met a woman named Maxwell, whose\n\nl6 first name she couldn't pronounce.\n\nl7 Nou, back then there was no reason for Carolyn to go\nl8 into more detail about what was happening with Maxwell,\n\nl9 especially not in a lawsuit that was about Sarah and Epstein.\n2o But when she was asked more detailed questions, she remembered\n2l the core events, and she'd already mentioned Maxwell, without\n22 prompting, long before there could be anything to contaminate\n23 her memory.\n24 Next, the defense suggests that somehou these clear\n25 memories of Maxwell got implanted into the brains of Jane and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l75 of 257 3oo9\nLCKCmax7 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl story about the defendant? And it makes no sense for the other\n2 lawyers to push this supposedly made up story about the\n\n3 defendant when they've already goten paid.

The defense suggests that some\n23 lawyers made everything up about Maxwell to get money, but even\n24 if adding Maxwell in to get money could get you money, which is\n25 not true, there is no universe in which that was the case when\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page l8o of 257 3ol4\nLCKVMAX8 Rebutal - Ms. Comey\n\nl Third.

MOE: Your Honor, throughout this case from\n\nl9 opening statements, defense counsel has repeatedly suggested to\n2o the jury that all of the victims in this case were overage,\n2l that nothing improper happened, and suggested to the jury that\n22 no one had an interest in underage girls.\n23 The fact that Jeffrey Epstein had a collection of\n24 schoolgirl outfits alongside the same floor as his <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\n25 room, in the same room where he kept the massager devices that\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018125.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 24 of 236 928\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl probative of his sexual interest in underage girls, which the\n\n2 defense hat put at issue squarely in this case. This evidence\n3 is probative of that question. In particular, the fact that\n\n4 schoolgirl costumes, small ones, were found in the same floor\n\n5 of the house as a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room where an underage girl was\n\n6 sexually abused is certainly probative.\n\n7 THE COURT: It seems to me that that evidence, as you\n8 alluded, Mr. Everdell, so I have my denial of the exclusion of\n9 witness 3. There are 4l2 issues in that, so that is sealed,\n\nlo I'm going to be cautious, but I think it's consistent with what\nll I indicated would be permited as testimony with regard to that\nl2 witness. So, I think the arguments that are being made go as\nl3 to timeframe, go to weight and not admissibility, and I will\n\nl4 overrule the objection.\n\nl5 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I could just make one\n\nl6 request, which is if we're going to let that exhibit be\n\nl7 admited, that it be admited subject to connection and not\n\nl8 shoun to the jurors until we have testimony that relates back\nl9 to a particular victim in this case.\n2o MS. MOE: Your Honor, if the Court would prefer to\n2l either admit that evidence subject to connection or reserve on\n22 that issue, unless and until that witness testifies, we'd have\n23 no objection. Our argument remains the same that it is\n24 probative of his interest in underage girls, separate and apart\n25 from it being corroborative of any witness testimony that may\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8l25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018131.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3o of 236 934\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl understanding is there is going to be several photographs, room\n2 by room, of what that this place looked like. So I don't think\n3 they've established a foundation for these photos, your Honor,\n4 and I don't think they will be able to because I don't think\n\n5 they have another witness who can do it, and I don't think they\n6 should be admited.\n\n7 THE COURT: What are the exhibits numbers?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: It's everything in the 9oo series, your\n9 Honor, minus the ones that are of the exterior, and I don't\n\nlo have those in my mind, but anything in the 9oo series that is\nll an image of the interior.

MOE: Your Honor, as a threshold mater, I think\n2o Mr. Everdell was referring to testimony from Mr. Alessi about\n2l renovations. My understanding is that that testimony was about\n22 renovations in the Florida house and not the New York house.\n23 With respect to the point about a witness identifying\n24 the interior of the house as being consistent during the\n25 timeframe of the charged conspiracy, that witness is Jane.

If I had $loo or $2oo, I will pay in cash, otherwise\n\n9 it was a process of making them sign a piece of paper and make\nlo a receipt, make the check, send a copy of the check back to the\nll office in New York, and that's hou they kept the records.\nl2 Q. Okay. So the process would be someone would give a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nl3 and sometimes they would come doun and say to you, okay, I was\nl4 there for an hour and you would pay them a check for $loo;\nl5 right?\nl6 A.

The exhibits could\n2l corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that\n22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for\n23 a giant <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table in the middle of it.

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020450.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page64 of 9l\n\nll/l9/2o2l | 475 | JOINT LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020994.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel68 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page ll of 45\nminors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 7l4-l9. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’\ntestimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim folloued a\nuniform “playbook.” H.g., id. at 2l84 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.\nShe manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”), 2853 (“The paterns you\nsaw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways\nthat you knou that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities\nin the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities\nbetween what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly pouerful\nevidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you about the playbook that Maxwell ran\nagain and again and again.”), 29ol (“Four women have testified at this trial about Maxwell.\nThey all describe the same woman, the same playbook.”). Carolyn was the only witness who\ntestified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by\nwhat Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and hou she operated for years.”\nId. at 288o; see also id. at 2895-96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a\nbroader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The\nGovernment, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for\na decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.\n\nThe Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired\nto sexually abuse minor victims, their conduct beginning in 2ool evolved from developing one-\non-one relationships with their victims to include a “pyramid scheme of abuse,” by which they\nacquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32\n(quoting Trial Tr. at 4o). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its\nclosing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o994\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020995.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel69 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l2 of 45\na decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 4o; see\nalso, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2ool as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But\na single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a\ndiscontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving\nthe same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l)\n(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d lo7, ll4-l5 (2d Cir. 2ooo)); see\nalso United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. l99o). Notably, the\nGovernment, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the patern of abuse,\nimmediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this\nscheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 4l.\n\nMoreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor\nvictims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its\nbrief. As to both counts, both before and after 2ool, the Government emphasized that <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nwas a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the\nmeans by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.\nCompare id. at 4o (“You will learn that in the l99os, they used the cover of mentoring young\ngirls . .. to introduce <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages\nas a way to sexually abuse the victims.”), with id. at 4l (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,\nthe defendant could just call girls to schedule <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments and hand them cash\nafterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was the primary way\nthe defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”), 2852 (“Again and again throughout\nthis trial, you heard about hou these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey\nEpstein.”).\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o995\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020996.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“[allmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free.... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nIs\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021002.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/6 of 22l\nA-376\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting interstate commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” /d. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. /d. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein.

She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in interstate commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIll.

The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged\nin illegal sexual activity with girls.| OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors commited\nprofessional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein’s crimes before the NPA was\nsigned or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing.\nI. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein\nin 2oo5, after the parents of a l4-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nEpstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and\nother United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used\npersonal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those\nmassages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Atorney’s Office, a\nPalm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July l9, 2oo6, for felony solicitation of\nprostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o7. Houever, because the PBPD Chief and the\nlead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Atorney’s handling of the case and believed that\nthe state grand jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred the\nmater to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal\ninvestigation.\n\nThe FBI brought the mater to an Assistant U.S. Atorney (AUSA), who opened a file with\nher supervisor’s approval and with the knouledge of then U.S. Atorney R. Alexander Acosta.\nShe worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course\nof the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2oo7, the AUSA submited to her\nsupervisors a draft 6o-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a\nlengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and\naddressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges.\n\nFor several weeks follouing submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed\nindictment, the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine hou to proceed. At a\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with Epstein’s atorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if\nEpstein pled guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,\nregistered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain\nmonetary damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications\nwith Epstein’s team of atorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the\nfederal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2oo7.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021213.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O39 3536o38, Page4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and nude on the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. During the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021214.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N4o 3536o38, Page42 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4o of 348\n\nthey found computer monitors and keyboards in the home, as well as disconnected surveillance\ncameras, but the computer equipment itself—including video recordings and other electronic\nstorage media—were gone. Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021219.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OA 3536o38, Page47 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 45 of 348\nEpstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”\nto avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring atorneys who had personal connections to the\nState Atorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset\nof the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely\nemploy. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you knou people are going to be geting\ncalls about .. . you just want to make sure that they knou about it so they don’t get... a call from\nout of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to\nput the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t\nwant to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had\noccurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected\nthe case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s\nresources if the Office would just back doun to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,\nAcosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later\nemail to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and\nSloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal\nprosecution if the U.S. Atorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green\nlight” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.\n\nBoth Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2oo6 meeting with\nVillafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not\npreviously heard of Epstein.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man\nwho was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable mater to pursue”\nfederally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told\nOPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the\nfederal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the\nexploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a\n“oreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have\nexplicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been\nsimply to acknouledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal\ninvestigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein\ninvestigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Atorney’s Office had\n“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,\nSloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the\nState Atorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect\nthe USAO, noting that as of July 2oo6, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically\nconnected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\n22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of\nEpstein. On July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as\na “Manhatan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and\nKevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021235.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON eL 3536o38, Page63 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021287.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3536o38, Pagell5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll3 of 348\nthis mater.” Lourie responded with an assurance that the Reiter notification was only “so he does\nnot find out about it in the paper,” and he concluded: “TI enjoyed it as well. Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\ndifficult negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nTel Villatafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou. Can I persuade you to atend?”\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his cooperation in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021408.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 334 3536o38, Page236 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 348\ninvolved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman then directed her to have the case\nagents make the victim notifications.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia directed the case agents to “meet with the victims to provide them\nwith information regarding the terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”\nThe case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a discussion that Marie and I had as\nto... hou we would tell them, and what we would tell them, and what that was I don’t recall, but\nit was the terms of the agreement.” Villafafia believed that if “victims were properly notified of\nthe terms [of the NPA] that applied to them, regarding their right to seek damages from [Epstein],\nand he paid those damages, that the rest of the [NPA] doesn’t need to be disclosed.” Villafafia\n“anticipated that [the case agents] would be able to inform the victims of the date of the state court\nchange of plea [hearing], but that date had not yet been set by state authorities at the time the first\nvictims were notified [by the FBI].” Villafafia told OPR that it was her belief that because the\nUSAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the\ngeneral public, but victims could be informed “because by its terms they needed to be told what\nthe agreement was about.” Villafafia told OPR that no one in her supervisory chain expressed a\nconcern that if victims learned of the NPA, they would try to prevent Epstein from entering a plea.\n\nWithin a week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that the parties had\nreached a deal to resolve the Epstein case. For example, on October l, 2oo7, the\nNew York Post reported that Epstein “has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes\nat his Florida mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” and noted that\nEpstein would plead guilty in state court and that “the feds have agreed to drop their probe into\npossible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge.”°”!\n\nThe case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and\n“we would not be pursuing this federally.” In October 2oo7, for example, the case agents met with\nvictim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.”\nAccording to the case agent, during that meeting, the case agents told Wild “that an agreement had\nbeen reached, Mr. Epstein was going to plead guilty to two state charges, and there would not be\na federal prosecution.”°°” Houever, in a declaration filed in 2ol5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild\ndescribed the conversation differently:\n\n[T]he agents explained that Epstein was also being charged in State\n\ncourt and may plea [sic] to state charges related to some of his other\n\nvictims.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84).

(Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic\nstress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-\ndren are most frequently sexually abused through\ngrooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.\n(Tr.7l3).

Sexual Abuse of Jane\n\nMaxwell and Epstein met Jane in l994 when she\nwas just l4 years old at a summer camp for talented\nkids. (Tr.29o-94). Jane was particularly vulnerable, as\nher father had just died (a fact that she told both Ep-\nstein and Maxwell), and her family was struggling fi-\nnancially. (Tr.293-94). Maxwell and Epstein cultivated\na relationship with Jane, spending time with her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach home and taking her to the mov-\nies and shopping. (Tr.295-3o2, 348). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein gave Jane gifts, and Jane came to look up to Max-\nwell like an older sister figure. (Tr.298-3ol).\n\nMaxwell and Epstein sexually abused Jane start-\ning when she was l4 years old, and the sexual abuse\ncontinued for years. (Tr.3o6-l5). When Jane was still\nonly l4 years old, Maxwell and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where Max-\nwell and Epstein fondled each other, casually giggling,\nwhile Epstein asked Jane to take her top off.

Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by\nEpstein between the ages of l4 and l6 years old, and\nMaxwell was frequently in the room when the abuse\nhappened. (Tr.3o7-l5). Over time, the abuse escalated,\nas Epstein used vibrators on Jane, put his fingers in\nJane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face.\n(Tr.3l9-2o). Maxwell sometimes touched Jane, includ-\ning on her breasts, during these incidents. (Tr.3ll).\nJane also traveled with Maxwell (who assisted Jane in\nmaking travel arrangements) and Epstein to Epstein’s\ntounhouse in New York City and his ranch in New\nMexico, where she was sexually abused. (Tr.3l6-24).\n\n2. Sexual Abuse of Kate\n\nMaxwell and Epstein’s sexual abuse of Kate started\nin l994, around the same time that Maxwell and Ep-\nstein started sexually abusing Jane. (Tr.ll72, ll79-\n86). After Kate, then l7 years old, told Maxwell that\nshe lived alone with her mother and had a difficult\nhome life, Maxwell introduced Kate to Epstein in Lon-\ndon. (Tr.ll78-82). Maxwell delivered Kate to a naked\nEpstein in Maxwell’s oun home for massages and told\nKate to “have a good time.” (Tr.ll82-89). During these\nmassages, Epstein initiated sexual contact.

But when Annie managed to extricate herself\nfrom the situation by running to the bathroom,\nthereby denying Epstein further sexual contact, Max-\nwell seemed “very disinterested” in Annie for the re-\nmainder of the trip. (Tr.2o86-88).\n\n4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts\n\nBeginning in or about the summer of 2ooo, Max-\nwell and Epstein entered a new phase of their scheme\nto sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Max-\nwell recruited a l7-year-old girl named Virginia Rob-\nerts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Ep-\nstein with massages. (Tr.84o-46). Over the next sev-\neral months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with\nsexualized massages at his Palm Beach residence, in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021670.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page23 of 93\nlo\n\nexchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each mas-\nsage.

Virginia brought other\nteenage girls to Epstein’s Palm Beach house. (Tr.845).\nOne of those girls was a l4-year-old girl named Car-\nolyn who Virginia introduced to Maxwell and Epstein\nat the Palm Beach villa in 2ool. (Tr.l5l8-24).\n\n5. Sexual Abuse of Carolyn\n\nCarolyn met Maxwell the very first time she went\nto Epstein’s house, and she interacted with Maxwell\nmultiple times thereafter. (Tr.l52o-2l). On Carolyn’s\nfirst visit to the house, Maxwell greeted Virginia, who\nintroduced Carolyn to Maxwell. Ud.). Maxwell then\ntold Virginia, “You can bring her upstairs and shou\nher what to do,” after which Virginia shoued Carolyn\nhou to perform a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Epstein. (Tr.l52l-\n23).\n\nThereafter, Carolyn performed over loo paid sexu-\nalized massages for Epstein when she was between l4\nand l8 years old. (Tr.l525). The vast majority involved\nthe same course of abuse through which Epstein mas-\nturbated, touched Carolyn’s breasts and butocks, and\ndirected Carolyn to touch his nipples. (Tr.l545-46).\nEpstein also atempted to touch Carolyn’s vagina with\na vibrator, brought other females into the room to en-\ngage in oral sex with Carolyn, and raped Carolyn by\npenetrating her vagina with his penis. (Tr.l545-47).\n\nAt first, Maxwell personally scheduled Carolyn’s\nappointments with Epstein, including on phone calls\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l67o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021671.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page24 of 93\nll\n\nfrom New York, and sometimes sent a car to pick Car-\nolyn up because she was too young to drive. (Tr.l524,\nl527-32). Maxwell also engaged Carolyn in conversa-\ntions during which Carolyn revealed that she had pre-\nviously been sexually abused by a relative, that her\nparents were separated, and that her mother strug-\ngled with addiction. (Tr.l533-36). Maxwell invited\nCarolyn to travel with Maxwell and Epstein, but Car-\nolyn responded that because she was only l4 years old,\nshe would not be able to get permission to travel.\n(Tr.l534-35). Carolyn was paid several hundred dol-\nlars in one-hundred-dollar bills after each <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>,\nand Carolyn also received gifts of lingerie from Epstein\nand Maxwell shipped from Manhatan to her home in\nFlorida. (Tr.l54o-42). Usually, the money was laid out\non the table or by the sink in the bathroom, but Max-\nwell personally paid Carolyn after a few massages.\n(Tr.l54o-4l).\n\nMaxwell saw Carolyn fully nude in the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nroom on approximately three occasions when Carolyn\nhad already undressed in preparation for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\nbut before Epstein entered the room. (Tr.l536-38). On\none such occasion, when Carolyn was l4 years old,\nMaxwell told Carolyn that she had a nice body and\ntouched Carolyn’s breasts. (d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had\nany young friends she could bring for massages.\n(Tr.l544). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to\nEpstein for sexualized massages, including multiple\nminors. (Tr.l544-46, l753-54).

Melissa went to\nEpstein’s residence to provide Epstein with massages\non multiple occasions when she was under the age of\nl8. Ud.). When Melissa and Carolyn went to the Palm\nBeach house, they remained in the home for about an\nhour and then returned with hundreds of dollars in\ncash. (d.).\n\nB. The Defense Case, Verdict, and Sentencing\n\nMaxwell called nine witnesses in her defense case,\nincluding former employees and associates, as well as\nan expert on memory. (Tr.2327-253l, 2595-2684).\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury found Maxwell\nguilty of Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.\n(A.86).\n\nOn April l, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s\nmotion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 based on a juror’s provision of\ninaccurate information during jury selection, as dis-\ncussed in greater deal in Point III, infra. (A.8l8-57).\nOn April 29, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied all but one of\nMaxwell’s remaining post-trial motions. (A.358-4o2).\nJudge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts\n(Counts One, Three, and Five) were multiplicitous and\nthat she would, therefore, enter judgment on Count\nThree alone among the conspiracy counts.

Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-\nstein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant.\n(A.4l7; see Tr.l39-4o, l89o). Judge Nathan found that\ntestimony credible, in part because it was corroborated\nby other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein’s “num-\nber two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach\nwhere much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen\nworked. (A.4l7). The trial evidence shoued that Kellen\nscheduled sexualized massages and took nude photo-\ngraphs of Carolyn. (PSR 4 66; Tr.l554-55). Even after\nKellen took over some of Maxwell’s duties, Maxwell\ncontinued to manage her by virtue of her position in\nthe house, a fact corroborated by a household manual\ndirecting staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records\nshouing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Ep-\nstein’s planes dozens of times. (A.4l7). The clear infer-\nence from this record is that Maxwell instructed Kel-\nlen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the\npart of the scheme that Maxwell had previously han-\ndled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls to\nschedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions.\nMaxwell argues that Judge Nathan erred because a\ndefense witness testified that she, rather than Kellen,\nwas Maxwell’s assistant. (Br.85). That uncorroborated\ntestimony is not enough to render Judge Nathan’s\nfinding clearly erroneous. Moreover, what maters is\nwhether Maxwell exercised supervisory authority over\nKellen, not whether Kellen or another individual was\nformally Maxwell’s assistant.\n\nMaxwell also argues that when imposing the 24o-\nmonth sentence, which was above the Guidelines\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022358.jpg": "‘ L\nRedactions for personal » 3\ncontact information soviet\neee eben ecb\n- Steels Phi trae eu\n*\npagent ae ESSE NE ORAL : 4 sft ante rons e ae oe\nsa es eam Bee ; ae eu) eae ee\nea SAD ad Seis eve Pipers it RR ee RTE ae ener\neG age oes PROS i ererenataie i ae eas ager paerie Cirewnse [es tmean 3% Hos Bonne\nee ee ey Wace ace +4 i i ae Ree ease\nious ee le ea een ae arenes ee De ee oe Uke\narti Pee ee a ace Betis a cee See ee es me ee ee a\ni\n}\n| <span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span> A - Island _ Elisa -\n! | Evani Duud Efrat :\n. uy ‘ . =\nk ; Git Avi 7\n; tman, Arik Torne di Pisa\nct\nty .\nie Arik Train info\niF J\n| = °\n; Water Taxi JEFFREY (J)\nj ne : Jerusalem Hyat J\ni Danie\n} ee ee\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022376.jpg": "*Redactions for personal ,\ncontact information\n4 a : .\n‘ 5 3 fy ogens, Larry\n- <span class=\"highlight\">Massage</span> - Florida {a)__ { ,\n= x | Dojice PB\nBisse Bom nano Heficopter\ni i. 3 i xwell, Ghislaine ——\n, ‘i’ | RANCH (BH)\nae i AL:\npa *\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022680.jpg": "Page 94 Page 96\nl asking me, I believe started in the 2ooos. l TODD BLANCHE: -- I appreciate.\n2 TODD BLANCHE: In the 2ooo time period? 2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: So then I think -- so\n3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yeah. 2ooo. 3 she -- she takes up with the local drug dealer and\n4 TODD BLANCHE: Why do you-- why do you | 4 — she becomes druggie, druggie.

According to SG’s father, Robson drove a pick up truck.\n\nSG described Epstein's house as a two-story pink house with a Cadillac Escalade parked in the\ndriveway. She recalled that Jeffs house was on a dead end street. Upon arriving at the house SG stated that\nthey walked up a driveway, past what appeared to be a small guard/security room. A male approaching them\nasking what they wanted. Robson stated they were there to see Epstein. The male alloued them to continue\nwalking up to the house. SG stated the man told them that Epstein was not there but was expected back. He\nalloued them to enter the house, via the kitchen. He offered them something to drink while they waited inside.\nShortly thereafter, Epstein and his assistant, described as white female with blond hair and later identified as\nSarah Kellen, entered the kitchen. Epstein introduced himself to SG. SG described Epstein as being\napproximately forty-five years old, having a long face and bushy eyebrous, with graying hair.\n\nRobson and Epstein left the kitchen leaving SG alone in the kitchen. They returned a short time later.\nThey all spoke briefly in the kitchen. SG was instructed to follou Kellen upstairs. SG recalled walking up a\nflight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table in it. Upon entering the room there\nwas a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of\nthe sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of\nnaked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.\n\nEpstein entered the room wearing only a touel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein\nwas stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not knou what to do as she was the only one\nthere in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his touel and told the SG to\ntake off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his touel off, placing it on the floor as he laid\ndoun on the table. SG stated she then removed her pants leaving her thong panties on. Epstein then instructed\nher to give him a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> pointing to a specific lotion for her to use. As SG began to give Epstein the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>,\nhe told her to get on his back.

Before she left, Epstein asked SG to leave her phone\nnumber. As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred\ndollars that day for bringing her.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the\ninvestigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 56l-\n3o8-o282. SG spoke with Robson in an atempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson,\nwhat did she need to do to make more money. Robson stated, “the more you do, the more you get paid.”\nRobson had subsequently called back SG and left a voice mail message for her indicating that she had set up an\n\nappointment for SG to go to Epstein’s house at ll:oo am on April 5, 2oo5. This message was recorded from\nSG’s voice mail.\n\nBased on the above, trash pulls were established at Epstein’s residence with Supervisor Tony Higgins of\nthe Sanitation Bureau of the Toun of Palm Beach. The trash pull from April 5, 2oo5 revealed a telephone\nmessage for Epstein which stated Haley and SG’s name at ll:oo am. This was the time frame Robson had\ninformed SG to be ready to go work at Epstein’s house.\n\nOn October 3, 2oo5, Sgt Frick and I went to Robson’s residence and viewed her vehicle parked in the\ndriveway, a red Dodge Neon.

I began the interview by asking Robson hou she became\nacquainted with Epstein. Robson stated that approximately two years ago, just after she turned l7 years of age,\nshe was approached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach.

While in the home I observed the pink and green couch within the master\nbedroom area just as the girls previously mentioned. The stairway, which is located from the kitchen area to the\nmaster bedroom area, is lined with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked\nyoung females, some of which appeared to be the girls I previously interviewed, were on display throughout the\nhouse. Also located in the house were various phone message books. The telephone message books have a\nduplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message is writen into the book, the top copy is then torn\non the perforated edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls, dates and telephone numbers\nwere on the copy of the messages. I recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been\ninterviewed. The body of the messages were time of the day that they called for confirmation of \"work.\" Other\nnames and telephone numbers were located in which the body of the messages were, \"I have girls for him\" or \"I\nhave 2 girls for him.\" These messages were taken by Sarah Kellen, who signed the botom of the messages.\nDuring the execution of the warrant, I located a Royal Palm Beach High School transcript for AH in Epstein’s\nbedroom desk. This desk had stationary marked Jeffrey E Epstein. I located a wood colored armoire beside\nEpstein’s bed that contained a botle of “Joy Jelly,” which is used to provide a warm <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Several <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>\ntables were located throughout the second floor of the residence, including a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table found in Epstein’s\nbedroom. On the first floor of the residence I found two covert cameras hidden within clocks. One was located\nin the garage and the other located in the library area on a shelf behind Epstein’s desk. A computer was located\nwhich was believed to contain the images from the covert cameras. The computer’s hard drive was reviewed\nwhich shoued several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses that have been interviewed. All of these\nimages appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s desk.\n\nOn December l3, 2oo5, Det. Dawson and I met with ML, dob o2/29/l988.

YL made arrangements to take ML to the house and drove\nML to the house to “work.” They were encountered by a white female with long blond hair. ML was unable to\nremember the name of the white female with blond hair but knew she was Epstein’s assistant. She was led\nupstairs by the white female who explained that there would be lotions out already and Epstein would choose the\nlotion he wanted her to use. She was led through a spiral staircase which led to a master bedroom and\nbathroom. The <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table was already set up in the bathroom.

ML removed her shirt and pulled her pants off. ML stayed in her bra and thong\npanties. As she finished massaging the small of Epstein‘s back, he then turned onto his back. Epstein\ninstructed ML to rub his chest and pinch his nipples. As she began to rub his chest, Epstein asked her questions\nabout herself. ML remembered telling him she atended Royal Palm Beach High School. Epstein asked her if\nshe was sexually active. Before ML could answer, he also asked what sexual position does she enjoy. ML\nstated she was shy and didn’t like talking about those things. She continued rubbing his chest. Epstein reached\nup and unsnapped her bra from the front. ML explained the bra she used had a front snapping device. Epstein\nrubbed her breasts and asked her if she like having her breasts rubbed. ML said “no, I don’t like that.” Epstein\nthen removed his touel and laid on the bed naked exposing his penis to ML. He began touching his penis and\nmasturbated as he touched her breasts. ML explained Epstein then touched her vaginal area by rubbing her\nvagina with his fingers on the outside of her thong panties. ML tensed up and stated Epstein was aware that she\nwas uncomfortable. ML stated that Epstein said to her, “Relax, I’m not going inside.” She further explained\nEpstein commented to her hou beautiful and sexy she was.

CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller\nintroduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the\nconclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a touel. Miller\ninformed CL that they were going to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead\nof modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had\ntold CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did\nnot wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back.\nEpstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples.

Epstein\ncontinued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his touel and paid CL $2oo.oo\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could\nhappen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where\nshe lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for\nCL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who\nprepared the room for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>.

While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age\neighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and\nmade appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein.

It was his responsibility to prepare the house for\nEpstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private\nplane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that touards\nthe end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom.

SG recalled walking up a\nflight of stairs, lined with photographs, to a room that had a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table in it. Upon entering the room there\nwas a large bathroom to the right and a hot pink and green sofa in the room. There was a door on each side of\nthe sofa. SG recalled there being a mural of a naked woman in the room, as well as several photographs of\nnaked women on a shelf. Kellen told the victim that Epstein would be up in a second.\n\nEpstein entered the room wearing only a touel and told SG to take off her clothes. SG stated Epstein\nwas stern when he told her to take off her clothes. SG said she did not knou what to do as she was the only one\nthere in the room so she took off her shirt leaving her bra on. Epstein had removed his touel and told the SG to\ntake off everything. SG stated Epstein was nude when he took his touel off, placing it on the floor as he laid\ndoun on the table.

As SG, Robson and Figueroa were leaving the house, Robson told SG she received two hundred\ndollars that day for bringing her.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, parental consent was granted for SG to assist with the\ninvestigation. At our direction SG conducted controlled taped phone calls to Robson’s cellular telephone 56l-\n3o8-o282. SG spoke with Robson in an atempt to arrange another meeting with Epstein. SG asked Robson,\nwhat did she need to do to make more money.

Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a touel. Miller\ninformed CL that they were going to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead\nof modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had\ntold CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did\nnot wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back.\nEpstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein\nbegan masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein\ncontinued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his touel and paid CL $2oo.oo\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could\nhappen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where\nshe lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for\nCL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who\nprepared the room for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Epstein entered the room wearing only a touel. Epstein had CL remove her\nclothing and provide the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his\nback. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and\ndounward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the\nother hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the touel he was wearing, the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was over. CL was paid\n$2oo.oo for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would\nhappen.

I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that touards\nthe end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked hou young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom.

At the\nconclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a touel. Miller\ninformed CL that they were going to provide a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> on Epstein.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world. But he creates this different\nenvironment. He lives like a pasha. The most magnificent tounhouse I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been in\neverything. I’ve seen a model of the house in Santa Fe ... a stone fortress. A model of the house in the\nCaribbean—it is not to be believed. I’ve seen photographs of the apartment in Parts ... Hou did he gct\nhimself into that pickle? That's the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein. He’s very mysterious. Not that many\npeople get close to bim. Not that many people knou him.”\nThe descriptions of Epstein’s character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at\n‘y varal distance from normal humanity, He lives i what is described as the largest private residence in\n“*onhatan. ahout 5o.ooo square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 7lst.

And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031406.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l5PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 5\n@l/ll/2o88 2l:48 56l6484428 x recats BS\n\nNext: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.\n\nThe lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear hou police connected gray-haired Jeff with\nJeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw\nthemselves into an investigation of the moder and palatial house on El Brillo Way.\n\nPalm Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for touering ficus privacy hedges on\nMediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nne /eibhw printhis.clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acthABeeHie Pa lo=The+Fantacick Pls Recoids, Request Nord Aho\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031407.jpg": "Received: l/l3/o8 3:l6PM; 56l64o442o -> STATE ATTY OFC; Page 6\n8l/ll/2oo8,.2l;48 56l648442 x Page 6 of 9\n\nEpstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was absolutely true. “The\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing\nthe house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view\nseveral masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or\nthree girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The\ngirls that arrived looked young in age.

She was told that\nwhen Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis\nduring his stay in Palm Beach.\nI then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his atorney, Donnie\nMurrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years with\nMr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then\nmoved up into a full time position.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius | wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ...

But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atomey.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has had many massages.” Epstem had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida's\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nl never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating 2 plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\nEpstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzie and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah.” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdiy\n“He lives ina different environment,” says Sicgal. “He's of this world.

Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“It was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a Jitle food out, lovely hors d’oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall T say\nthis? —by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s\ngoing on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> table and left, then Jeff came m,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032064.jpg": "The Fantasist Page 5 of 9\nNext: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.\n\nThe lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear hou police connected gray-haired Jeff with\nJeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw\nthemselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way.\n\nPaim Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for touering ficus privacy hedges on\nMediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032065.jpg": "The Fantasist sae OR\nEpstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge porn is\nmen with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\nHis claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was absolutely true. “The\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein\nwouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like\nyoung women.’ ~ '\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.

Epstein, 53, \"did solicit, induce,\n\n| entice or procure\" prostitution with girls, who were between l4 and l6 years old, on at\n\nleast three occasions between Aug. l, 2oo4, and Oct. 3l, 2oo5.\n\n|\n\n| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,ooo\n\n| bond. His atorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-\n\ndegree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the\n\n| girls were minors.\nThe next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date\nwill be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-\ndegree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,ooo fine.\nA resident of New York, Epstein has ouned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot\nwaterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since l99o.\nThe indictment folloued an ll-lmonth sexual batery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais\nthat began in March 2oo5 alter a Woiun told police tiai der L4-ycui-cis wie podusinci\nmay have been molested by a man in Palm Beach.\nThe investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York\nCity, and on Haley Robson, 2o, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by\nEpstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to\nEpstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor\nRobson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.\nPolice took sworn statements from five alleged victims and l7 witnesses concerning the\nmassages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.\nDuring their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone\nnumbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according\nto police.

But Goldberger said in a prepared\n\n| statement that \"the reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were\nnot charged because the Palm Beach County state atorney's office questioned the\n\n| credibility of the witnesses.\"\nThe statement also said that \"a Palm Beach County jury found the allegations wholly\nunsubstantiated and not credible. Consequently, the grand jury chose not to accuse Mr.\nEpstein of anything beyond the solicitation of a prostitute.\"\nGoldberger also said Epstein passed a lie detector administered by a reputable polygraph\nexaminer, in which he said he was unaware the girls were underage. Moreover, the police\nsearch of Epstein's home turned up no evidence to support the girls' allegations,\nGoldberger said.\nSolicitation of a prostitute is typically a misdemeanor. Epstein was indicted on a third-\ndegree felony solicitation charge applied when there are three or more alleged offenses,\nAfter completing its investigation, Palm Deach police turned the cause over to uisenci’s\noffice several months ago with a probable cause affidavit stating that Epstein should be\navrested on four counts of unlawful sex. acts with 2 vamoerand onc Countul a. aA\nlascivious molestation, all second-degree felonics.\nJanet Kinsella, spokeswoman for Palm Beach police, said the departineit handed the case\nto Krischer only because Epstein was not at his Palm Beach residence.\n\"The normal procedure when you want to arrest a person in another state is to file for an\narrest warrant with the State Atorney's Office, which we did,” Kinsella said.\nBut rather than arresting Epstein on those charges, Krischer's office took the case before\nthe grand jury.\nPolice Chief Michael Reiter was so upset with Krischer's handling of the case that he\nsuggested in a May l memo that Krischer disqualify himself from the case.

Ms Bean identified\nherself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She\nadvised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to\nprovide a <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and\nfelt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was\nbrought to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his\nassistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a\n<span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. I asked her if she provided the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> naked. Bean stated\nshe did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if\nEpstein touched her during the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. She advised he did not,\nhouever he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he\nclimaxed the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> was over. She was paid her money and left the\narea. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to\nEpstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to\nthe lobby.\n\nI located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and atempted to\ncontact her on several occasions. I called 56l-856-26l7 and spoke\nwith Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach\nwhere she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to\nmeet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another\nappointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have\natempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative\nresults.\n\nOn February l3, 2oo6, I met with David Rodgers at 73l8 Heathley Drive\nin Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke\nwith Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since l99l.\nHe flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.\nRodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers\nstated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would\nbe no way of knouing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent\nflight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.\nRodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did\n\n‘remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not\nknou who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger\nmanifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knous by name, Sarah\nand Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male\npassengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.\nMrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her\nhusband consult with an atorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak\nwith the family atorney to inform him of this questioning. I\nexplained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this\ninvestigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers\ncould not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the\narea.\n\n|\nI atempted to locate Britany Beale at 8358 Xanthus Lane in\nWellington. I left my business card for her to return my call.

She remembered she met Epstein and his assistant\nSarah in the kitchen area. She stated she was taken by one of her\nfriends, Kara. She stated she went upstairs with Sarah while Epstein\ngot ready for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>. He exited his bathroom naked and Radabaugh\nturned around. Epstein asked her if being naked offended her.\nRadabaugh stated it made her uncomfortable. Epstein then put ona\ntouel and lay on the table. Radabaugh stated she rubbed his back and\nfeet. She stated she had no <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> training or experience.\nRadabaugh stated during the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span>, Epstein atempted to touch her\nbutocks. Radabaugh pulled away as he touched her butocks. She told\nhim again she was uncomfortable with him touching her. Epstein then\ncut the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> short and became upset with her. Epstein paid her\n$2oo.oo for the <span class=\"highlight\">massage</span> and told her to leave the house. Radabaugh\nnever returned to the house.

The interview was concluded as Radabaugh did not have any\nother information to provide.\nI then learned from the original victim, [JJ§the defense atorney had\nlearned of her identity.
