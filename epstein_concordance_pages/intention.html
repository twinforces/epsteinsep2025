(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001137.jpg": "Cased 2o-€FQd3GouAUNt DibeuMe/ntl $7o 2Fil ed 42SBM/ 26a cedg@s 4l 2o45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001197.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdNt n DUE Gmeolo2o 2A ile@ 42738) 26adeageci A Ob l5\n(Gov.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her.

Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 8 of 45\nThe Proposed Bail Conditions\nMs. Maxwell nou proposes the follouing $28.5 million bail package, which is\nexceptional in its scope and puts at risk everything that Ms. Maxwell has—all of her and her\nspouse’s assets, her family’s livelihood, and the financial security of her closest friends and\nfamily—if she were to flee, which she has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of doing.\n¢ A $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by Ms. Maxwell and her\nspouse, and secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash.\nAs noted in the financial report, the $22.5 million figure represents the value of all of\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets.

Moreover, a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an\nextradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee. See,\ne.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (Judge Keenan found\ndefendant’s extradition appeal waiver “manifests an <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to remain here and face the\ncharges against him”).\n\nIn response to the government’s assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying\nreports of experts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the\nlikelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France,\nwould be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right\nto do so. Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist\nextradition successfully.\n\nUnited Kingdom.

(/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (l) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (i) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (ll) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States; (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that [Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (Ud. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing the country and has relinquished her rights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries.*\n\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2oo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002013.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 4l of 45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention—nou over five months—in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page ll of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\nperson’s intentions and recognizes that the person may legally waive some of the rights\nthat atach to extradition proceedings.\n\n22.

Extradition is authorized by a decree of the French Prime Minister upon the advice of\nthe Minister of Justice.\n\n28. The decree may impose conditions to authorize extradition, such as guarantees not to\nseek or impose the death penalty against the requested person.\n\n29.

The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national.

She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at ll-l3).

(See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account’”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court.

While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2785", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page l8of l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\n26.

The Government was accurate in\nits representation at the July l4, 2o2o initial appearance in this case both that the Government’s\n“investigation remain[ed] ongoing” and that the Government “d[id] not currently anticipate\nseeking a superseding indictment.” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l7 (emphasis added)). Both statements\nwere entirely accurate. At the time of the initial appearance in this case, the Government had not\nyet interviewed Minor Victim-4, so it had no way of anticipating that it would develop evidence\nwarranting a new charging instrument. Houever, both at that appearance and in subsequent\ncommunications with the Court, the Government repeatedly noted that its investigation remained\nongoing, and, more recently, when the Government did have some reason to believe that it might\nbe able to seek a superseding indictment, it signaled as much in its February 26, 2o2l opposition\nto the defense’s pretrial motions.

The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\nidentified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-6o. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the\ncriteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The\ncategorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in\nsetings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a\nprior conviction. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court atempting to examine the facts of the prior\nconviction to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter\nlogistical and constitutional obstacles. /d. (noting an Apprendi problem and “daunting practical\ndifficulties and potential unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant\nfacts will be proved at trial.\n\nThe Weingarten court also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell nou asserts: that\nthe words “offense involving” require a categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used the word\n‘involving’ in § 3283 does not necessarily mean it intended to trigger the categorical approach.\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ooo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003001.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6/7 of 239\n‘Involving’ .. . is equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” 865 F.3d at 6o n.ll\n(citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2oo9) (applying the circumstances-specific approach\nto a statute containing the word “involves”)). Moreover, as the Weingarten court observed, the\nSupreme Court has applied the categorical approach to statutes containing the word “involving”\nwhere the statutes at issue also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”\nin a manner that referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct. 865\nF.3d at 59 (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (l99o); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l\n(2oo4)). By contrast, the phrase “sexual abuse” in Section 3283 refers to specific conduct, and not\nthe statutory offenses charged in the Indictment.\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to\nSection 3283 would run contrary to Congress’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to “cast a wide net to ensnare as many\noffenses against children as possible.” 865 F.3d at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96). On\nthis point, it bears emphasizing that the interpretation the defendant advances would lead to absurd\noutcomes, as many federal crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors do not contain, as an\nelement, a requirement that the defendant commit a sex act with a minor. It would run contrary to\nCongress’s intent to interpret Section 3283 in a manner that would exclude many—if not most—\nsexual offenses against children.\n\nThe lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Countentos, 65l F.3d 8o9\n(8th Cir. 2oll), is easily distinguishable on its facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,\namong other issues, whether the crime of possessing child pornography involved sexual abuse\nwithin the meaning of Section 3283. /d. at 8l6-l8. In analyzing that question, the court discussed,\namong a variety of factors, the elements of the crime.

Indeed, the Second\nCircuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable\nunder Rule l6 or by any means other than the Jencks Act.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out ofrunning for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge?

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003294.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”!4© Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.

Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 348\n\nNotwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2. As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI investigative materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\noo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25l of 348\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28l of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d l2ol, l2l9, l22l (S.D. Fla.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 22\nthus did not decide the issue (and in which Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nnot discussed), and Nader, in which the court incorrectly excluded legislative history from its\nLandgraf analysis. If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper\nweight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did\nnot intend the 2oo3 Amendment to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-\nbarred.\n\n3. The government cannot prevail at step one.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily\ndispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2oo3 Amendment that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit recognized in Weingarten that “there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\namendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 34\n865 F.3d at 6o. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283\nwould be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements\nof the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”’” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3686", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 3o\nApp.-o83l\nca)\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl Your representation sounds right.\n\n2 MR.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nApril l6, 2o2l, which directed the Government to confirm that it has complied with its discovery\nobligations with respect to the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). (Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its discovery and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and\ndisclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\nalso noting what the Government has not done and does not believe it is obligated to do with\nrespect to materials that are potentially related to the NPA.\nB. The Prosecution Team’s Files\n\nAs the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2ol8\nand conducted by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\n(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York\nPolice Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”). (Dkt. No. 63 at l). The\nGovernment has obtained the full investigative file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency\n(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein between 2oo5 and 2olo (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the\ninvestigative file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same\ninvestigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule\nl6 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,\nincluding the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not identified anything\nwithin the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes\nBrady material with respect to the NPA.\n\nC. The Government’s Collection and Review of Other Agencies’ Files\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the Government submited a leter to the Court seting forth its plan\nfor collecting and reviewing certain files from other agencies with potential relevance to this case.\n(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because\nthose other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect\nand review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its\ndisclosure obligations. (/d. at 4). In particular, the Government noted its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to collect: (l)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3957", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004108.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 272 Filed o5/o7/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nForm listed “psych alerts,” which are baseless, and “broad publicity,” which is accurate and\nconcerns risk of harm to Ms. Maxwell via violence, extortion, and feed information to the press\nby other inmates. Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties. Her monitored communication with\nfamily and friends evidences her strong ties in the United States, her strong desire to return to her\nfamily in the United States, and her <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to establish her innocence at her trial in the United\nStates.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4lo8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pageloofl4\nconduct involving Accuser-3 was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy, it argues that it is\nentitled to imply that the conduct itself was unlawful. The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters. The\ngovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4223", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7 of 349\nabuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll9 of 349\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”!4° Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.

Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided .. . Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “‘to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl53 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l24 of 349\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l26 of 349\n\nNotwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2. As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI investigative materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “‘to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\noo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4423", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004475.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l78 of 349\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004528.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23l of 349\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.””*\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4528", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 252 of 349\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.778 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Although\nVillafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, OPR\nlocated no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4567", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 282 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n3o5 Doe v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia.

Ms. Maxwell supported her position with leters from her\nspouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the\ncircumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took\nthese measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to\nharm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to\nflee.\n\nThe Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s\nwife atempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased\nairline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half\nmonths after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court\nalloued the government to introduce this evidence to shou the defendant’s intent to flee and to\nargue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and\nhighlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian\npassport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had\nknoun for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been\ndirectly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the\nflight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he\nhad not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the\nairport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of\nUnited States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. l998) (per curiam), where the court found the\njury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country\none day after the crime was commited.

The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s identification of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is irrelevant. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator.

O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l7 of 43\n\n972 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Concerning number 4 J was less than certain, as\ndemonstrated by her selection of someone else who may have been “Ms. Maxwell.” Factor 5\nalso weighs in Ms. Maxwell’s favor, as the delay was l7 years.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing on this\nmotion and find that the shou up was unduly suggestive and suppress any identification of Ms.\nMaxwell, before or during trial.\n\nVIH. GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO ELICIT LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nOPINION TESTIMONY\n\nThe government agrees that it has not noticed any law enforcement officers as experts\nand, as to their fact police officers, \"will not elicit expert testimony from them.\" Resp. at 82-83.\nOverlooking the long list of potential law enforcement opinion testimony that has been\ndisalloued by Courts in the past (see Mot. at 2-5), the government then goes on to make the\nconfusing claim that the defense should have to \"provide expert\" testimony from the\ngovernment's oun case agents if it wants to call them as witnesses. Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify.

These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial.

(Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def.

O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l7 of 43\n\n972 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” /d. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008849.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document589 _ Filed ol/28/22 Pagellof3\n8oo Third Avenue\nNew York, NY loo22\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP +l2l2 957 76oo phone\nwww.cohengresser.com\nChristian R.

The defense objected to that proposal on the grounds that\nit was unnecessary and overbroad to seal the entire document and that the names of anonymized\nwitnesses could be redacted.\n\nThe defense further objected to Ms. Andriano’s name being redacted in any way due to her\nrecent post-trial interview with the Daily Mail, in which she publicly disclosed her full name and\ndeclared her <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to waive her right to anonymity.

Do you agree with the follouing statement: “Based on my oun experience and without\nknouing the particular facts of any case, if someone claims that they were abused, it is\nmore likely that I will believe they are telling the truth”?\n\n9. Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo. Do you believe that victims would not go through the stress of testifying at trial about\n\nthe sexual abuse they suffered as a child unless they were telling the truth?\nD. Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. Nevertheless, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror. As discussed in the Amicus Brief,\nfame, prestige, and profit are pouerful motivators; and the lure has given rise to the so-called\n2loo689.3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9655", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 52 of 66\nbasis for a cause challenge or a peremptory challenge. Juror No. 5o’s false answers to\nboth questions deprived the Court of any basis for any meaningful inquiry on a topic\nbearing directly on his ability to serve impartially and the basis for a cause challenge. In\naddition, the failure to be truthful on both questions cannot be purely accidental; rather, it\nsuggests the juror’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to shield disqualifying information to advance a desire to\nserve, which he has nou exploited for self-promotion. !°\n\nWe knou, moreover, that Juror No. 5o gave at least one other false answer during\nvoir dire. He falsely said he only used Facebook and Instagram, and he did not mention\nTwiter, despite being specifically asked about it. He also said that he deleted his social\nmedia accounts. That was not true since, as we nou knou, he used Twiter to publicize\nhis interviews with the press and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer and then\nposted on Instagram about his service as a juror.\n\nTruthful answers from Juror No. 5o would have led the Court and the parties to\nprobe much more deeply into his biases and prejudices, both knoun and unknoun.'’ Had\nthat happened, the record shous that he would have been removed as a potential juror.\n\n‘6 Juror No. 5o continues his media exploits despite being the subject of this\nMotion and represented by counsel.

Nathan\nUnited States District Judge\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nMay 2, 2o22\nTo Honorable Judge Nathan:\nMy name is Christine Malina Maxwell. | am one of Ghislaine’s sisters. I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\ninternational scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Page/7of2l\n\nSo too, one of the victim witnesses present at trial was not a minor under the law of the place\nwhere she was abused. Nonetheless, the Court alloued her to testify with a limiting instruction.\nMaxwell’s offense conduct was not limited to minor victims.\n\nSarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an in—court statement at Maxwell’s sentencing.\nThe CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to be “reasonably heard at any public proceeding in\nthe district court involving...sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right of any victim to\ngive what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally United States v,\nDegenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to\nbe reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in—court statement. As one court\nexplained: “At a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to the judge. Read\nagainst this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally with the\ndefendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless stranger.” /d. at\nl348, quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8, 825 (l99l). The Ninth Circuit has reached an\nidentical conclusion. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal. 435 F.3d loll, lol7-l8 (9th Cir.\n2oo6). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Kyl\nexplained, “the very purpose of this section is to allou the victim to appear personally and directly\naddress the court.” l5o CONG. REC. Slo, 9ll (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2oo4) (statement of Sen. Kyl),\nquoted in Degenhardt, 4o5 FSupp.2d at l346.\n\nFurther, victim impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct because an “assessment of\nthe harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate\npunishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo698", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011129.jpg": "Caedast: 2@2OrocRRsP AGN Demwmesnitase Arieelinyo27l PdtpgePafdie3 l4\nL9LSberl\n\nl of my questions in a leading way, I will hope to enforce that\n\n2 line.

F.R.E. lo6, the Rule of Completeness,\nallous that “[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party\nmay require the introduction, at that time, of any other part--or any other writing or recorded\nstatement--that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”\nFederal Rule of Evidence 6l2 is also applicable here and states:\n(a) Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness\nuses a writing to refresh memory:\n(l) while testifying; or\n(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to\nhave those options.\n(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Mater. Unless l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to\nhave the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the\nwitness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the\nwitness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes\nunrelated mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\nunrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if\nthe prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the\nwitness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial.\nThe witness has admited using the journal to refresh her memory. Title l8 of U.S. Code\n§ 35oo is inapplicable here by its very terms because the remainder of the journal is, admitedly,\nnot in the possession of the government. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) (applies exclusively to\nstatements “in the possession of the United States”); see also United States v.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019842.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-l, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel4 of 3l\nmotions are pending and raise significant legal bars to the prosecution\nof this mater.\n\nC.

With respect to the United Kingdom, submited herewith is a report\nfrom David Perry (“Perry Rep.”), a U.K. barrister who is widely considered one of the United\nKingdom’s preeminent extradition practitioners.

Mr. Perry has acted on behalf of many overseas governments in extradition proceedings; has\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020049.jpg": "Caesast:2o-O8oo8BoHAEN ASSL UMENT/ON2 Filec6aAsA/PagPage sb267o45\n\nMr. Julie opines that the French entity with jurisdiction over the legality of extradition\nrequests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell’s extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen,\nand that it is “highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree” against her. (/d. at 2). Mr. Julie bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.\nMaxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ll) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to\nthe United States; (i) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France\nin violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite\nwould obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old\nconduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s\ndiplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.\nJulie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the\nrequesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is\ngenerally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition\nproceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.\nMaxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail\nterms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at l2).\n\nMs. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to\ncontest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the\nallegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee\nafter being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited\nexpeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no\nweight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®\n* Ms. Maxwell would also have very litle incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French\nauthorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020055.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISSCUMENT D2 Fileebka3A/ Pag Page afL26lo45\nll-l2). Ms. Maxwell is not obligated to rebut every theoretical possibility that the government\nmight raise that may contribute to a potential flight risk in order to be granted bail. That is not\nthe standard. Cf United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 892-93 (8th Cir. l985) (“The\nlegal standard required by the |Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable assurances, not absolute\nguarantees.”). Ms. Maxwell has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of fleeing. If she did, then under the proposed bail\nconditions she would lose everything and destroy the family she has been fighting so hard to\nprotect since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell will not do that, and should be granted bail.\n\nG. The Alternative to Bail Is Confinement Under Oppressive Conditions\n\nthat Impact Ms. Maxwell’s Health and Ability to Prepare Her Defense\n\nGranting bail to Ms. Maxwell is all the more appropriate and necessary because the past\nfew months have shoun that Ms. Maxwell cannot adequately participate in her defense and\nprepare for trial from the inside the MDC. The alternative to release is her continued\nconfinement under extraordinarily onerous conditions that are not only unjust and punitive, but\nalso meaningfully impair Ms. Maxwell’s ability to review the voluminous discovery produced by\nthe government and to communicate effectively with counsel to prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has spent the entirety of her detention nou over five months in de facto\nsolitary confinement, under conditions that rival those used at USP Florence ADMAX to\nsupervise the most dangerous inmates in the federal system and are tantamount to imprisonment\nas a defendant convicted of capital murder and incarcerated on death rou. In fact, multiple\nwardens and interim wardens have remarked that in their collective years of experience they\nhave never seen anything like her current regime. The restrictive regulations to which Ms.\nMaxwell is subjected are not reasonably related to a legitimate goal to ensure the security of Ms.\nMaxwell or the MDC. Instead, it seems clear that the overly restrictive conditions are an\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo55", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020115.jpg": "Caseeb2e-cre6o88GlAUNnt Decne lo8 2 FileG6R2/23/2t gPagetl 2osf l5\n(Gov. Mem. at 2o). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing\na pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding\nand somehou forecast Ms. Maxwell’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to flee. V/d.). These arguments are just further\nevidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible\nlight. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne\nout of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats.\nMoreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the\nmeasures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would\nthen willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she\nremained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case.\n\nD. Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly\n\nUnlikely\n\nThe government dismisses Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to waive her extradition rights as\nto France and the United Kingdom as “meaningless” because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee\nwith absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at l4). The\ngovernment misses the point: Ms. Maxwell’s willingness to do everything she can to eliminate\nher ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment\nto remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell’s French and U.K.\nexperts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver\nas part of any extradition request.\n\nIn an atempt to counter William Julie’s expert report stating it is “highly unlikely” that\nthe French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the\ngovernment ataches a leter from the French Ministry of Justice ““MOJ’”) that references neither\nMr. Julie’s report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure “absolutely prohibits” the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020152.jpg": "CaSesb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN ZetuMhent /LOO l FileasaesFaigePage Pat 9\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third\nMotion for Release on Bail.\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States\nfor 3o years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.\nShe wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court\ndeems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the\n25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to\nour knouledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her\nappearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. lo6), Ms.\nMaxwell nou proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily\nrestrictive bail package she has already offered.\n\ne First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate\nany opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.\n\ne Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds\nearmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to\ndefend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and\nfor taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal\nDistrict Court judge and former United States Atorney who will function as asset\nmonitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.\n\nThe former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed\ninsufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to\nseek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom.

(See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application.

Ud. § ll).\nThe provisions on which the government relies were not intended to apply in cases where the\nperson whose extradition is sought had lost French citizenship. To the contrary, it was\ndesigned to apply to individuals who had acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime “in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of\noffenders seeking to escape extradition.” (Ud. 4§ l5-l6). Ifthe person is no longer a French\nnational at the time of the request, the provision does not apply. The government cites no case\nwhere the relevant statute was applied to protect a formerly French national from extradition,\nand we have found none ourselves. (/d. {] l9-2l). By contrast, there are numerous examples\nof French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality follouing the\ncommission of an offense. (/d. 4 2l). Accordingly, Mr. Julie concludes: “[I]t cannot have been\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of French lawmakers that Article 696-4 be construed as meaning that a person\nwho has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from extradition.” (/d.\n\n4] 26).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s agreement to give up both British and French citizenship and waive\nany and all right to contest extradition is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.\nMaxwell would likely flee if released from custody and goes above and beyond the\n“reasonable assurances” that the Bail Reform Act requires to grant bail. While we\nmaintain that Ms. Maxwell’s writen waivers of the right to challenge extradition should\nsuffice, her willingness to forfeit citizenship birthrights exceeds what is necessary and\nprofoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide by conditions of release and appear at\ntrial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol77", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020190.jpg": "CaSedeZotepQo33o4AUNt BisCu trent l7o2 lFiteb 83228 /2 49 Flagecid 65 l8\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW\n26.

Of course she took measures to\nprotect herself and her family, just as government lawyers and judges do\nwhen their safety is at issue. Ms. Maxwell was at her home in the United\nStates. The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such\nconfidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated\nher arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary\ndemonstrative aids. And it is worth repeating that the Government does\nnot claim that Ms. Maxwell — a 59-year old woman with no prior criminal\nhistory — is a danger to the community.

Ironically, it is the MDC staff who leaked to the press that Ms. Maxwell had\nbeen vaccinated.\n\nFurther, in her desire to interact and be helpful with other inmates, Ms. Maxwell\ncompleted two programs to assist other inmates- (l) to qualify as a teacher aide and offered to\nhelp update MDC learning curriculum and (2) to qualify as companion for suicide watch. Her\nde facto solitary confinement prevents her from utilizing that training to assist others.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s segregation and surveillance go way beyond the concerns posited by the\nMDC. It is not only other inmates who may harm Ms. Maxwell, but also the very guards tasked\nto her security detail who have already done harm to her: failing to provide adequate food or feed\nher at all in a 2o-hour period, damaging her discovery hard drive, seizing her confidential legal\ndocuments, erasing her CorrLinks emails, physically abusing her. The list goes on and on. In an\neffort to advocate in compliance with BOP procedure, she has filed hundreds of BP-8s, BP-9s\nand BP-los only to receive a response that is less than helpful, or in the absence of any response\nwas told the form was either lost or never filed, Each and every day of her detention, she is\nguarded by at least three officers who watch and record, by writing and via a handheld camera,\nher every move: when she eats, shouers, cleans her clothes, brushes her teeth, etc. As the guards\nfeverishly write while observing Ms. Maxwell during videoconferencing with counsel, it appears\nthat they go beyond their routine continual l5-minute reporting.\n\nFurther, her non-legal phone calls are monitored in real time. It was the staff who\nconfronted Ms. Maxwell about the death of someone whom she was close to within hours on her\nlearning about it, information derived from her phone calls. Ms. Maxwell does not discuss\npersonal maters with MDC guards and did not provide information concerning the passing of\nsomeone quite dear to her. It was psychological services who confronted her regarding that\ninformation, which could only have been obtained through telephone surveillance. We invite the\nCourt and government to review the calls which contradict the unsupported allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell is a flight risk and support her family strong ties.

It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some\nadditional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least,\nwhen the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not\njustify seting aside the statute’s language and apparent purpose.\n\nMaxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 2o9 (l953), to urge this\nCourt to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended\nthe limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that\ncase, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing\nwas not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as\nrequired by the statute. /d. at 22l. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential ingredient.” /d. at 222. It reached that\nconclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress\nintended it to apply only to a narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. /d. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the\nenacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In passing recent statutes\nrelated to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress\n‘evinced a general <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to “‘cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.””” Jd. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at l96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597\nF.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges’ holding—\nlegislative history supporting a narrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the\nstatute’s plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020849.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page23 of 22l\nA-223\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page l of 7\n8oo Third Avenue\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP PIER welche\n+ vo/ #oo phone\nChristian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to request that the Court give the jury additional\ninstructions to correct apparent errors in the jury’s understanding of Counts Two and Four, and the\nlaw applicable to those counts, that were highlighted by the jury’s note this afternoon (Court\nExhibit #l5).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 reads, in relevant part, as follous:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), [l]f the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nCount Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported from Florida\nto New York, New York on multiple occasions with the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> that [Jane] would engage in one\nor more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.” S82\nInd. ¥ 2l (emphasis added).\n\nIn response to the note, the Court referred the jury to Instruction No. 2l of the jury charge.\nThe defense believes that the Court’s response was erroneous for two reasons.\n\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020851.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Page25 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 566 Filed l2/28/2l Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 27, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nIn contrast to a constructive amendment, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.” Jd. at 2o (cleaned up).\n\nCourt Exhibit #l5 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction on the substantive\ntransportation offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New\nMexico and sexual activity that purportedly took place while she was there. That is not what the\nindictment alleges. Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported.\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” $2 Ind. | 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law. That excludes any conduct that may have occurred in New Mexico.\nIndeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #l5, the government stressed this point:\n\nThe only illegal sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a\n\nstatute in New York. There cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This\n\nparticular charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as well. The\n\njury has not been charged about any laws in New Mexico; so there can’t be any\n\nrisk of confusion for exactly that reason.\n\nTr. 3l4o:lo-l6 (emphasis added).\n2o68538.l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o85l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021011.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel85 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 28 of 45\npart of the same “set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the indictment,” not a\npreviously unidentified and independent theory of guilt.

(“$3286(b)’s use of the terms ‘foreseeable’\nand ‘commission of such offense’ ... dictate a case-specific approach.”’).\n\nIt is noteworthy that the District Court could not identify a single page of\nlegislative history supporting its expansive interpretation of § 3283. But that did\nnot deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when\nCongress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to cast\na wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” Al44. This\nquestionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d l86, l96 (3d Cir. 2ol5), which itself quotes an Eleventh\nCircuit case, United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347, l355 (llth Cir. 2olo).\nDodge, houever, had nothing to do with § 3283. Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different\nstatute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283. Worse still, the full\nquote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.\nSee Dodge, 597 F.3d at l355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our\nconclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against\nchildren as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by\nextension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative\nhistory for § 3283 that does not exist.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge?

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021292.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TIS 3536o38, Pagel2o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll8 of 348\n\nOn October 22, 2oo7, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkouitz had raised, rejecting some\ndefense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy\nyour concern.”'*° Noting that the addendum and a revised leter to the special master were\natached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded.

Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law.

We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l292", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021296.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Pagel24 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\n\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Under this\nAgreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for\nenumerated sections of Title l8 in favor of prosecution by the State\nof Florida, provided ... Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal\ninterests: (l) that Mr. Epstein plead guilty to a “registerable”\noffense; (2) that this plea include a binding recommendation for a\nsufficient term of imprisonment; and (3) that the Agreement not\nharm the interests of his victims.\n\nAcosta explained in the leter that the USAO’s intent was “to place the identified victims\nin the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more;\nno less.” Acosta documented the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255\nl83 The USAO may have been asked to respond because Starr’s leter raised issues that had not been previously\nraised with the USAO, and it would normally fall to the USAO to address them in the first instance.\n\n96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021297.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel25 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement difficult, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021299.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONS 3536o38, Pagel27 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 348\n\nNotwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2.

In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\n99\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l299", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021351.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel79 of 258\nSA-l77\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l77 of 348\n\n[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\n\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021404.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33o 3536o38, Page232 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23o of 348\n2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.”** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”?*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“ig something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.?”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafafia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n288 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n22o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021425.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3EL 3536o38, Page253 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25l of 348\nin FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild.

If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were atrial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”*°\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice... she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin fail?\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*°*> Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n335 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n336 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.””?*°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, ‘“‘[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]Juidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l445", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021457.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page27 of 2l7\nSA-28l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28l of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat ‘“[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”3?°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements. OPR also evaluated representations Villafafia made to victims in\nJanuary and February 2oo8, and to an atorney for a victim in June 2oo8.\n\nI. THE SUBJECTS DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE\nVICTIMS\nDuring the CVRA litigation, the government acknouledged that the USAO did not consult\n\nwith victims about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA. In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\nane Doe v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components.

Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\nOT\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.jpg": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafania of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions’”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl5 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023137.jpg": "Notwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2. As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI investigative materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.'°® The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\n99\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.jpg": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.*”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2s The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.jpg": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023242.jpg": "2. Villafafia Asserts That Her Supervisors Gave Instructions Not to\nConsult Victims about the Plea Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do\nNot Currently Recall Such Instructions\nVillafafia told OPR that during an “early” meeting with Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel,\nwhich took place when “we were probably just entering into plea negotiations,” she raised the\ngovernment’s obligation to confer with victims.7** Initially, Villafafia told OPR she was\ninstructed, “Don’t talk to [the victims]. Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential. You can’t disclose them.”7*?\nVillafafia remained uncertain who gave her this instruction, but believed it may have been Acosta.\nNeither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled a meeting at which Villafafia was directed\nnot to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.””°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n282 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.jpg": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n385 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\nA88 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were\nvalid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is\na case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously\nprepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [Vvictim].”\n\nOver the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the\nprovisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “atach\nbefore the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that\n(l) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a\nnon-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the\nstatute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the seting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;\n(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal\ninvestigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes commited by Epstein render\nthe Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable\ndefense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not\ndispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court\nconcluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners\nthat it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-\nNPA leters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the\nvictims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material\nomission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an\ninvestigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?°°\n\nThe court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the\ngovernment’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea\nagreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is\nentered into without notice, the mater is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard\nregarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure\nto communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with\nEpstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with\nthe Court.”\n\nAlthough the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2oo5 Guidelines for the\nDepartment’s position that CVRA rights do not atach until after a defendant is charged, the court\nwas “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold\ninformation about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on\n386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of\nEpstein’s state court plea hearing.\n\n243\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2328l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023293.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\nIn addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by means of\n\nthe NPA, public and media atention also focused on the government’s treatment of victims. In\n\nthe CVRA litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not\ninformed about the government’s <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to end its investigation of Epstein because the\ngovernment did not consult with victims before the NPA was signed; did not inform them of\n\nEpstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing, thereby denying them the opportunity to atend; and\n\nactively misled them through statements that the federal investigation was ongoing. The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”?”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements.

In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n395 Doe v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023385.jpg": "The Psychology Department conducts a clinical visit with Epstein, who\ndenies any suicidal ideation.\n\nAugust l, 2ol9 MCC New York Receiving and Discharge staff notify the Psychology\nDepartment of the notation of “suicidal tendencies” on U.S. Marshals\nService paperwork relating to Epstein.

She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys.

During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive.

The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied\nsuicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding\nadditional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The\nChief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follou-up and that Epstein\nwould be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.\nAccording to the BOP After Action Review submited by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief\nPsychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July l6, 2ol9, at Epstein’s request during his atorney conference was\ninappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein atempted to “bring his\natorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the\nAfter Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide\npsychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet\nwith an inmate’s atorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.\nOn July l8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was\nunavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would atempt to interview Epstein in the near\nfuture to complete his monthly review.\nAs noted previously, at approximately l:27 a.m. on July 23, 2ol9, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his\ncell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general\nadministrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately\n2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely\nhanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant l assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in\nBOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein\ndid not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not knou\nwhat had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant l noted that Epstein\nhad a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-\nthirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one\nsection of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no\ninflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was\nable to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory\nproblems. Physician Assistant l further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s\nleft knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant l’s assessment was\nthat the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.\n78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s atorneys were not “mocking” her;\nthe atorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and\ndismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.\n\n44\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023412.jpg": "Also on July 23, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment that included a clinical\ninterview of Epstein and a review of Epstein’s medical record, the psychology data system, and a review of\nthe SENTRY database. According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knouing why he was\nplaced on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled geting a drink of water the night prior and\nthen went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment\nrecords reflect that Epstein wanted to knou why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had\nbeen found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had\nplaced the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm\nthoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide atempts; and denied\nfeeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and\nthat his future plans included fighting his criminal case and geting back to his normal life. The Staff\nPsychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cellmate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023414.jpg": "his personally ouned medical device.

According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate's\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate's\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU.

Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress.

She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein.

(See probable cause\naffidavit at page l8). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that “on\nthe first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras\nhidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the\nlibrary area behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was\nreviewed which shoued several images of J and other witnesses\ninterviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera\npositioned behind Epstein’s desk”. (/d.) Omited from the Police Report and\nthe probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had knoun since 2oo3\nabout the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their installation.\nThe cameras were installed in 2oo3 after Epstein discovered that large sums of\ncash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras\ninstalled at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided\nequipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the\nequipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose\nand captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from\nEpstein’s briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of\nAlessi was turned over to the PBPD — indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The\ncharacterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as\nplaying a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein’s home (even though\nnone of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever\nplaced any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading\nand suggests an <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.\n\n4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash. The Police Report details police\nfinding in Epstein’s trash what is described as pieces of “sex toys” and that\nthese “discoveries” purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omited from\nboth the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during\nthe course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the police\nrealized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.\nThough the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable\ncause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery\nof this new and highly relevant evidence.\n\n5. Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other\nexculpatory and impeaching evidence knoun by the PBPD was omited from\nthe Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating\nthe date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police\nReport (at page 85), Det. Recarey “explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the\nPBPD had concluded its case in December of 2oo5”. That assertion, which is\nfalse, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced\nsubsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains\ninformation obtained after December 2oo5, the PBPD escaped having to\nconsider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit,\nor what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence\npresented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December\n2oo5. That evidence is listed belou.\n\n3 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000129.tif": "66a\n\nan alternative basis for its holding, it explained that\nthe offense did not require fraud as an “essential\ningredient.” Jd. at 222. It reached that conclusion in\nlarge part because the statute’s legislative history\nmade clear that Congress intended it to apply only to\na narrou class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss.\nId. at 2l6.\n\nAs the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten,\nCongress had the opposite intent in the enacting in the\nPROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. lo. “In\npassing recent statutes related to child sex abuse,\nincluding extensions of the § 3283 limitations period,\nCongress ‘evinced a general <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to “cast a wide\nnet to ensnare as many offenses against children as\npossible.”” Id. at 6o (quoting Schneider, 8ol F.3d at\nl96 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d l347,\nl355 (llth Cir. 2olo) (en banc))). The primary basis for\nBridges’ holding— legislative history supporting a\nnarrou interpretation—does not exist here. Instead,\nboth the statute’s plan meaning and its legislative\nhistory suggest it should apply more broadly.\n\nBased on the statute’s text, context, and history,\nthe Court follous Weingarten and concludes that the\nappropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses\ninvolved the sexual abuse of a minor on the facts\nalleged in this case. There is no question that they did.\nThe Court thus concludes that § 3283 governs the\nlimitations period for the charges here.\n\n2. The 2oo3 amendment to the statute of\nlimitations applies to these offenses\n\nMaxwell next contends that because the charged\nconduct took place before the PROTECT Act’s enactment,\nthat statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations\napplicable to her alleged offenses.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.4\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.

Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more difficult.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions’”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl4 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl5 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l36", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023137.tif": "Notwithstanding these voluminous submissions, Lefkouitz added that Epstein\n“unconditionally re-asserts his <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to fulfill and not seek to withdraw from or unwind” the\nNPA.\n\n2. As a Result of the Starr and Lefkouitz Submissions, the New USAO\nCriminal Chief Begins a Full Review of the Evidence, and Acosta\nAgrees to Meet Again with Defense Counsel\n\nAfter reviewing Starr’s and Lefkouitz’s leters, Sloman notified Villafafia that “in light of\nthe recent Kirkland & Ellis correspondence” he had asked Robert Senior, who had succeeded\nMenchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, to review de novo the evidence underlying\nthe proposed revised indictment, and Sloman asked Villafafia to provide Senior with all the state\nand FBI investigative materials.\n\nIn the meantime, Acosta agreed to meet with Starr and other Epstein defense atorneys to\ndiscuss the defense complaints raised in Lefkouitz’s December ll, 2oo7 submissions.!°° The\nmeeting took place in Miami on December l4, 2oo7. The defense team included Starr,\nDershouitz, Lefcourt, and Boston atorney Martin Weinberg. The USAO side included Acosta,\nSloman, Villafafia, and another senior AUSA, with the Miami FBI Special Agent in Charge and\nAssistant Special Agent in Charge also present. In addition to previously raised arguments, during\nthis meeting, Epstein’s atorneys raised a new argument—that the state charge to which Epstein\nhad agreed to plead guilty did not apply to the facts of the case.\n\n3. The Defense Notifies Acosta That It May Pursue a Department Review\nof the USAO’s Actions\n\nShortly after the December l4, 2oo7 meeting, Lefkouitz notified Acosta that if the issues\nraised at the meeting could not be resolved promptly, the defense team may “have no alternative\nbut to seek review in Washington.” Acosta notified Assistant Atorney General Fisher that the\ndefense team might make an appeal to her, and he asked her to grant such a request for review and\n“to in fact review this case in an expedited manner [in order] to preserve the January 4th plea date.”\nStarr and Lefkouitz then sent to Acosta a lengthy leter, with numerous previously submited\ndefense submissions, reviewing issues discussed at the meeting, and advising that Epstein sought\na “prompt, independent, expedited review” of the evidence by “you or someone you trust.” The\nleter reiterated Epstein’s position that his conduct did not amount to a registrable offense under\nstate law or a violation of federal law, and with respect to the NPA’s § 2255 provision, that it was\n“improper” to require Epstein to pay damages “to individuals who do nothing but simply assert a\nclaim” under the statute.\n\nl56 As Assistant Atorney General Fisher’s Chief of Staff, Lourie had informed Starr that Fisher hoped Starr\nwould speak to Acosta to “resolve the[] fairly narrou issues” raised in Starr’s correspondence with Acosta. Acosta\nhad the Starr and Lefkouitz submissions of December ll forwarded to Fisher.\n99\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l37", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023189.tif": "[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to\ndescribe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.\nIt was not as legally complex as they made it out to be.

And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.’”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.tif": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023242.tif": "2.

Don’t tell them what’s happening,” but she was not told\nwhy she should not speak to the victims, and she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In\na subsequent OPR interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the issue of notification\nduring the meeting, she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.

Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view\n“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused\non at least at this time,” and he did not “recall discussions about victim notification until after the\nNPA was signed.” Sloman also told OPR that he did not recall a meeting at which victim\nnotification was discussed. Menchel wrote in his response to OPR, “I have no recollection of any\ndiscussions or decisions regarding whether the USAO should notify victims of its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter\ninto a pre-charge disposition of the Epstein mater.” Furthermore, Menchel told OPR he could not\nthink of a reason why the issue of victim notification would have arisen before he left the USAO,\nbecause “we were way off from finalizing or having anything even close to a deal,” and it would\nhave been “premature” to consider notification.7”°\n3. September 6, 2oo7: Villafaia Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,\nof Oosterban’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was\nRequired\nOn September 6, 2oo7, in a lengthy email to Sloman responding to his question about the\ngovernment’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim consultation issue,\nadvising that, “the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as\n[CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law” and that “the [PBPD]\n288 Villafafia could not recall the specific date of the meeting, but Menchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7.\n289 Villafafia also recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations could cause\nvictims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.”\n29o In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated his contention that Villafafia’s claim\nabout a meeting involving Menchel in which she was instructed not to consult with victims was inaccurate and\ninconsistent with other evidence. OPR carefully considered the comments but did not conclude that the evidence to\nwhich Menchel’s atorney pointed necessarily refuted Villafafia’s assertion that she had received an instruction from\na supervisor not to inform victims about the plea negotiations. Houever, it is also true that OPR did not find any\nreference in the emails and other documents dated before the NPA was signed to a meeting at which victim\nconsultation was discussed or to a specific instruction not to consult with the victims. This is one of several events\nabout which Menchel and Villafafia disagreed, but given OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not require\nprosecutors to consult with victims before charges were brought, OPR does not reach a conclusion regarding the\nalleged meeting and instruction.\n2o4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23242", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.tif": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild.

The district\n\ncourt overseeing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government violated the Crime Victims’\n\nRights Act and “‘misl[ed] the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and\n\nthat “[i]t was a material omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have\n\npatience relative to an investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*”°\n\nThe government’s conduct, which involved both FBI and USAO actions, led to allegations that\n\nthe prosecutors had purposefully failed to inform victims of the NPA to prevent victims from\n\ncomplaining publicly or in state court.\n\nOPR examined the government’s course of conduct when interacting with the victims,\nincluding the lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed; Acosta’s decision\nto defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of Epstein’s state plea; and the decision\nto delay informing victims about the NPA until after Epstein entered his plea on June 3o, 2oo8.\nOPR considered whether leters sent to victims by the FBI after the NPA was signed contained\nfalse or misleading statements.

In its February 2l, 2ol9\n\nopinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about\n\nits <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” OPR considered this\nfinding as part of its investigation into the USAO’s handling of the Epstein case, and examined\nwhether, before the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, federal prosecutors were obligated\nto consult with victims under the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject atorneys—Acosta,\n\nSloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia—intentionally violated or recklessly disregarded that\n\nobligation.\n\n395 Doe v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.tif": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components.

The Staff\nPsychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.\nThe Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (l) Epstein\nand/or Inmate l were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not geting;\n(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate l had assaulted Epstein. The\nChief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate\nhe originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate l) was\nless plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not knou for certain.\nThe follouing day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately l:o8 p.m., and observed that the\ncentral part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still\ndid not want to talk about hou he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to\ndo with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether\nEpstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.\nOn July 24, 2ol9, after 3l hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained\nin the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 3o,\n2ol9.7? Also on July 24, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to\nForensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding hou he sustained\nthe scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,\nintentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was\nassessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2\ninquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying\nto remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had\ntried to kill him but was nou claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic\nPsychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cell mate tying a string or rope around his neck.\nFollouing Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from\nsuicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein doun to\npsychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both\n22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU\non July 3o, 2ol9; houever, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2ol9.\n\n45\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023414.tif": "his personally ouned medical device. BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to\nthe SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns. Epstein\nasked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and\nthen return to the SHU with a cellmate the follouing day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist\ninformed Epstein that he could stay l more night and explained that there were no mental health issues\nprecluding him from returning to the SHU the follouing day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein\nthat he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions\nand psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat\nreceptive but more concerned with geting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept\nwell, and Epstein discussed hou he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the\nnoise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed\nEpstein had eaten and taken a shouer the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 3o. The\nStaff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content\nand denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to\nimmediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-\noriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact\nreport that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein\nwould be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein\nabout routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that\nEpstein would be seen the follouing day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if\nneeded. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein\nneeded to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.\nAlso on July 3o, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being\nable to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,\nspecifically tatooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2ol9. In conducting the\nevaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the\nChief Psychologist on July 9, 2ol9, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and\nhaving any past or present suicidal ideation, <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the\nsuicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2ol9, which stated that it was unclear at\nthe time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 3o, the determination of an inmate’s\ncompetency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s\nability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her oun defense.\nAfter a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the\nStaff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.\nThat same day, July 3o, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the\nSHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.\nOn July 3l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein\nand noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was geting readjusted to being in the\nSHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was geting along with his cellmate. According to her\nreport, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of\n\n47\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023415.tif": "harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or\npsychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her\nutilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need\nfor follou-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if\nneeded. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and\nSHU reviews.\nOn August l, 2ol9, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when\nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided\na form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner\nSchedule Report for July 3l, 2ol9, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in\nthe remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG\nthat the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was\npreviously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since\nEpstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on\nsuicide watch.\nFollouing receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist\nconducted a suicide risk assessment on August l that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical\nencounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to\nthe Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form\nnoted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident\nreport he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG\nconfirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept\nEpstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another\ncellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to\nhimself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had\nany of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had\nreasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently\npsychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist\nconcluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was lou, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.\nEpstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and\nemergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted\nthat Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be\nseen by Psychology Department staff the follouing week to monitor his mental status and provide further\nintervention, if needed.\nOn August 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follou-up session with Epstein. According to\nher report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The\nreport further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,\n<span class=\"highlight\">intention</span>, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to\nmake phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly\nphone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and\ndid not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any\nunusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and\n\n48\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033210.tif": ". that it captured images of .:.: others. (See probable cause\naffidavit at page l8). In particular, the probable cause affidavit notes that “on\nthe first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [was] found two covert cameras\nhidden in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the\nlibrary area behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was\nreviewed which shoued several images of [J and other witnesses\ninterviewed. All of these images appeared to come from the camera\npositioned behind Epstein’s desk”. (/d.) Omited from the Police Report and\nthe probable cause affidavit is the fact that the PBPD had knoun since 2oo3\nabout the presence of the cameras, and the specific reason for their installation.\nThe cameras were installed in 2oo3 after Epstein discovered that large sums of\ncash were missing from his home. Indeed, not only were the cameras\ninstalled at the suggestion of the PBPD, but the PBPD initially provided\nequipment that did not work and thereafter assisted in the installation of the\nequipment Epstein purchased. The cameras ultimately served their purpose\nand captured the image of former employee Juan Alessi, removing cash from\nEpstein’s briefcase after unlawfully entering the house. The recording of\nAlessi was turned over to the PBPD — indeed, to Det. Recarey himself. The\ncharacterization of the video equipment either as a surprise to the PBPD or as\nplaying a part in the alleged sexual activity in Epstein’s home (even though\nnone of the complainants ever made any mention of such equipment, or ever\nplaced any activity in the locations of the cameras), is false and misleading\nand suggests an <span class=\"highlight\">intention</span> to portray the facts to suit a particular goal.\n\n4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash. The Police Report details police\nfinding in Epstein’s trash what is described as pieces of “sex toys” and that\nthese “discoveries” purportedly corroborate witness statements. Omited from\nboth the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit is the fact that during\nthe course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the police\nrealized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the broken handle of a salad server.\nThough the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report and probable\ncause affidavit, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the discovery\nof this new and highly relevant evidence.\n\n5. Failure to Consider Exculpatory or Impeaching Evidence. Other\nexculpatory and impeaching evidence knoun by the PBPD was omited from\nthe Police Report and probable cause affidavit by, in our view, manipulating\nthe date the investigation was allegedly closed. According to the Police\nReport (at page 85), Det. Recarey “explained [to ASA Belohlavek] that the\nPBPD had concluded its case in December of 2oo5”. That assertion, which is\nfalse, conveniently resulted in the omission of all information adduced\nsubsequent to that date. Thus, though the Police Report in fact contains\ninformation obtained after December 2oo5, the PBPD escaped having to\nconsider, or even to include in the Police Report, the probable cause affidavit,\nor what it released to the public, all the exculpatory and impeaching evidence\npresented on behalf of Epstein, most of which was provided after December\n2oo5. That evidence is listed belou.\n\n3 Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo332lo"};
