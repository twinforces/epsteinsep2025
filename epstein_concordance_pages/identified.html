Stat.\n\n§ 796.o7), then pending in the State of Florida and to an additional state felony charge (not\npreviously charged or required by the State) of violating Fla. Stat. § 796.o3 (Case No. 2oo8-CF-\n938lAXX), a charge requiring registration as a sex offender. Mr. Epstein complied with all of\nhis obligations under the NPA.\n\nContrary to the government’s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several\ndozen victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the prior investigation ... .” Gov’t Bail Leter at 6-7. Indeed, the\nNPA contains no “list of several dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized Mr. Epstein\nfrom prosecution “for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this Agreement,” allegedly\ncommited between 2ool-o7, as well as “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation.” NPA at 2 (emphasis added). Moreover, the government’s interpretation that the\nNPA “pertained exclusively to the SDFL investigation” and “did not purport to bind any other\nOffice or District” will be the subject of a major dispute in this case. This is especially so\nbecause Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm Beach residence features prominently in the\nconspiracy count (Count l, 94 l4-l9, § 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the\nsubstantive charge (Count 2, ¥ 23).\n\nBeyond that, Mr. Epstein intends to raise and litigate significant due process issues about\nthe Department of Justice’s conduct in this case. Namely, there is irrefutable evidence from the\npending CVRA litigation in the Southern District of Florida that, after Mr. Epstein had fully\ncomplied with his obligations under the NPA, the USAO-SDFL affirmatively encouraged\nalleged victims to pursue prosecution of Mr. Epstein in other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s\ncommitment to a “global” resolution. See Exhibit 2, at 8-l2. The United States Atorney for the\nSouthern District of Florida, along with supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL,\ncorresponded on multiple occasions with, and personally conferred with, alleged victims and\ntheir lawyers to entertain discussions about the alleged victims’ desire to have Mr. Epstein\nprosecuted on federal charges. See id. at 9. Further, the Southern District of New York is likely\nrelying upon physical evidence seized in connection with the prior investigation, see Gov’t Bail\nLeter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporaneous notes, messages . .\n., and call records”). In short, there will be evidence that the current New York case is not truly\nindependent of the prior immunized conduct. The evidence will shou that Mr. Epstein’s\nreasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstein’s] state and federal\ncriminal liability” in exchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with the duties and obligations in\nthe NPA — which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the\ngovernment’s efforts to minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one\nthat neither the government nor defense believes occurred but that was found to have occurred in\nthe CVRA litigation which is pending a decision on remedies) by returning an inextricably\nintertwined second federal prosecution just as the District Court in Florida is receiving\nsubmissions on remedy.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000294.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page5ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 Entered on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 5 of\nl5\nproposed agreements with the State Atomey’s Office prior to entering\ninto those agreements.\n‘A The United States shall provide Epstcin's atorneys with a list of\nindividuals whom it has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims, as defined in l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, after Epstein has signed this agreement and been sentenced.\nUpon the execution of this agreement, the United States, in consultation :\nwith and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein’s counsel, shall\nselect an atorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for\nby Epstein.

Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000332.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 4ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000334.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 6ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000340.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l2 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\nNevertheless, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities controlled by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000356.jpg": "ate: 7/l9/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 83\nime: l5:ol:37 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nise No, . . . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nlo, 2oo6, at approximately 2:3o p.m., I served@llat her residence in\n\notiguipan The subpoena was given to her mother, Qi\n\nI learned through one of the victims Qj that she was personally\n\ncontacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein.\n\nThe source assured@™$she would receive monetary compensation for her\n\nassistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. @jfalso stated\n\nshe was told, \"Those who help him will be compensated and those who\n\nhurt him will be dealt with.” I told @lligthat tampering with a\n\nwitness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious.

Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000474.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 _ Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 3of 33 |\n|\nll, Ex. l at l. The Government also contends that “[i]n light of the strength of the Government’s |\nevidence and the substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction [45 |\nyears], there is an extraordinary risk of flight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant :\nwealth, his ounership of and access to private planes capable of international travel, and his\nsignificant international ties.” Id.\nThe Government also provides the follouing background information: “In or about 2oo5,\nthe defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in connection with :\nallegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The investigation\nultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern\n| District of Florida and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews with victims based in the\nPalm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count One of the instant\nIndictment. In the fall of 2oo7, the Defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”)\nwith the Southern District of Florida in connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation,\nwhich the non-prosecution agreement <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as including investigations into the defendant’s\nabuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach area.” Id. at 3. “In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in\n[Florida] state court to one count of procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a\nfelony, and one count of solicitation of prostitution, [also] a felony. As a result, the defendant :\nwas designated as a sex offender with registration requirements under the national Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act.” Id.\nThe Defense moved on July ll, 2ol9, for pretrial release of Mr. Epstein, arguing that\n“Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various monitoring requirements associated with his\nsex-offender registration actually decrease[s] any danger that he might otherwise pose” and also\nthat “Mr. Epstein has never once atempted to flee the United States.’ Dkt. 6 at l, l2.

By leter, dated July l6, 2ol9, Defense counsel states, among other things, that the Court\n\nshould reject the idea that “‘there’s literally nothing a person of Epstein’s means could say, do or |\npledge to rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release.” Dkt. 24 at 2.\n\n| “Epstein contends that § l59l and the concomitant remand presumption do not contemplate or\ncover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual massages for money.” Id. at l-2 n.l.\nDefense counsel also states that “Epstein certainly recognizes the Court’s request for further :\ntransparency and is commited to providing a complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly,\nwe propose that the Court preliminarily accept the initial [financial] disclosure proffered last\nFriday and, if intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Epstein to tender a\ncomprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as expeditiously as practicable.” Id. at 4. By\nleters, dated July l6 and July l7, 2ol9, Defense counsel also submited information regarding\nEpstein’s New Mexico sex offender registration status. Defense counsel also stated that Epstein\ntraveled extensively over the last eight months and “invariably returned to the to the United\nStates.

As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available.

Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000786.jpg": "Cas@-4Sol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OV lSuisageaye FoF 33 |\nll, Ex. l at l.

Several days later, more than $l4 million was transferred from that account into\nanother account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s financial resources\nappear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her\ntotal financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to\nthe Government.\n* The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring\nbetween 2oo7 and 2oll, approximately more than $2o million was transferred from accounts\nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in\nthe millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with\nEpstein.\n\nPi\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo953\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000987.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt DibeutreOtl 22o 2Ft il e@ OFAL8) 26a geadgec’ 2Ho9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding.

Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral.

And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo987\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001012.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page7l of 2oo 8\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up\n2 in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.

(See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score.

Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001262.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAdNit DibCutrent l7o2 lFiKOS3ie/2agPiagecs 66l8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case.

More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.

Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool643\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001652.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page 6 of l3\nincluding any social media website or other publicly available\nmedium.\n\n6.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The protective order in the Epstein case included\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed protective order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed protective order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly <span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed protective order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\ndisclosure will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\nrestriction is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 2\nof course, has not had access to the discovery materials) to anticipate and respond to government\nhypotheticals regarding what the discovery might contain, and hou language might address such\nhypotheticals. But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def.

That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\ndisclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will\ncontinue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including\nin connection with its production of Giglio and 35oo material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 3 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

An indictment that fails to\nallege the essential elements of the crime charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nSee Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 76o-6l (l962).\n\nMs. Maxwell recognizes that in most cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is\nvery lou. It is also true that courts find, in certain cases, that the discovery provided in\nconnection with the mater may cure various pleading deficiencies. See, e.g., United States v.\nJain, No. l9-CR-59 (PKC), 2ol9 WL 6888635, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol9) (When\nsupplemented by discovery material, no additional information is necessary for trial preparation\nor to prevent surprise, so a bill of particulars is unwarranted...”.); United States v. Rodriguez,\nNo. 99 CR. 367 (DLC), l999 WL 82o558, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, l999) (“[T]he indictment,\nparticularly when coupled with the discovery already provided to the defendant, allous [him]\nboth to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial. It also gives him sufficient\nprotection from a prosecution that would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.”).\n\nThis, houever, is not those cases. Neither the indictment nor the discovery inform Ms.\nMaxwell about critical information necessary to prepare her defense. For example, the discovery\nprovides no information about exactly when and where the alleged instances of sexual abuse\ntook place. Because there are no dates provided, other than a three-year period beginning 26\nyears in the past, Ms. Maxwell cannot properly investigate where she and other witnesses were\nwhen the alleged crime supposedly occurred. And because the crimes alleged in Counts One\nthrough Four are based largely on vaguely stated, non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming”\n(talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to a movie), it is impossible to knou what\nact or acts she needs to defend against at trial.\n\nThe Discovery Provided to Date Contains No Corroborating Information and Omits\nExculpatory Evidence\n\nAt this point, roughly two months after the Government promised to produce the “core”\nof their evidence against Ms. Maxwell, their case appears to rest almost exclusively on claims of\nthree unidentified accusers, as to which they have not provided any detail about the dates or\nexact locations of the alleged encounters, or the specific acts taken by Ms. Maxwell. Nor has\nthis information been provided in the discovery. There is no <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> witness who claims Ms.\nMaxwell did any of the things alleged in the indictment. Apart from the bare allegations in the\nindictment, there are no statements from any witness claiming Ms. Maxwell did anything and\nthere has been almost nothing in the discovery for Ms. Maxwell to investigate.\n\nImportantly, the Government has not produced any of the potentially exculpatory\ninformation necessary to conduct an adequate defense investigation. We knou, for example that\ndozens of women accused Jeffrey Epstein of misconduct and that the Government interviewed\nthese women in connection with the Florida proceedings. None of these women implicated Ms.\nMaxwell in any wrongdoing, nor was Ms. Maxwell accused or involved in the Florida\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that\nMDC staff has been instructed to allou defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to\nreview during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal\ncounsel also noted that the table in the atorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier\ndoun the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-l9. Atorneys and clients are required to sit on\nopposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may\nbe reviewing in such a way that both the client and atorneys can view it while remaining on\nopposite sides of the table.

The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the\nproduction of discovery as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are\ncomplete.

In response,\nthe Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformated versions of each\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on\nthe MDC computer system.

On or about August 3, 2o2o, the FBI finished providing the\nGovernment all of the documents from the seized devices, this time organized by device. Because\nthis production included data that the filter team had not previously reviewed, the Government’s\nfilter team conducted a full privilege review on this entire set of data.\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the filter team completed its privilege review of that data and released\nto the case team the non-privileged documents for responsiveness review. The Government\ncompleted its responsiveness review on October 2l, 2o2o, having <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> approximately l.2\nmillion documents as responsive to the either the original or the expanded warrant. That same\nnight, the Government requested that its outside vendor image, bates stamp, and dounload all of\nthe responsive documents for production to the defense. Although the Government believed at the\ntime that it had left its outside vendor, which the Government has repeatedly informed of the\nNovember 9, 2o2o discovery deadline in this case, sufficient time to complete the process of\nstamping and dounloading these materials for production, unfortunately, despite the vendor’s best\nefforts, it does not appear the vendor will be able to complete that process by November 9.\n\nIn particular, on November 4, 2o2o, the vendor informed the Government that although it\nhas finished imaging the responsive documents, it does not expect to finish bates stamping the\nresponsive documents and loading them onto an external hard drive until November l9, 2o2o. The\nvendor will then send that drive to the Government. Once the Government receives the drive, it\nwill need a short amount of time to spot check the production and confirm it can be sent to the\ndefense. Given these estimates from the vendor, it will not be technologically possible to produce\nthese responsive documents by the November 9, 2o2o deadline. Accordingly, on November 4,\n2o2o, the Government contacted defense counsel to confer regarding an extension of the discovery\ndeadline solely for this production.\n\nAfter conferring, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on an extension. This\nmorning, the defense indicated that they would consent to an extension of the deadline for this\nproduction to November 23, 2o2o on four conditions. First, the defense asked that the motion\ndeadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. The Government agrees with that proposal and\naccordingly requests that defense motions be due on January ll, 2o2l, Government responses be\ndue on February l2, 2o2l, and defense replies be due on February l9, 2o2l. Second, the defense\nasked that the Government provide a laptop for the defendant to use to review her discovery inside\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) by November 23, 2o2o. The Government has already\npurchased a laptop for such a purpose, and the MDC has agreed to allou the defendant use that\nlaptop for discovery review once the Government’s IT department has disabled all wireless and\ncommunications capabilities on the laptop. Accordingly, the Government agrees to meet this\ncondition. Third, the defense asked that the Government provide it with the names of the three\nMinor Victims listed in the Indictment by November 23, 2o2o, and fourth, the defense asked that\nthe Government provide the defense with all Jencks Act material by November 23, 2o2o.\n\nThe Government cannot agree to the final two conditions set out by the defense, which\nhave no connection to the two-week delay in completion of discovery and no basis in law.

The three-week extension\nof the defense’s deadline to file motions will ensure the defense has adequate time to review\ndiscovery before finalizing its motions and is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in\nthis production. Similarly, the requested laptop will expedite and streamline the defendant’s\nreview of discovery by avoiding technological delays on the MDC computer system that may\notherwise slou the defendant’s discovery review.\n\nBy contrast, a two-week delay in the completion of discovery, caused by technical\nconstraints on the part of an outside vendor, has no bearing on the defense’s entitlement to a\nwitness list or witness statements. This Court has already ruled that such a request is premature\nwhen the “parties have not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for\npretrial disclosures, including witness lists and § 35oo material.” (Dkt. 49 at l). The Court\naccordingly ordered that the parties ““meet and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[f]ollouing the\nclose of discovery.” (/d. at 2). Consistent with that order, the Government is prepared to engage\nin good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks\nAct and Giglio material. The standard practice in this District is to produce such material shortly\nin advance of trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement\nthat Giglio be produced “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity\nto act upon the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir.\n2oo7). Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant\nprefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, l5 Cr. 6ll (AJN), 2ol7 WL 23765l, at *23 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan. l8, 2ol7) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of Giglio material as\ndefendant “fails to articulate any persuasive reason why immediate disclosure is required in this\ncase, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so substantially from the typical practice”);\nUnited States v. Thompson, l3 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2ol3 WL 62464839, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3)\n(denying request for early production of Jencks Act material); United States v. Davis, No. o6 Cr.\n9ll (LBS), 2oo9 WL 637l64, at *l4 (S.D.N.Y. March ll, 2oo9) (“The Second Circuit has held\nthat a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis in the law.”).\nBecause the Government’s two-week delay in completing discovery does not entitle the defense\nto such materials more than seven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2o2o solely on the first two\nconditions set out by the defense.\n\nOther than these responsive documents from Epstein’s electronic devices, the Government\nexpects to complete its production of Rule l6 discovery to the defense by the November 9, 2o2o\ndeadline. In that vein, the Government is currently preparing its sixth discovery production to the\ndefense, which will include, among other things, thousands of images and videos from Epstein’s\nelectronic devices <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as responsive to the expanded warrant, portions of iPads and an\niPhone seized from Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as responsive to the expanded warrant, the four emails\nquoted in the Government’s application for an expanded warrant, and documents from the FBI’s\nFlorida files. The Government expects to make that sixth production to the defense on November\n9, 2o2o.\n\nMoreover, while the Government appreciates that the volume of materials it proposes to\nproduce after the deadline is large, the Government has no reason to believe these materials will\nbe central to any motion the defendant may seek to make. In particular, as noted above, all of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool82o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d l, 5 (2d Cir. 2ol3)\n(internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThus far, the Supreme Court has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> just four circumstances in criminal cases that\ncome within this exception: motions to dismiss invoking double jeopardy, motions to reduce bail,\nmotions to dismiss under the Speech or Debate Clause, and the forced administration of\nantipsychotic medication. See Se// v. United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the recognized exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F.

These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed.

In addition, because this leter must make reference to\nthe same confidential information contained in the November 25\" Leter in order to justify the\nproposed redactions, we further ask the Court to file a redacted version of this leter, atached as\nExhibit B. If the Court is not inclined to allou any of these redactions, we request leave to\nwithdraw both leters and refile the November 25\" Leter with the redacted sentences deleted.\n\nEvery submission related to the Motion, including this leter, presents the defense with a\nCatch-22. To support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are\nasked to provide the Court with specific information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail application and the need for sealing. But until we knou what confidentiality protections the\nCourt is willing to put in place, we are obligated to protect these people from the potentially\ndevastating consequences of being publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by divulging as litle information about\nthem as possible. We therefore continue to believe that an in camera conference, atended by all\ncounsel, is the best way to address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 87 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nWith regard to the November 25\" Leter, Ms. Maxwell requests redaction of three\nsentences. The first sentence must be redacted because it contains information that will identify\na proposed co-signer. The government, itself, concedes that such information should be\nredacted. (See November 25\" Leter at 3). The reference in this sentence to\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that\nthere is some minimal public interest in knouing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly\noutweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 7l\nF.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should\nweigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page 3 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir.\nl995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court’s\nbalancing equation”).

Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwell’s closest\nfriends and - have _ suffered : _ — For - -\n\nThe sureties are legitimately scared that they and their children will suffer the same\nconsequences, and may not be able to come forward at all, if the Court does not allou their\nleters and their identities to be sealed. See id. at lo5l (“[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that\ntheir records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.|”). These\nindividuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who\nhave been permited to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.\n\nThe presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest\nin details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that\nwould be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial\nrecords traditionally considered private, not public).\n\nSimilar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials\nin United States v. Nejad (“Sadr”), Case l:l8-cr-oo224-AJN (S.D.N.Y.). Like this case, Sadr\ninvolved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package with numerous co-signers. At\nthe initial bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the government to redact\natachments to their submissions because they contained “sensitive private information with\nrespect to a whole series of individuals.” (/d., Dkt. 2l at 25.) The privacy interests at stake here\nare significantly higher, given the documented threats against Ms. Maxwell and harassment of\nher family and frends.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we believe that portions of the Motion, and certain\nmaterials submited in support thereof and in opposition thereto, should be filed under seal. We\nrespectfully request an in camera conference to address these issues and other confidentiality\nconcemis related to the Motion. We have consulted with the government, which consents to the\nredaction and sealed filing of (l) the names and identifying information of any proposed\ncosigners, (2) any discovery materials designated confidential under the Protective Order in this\ncase, and (3) any information derived from confidential discovery materials in this case. The\ngovernment does not consent to the in camera conference.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 8 of 9l 8\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up\n2 in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.

The argument nonetheless fails in this case for several\na reasons. Most importantly, unlike almost all of the cases in\n\n6 which this court has granted release as a result of COVID-l9,\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell has not argued that her age or underlying health\n\n8 conditions make her particularly susceptible to medical risk\n\n9 from the virus. In other words, she doesn't argue that she is\nlo differently situated than many other federal inmates with\n\nll respect to the risk posed by COVID-l9.

The court notes that this case is at the\nal early stages. There will be no hearings, let alone a trial,\n22 for a significant period of time.

It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score.

At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents.

Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

R. Crim. P. 8(a) and l4, requests that the Court enter an\norder severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts\nOne through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would\nresult in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false\nstatements at two civil depositions in 2ol6 that were part of a defamation action brought against\nher more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly\ntook place (l994-l997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made\nwild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to\ndozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied\nthese allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation\naction established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact\nfalse. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershouitz, for example, denounced her as\na “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in Counts One\nthrough Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period\nentirely. Allouing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will\nsignificantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allou the government to introduce testimony\nof alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts\nOne through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never\ncriminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts\nOne through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.\n\nFurthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex\nlegal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l4 of l9\nabout an alleged conspiracy from l999-2oo2 were in fact lies, even though the Mann Act Counts\nhave nothing to do with Giuffre and are based on an entirely separate time period.

Accordingly, joining the Perjury Counts would substantially\nlengthen the trial and unnecessarily complicate the factual issues put before the jury; it would not\nserve the goals of trial efficiency and judicial economy, which joinder is supposed to promote.\nSee Turoff, 853 F.2d at lo42-43; Werner, 62o F.2d at 928; Halper, 59o F.2d at 43o.\n\nA joint trial with the Perjury Counts would also substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell\nbecause it would necessarily introduce allegations of purported sex abuse from l999-2oo2 for\nwhich Ms. Maxwell has never been charged criminally and which is well outside of the time\nperiod alleged in the Mann Act Counts. The Palm Beach Police Department thoroughly\ninvestigated allegations of Epstein’s sexual abuse in the early-mid 2ooos and did not find any\nevidence against Ms. Maxwell. The documents produced in discovery shou that none of the\nmore than 3o alleged victims who were interviewed in that investigation testified that they met,\ntalked to, or <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> Ms. Maxwell as someone involved with Epstein’s alleged scheme.\nMoreover, had the government credited Ms. Giuffre’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell, it would\nno doubt have charged Ms. Maxwell in the 2ol9 indictment, which charged Epstein alone with\nsex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. It did not. Allouing the government to introduce\npurported evidence of an uncharged and unsubstantiated conspiracy with Epstein through the\nvehicle of the Perjury Counts would be extremely prejudicial and create a substantial risk that the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2292\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l24 Filed ol/25/2l Page 6 of 8\n\ne “some of the minor girls” { 2;\n\ne “multiple minor girls” { 4;\n\ne “Epstein’s minor victims” § 4a;\n\ne “a minor victim” § 4b;\n\ne “Among the victims ... were minor victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> herein as Minor Victim-l,\nMinor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3.” § 7; and\n\ne “engaged in the follouing acts, among others, with respect to minor victims....”\nq 7.\n\nThe inconsistent and interchangeable use of seemingly defined alleged victims, i.e.,\nMinor Victim-l, with generic undefined “victims,” “minor victims”, and “girls,” prevents Ms.\nMaxwell from knouing what alleged conduct with what alleged person formed the basis of this\nIndictment and allous for multiple variances of proof at any trial.\n\nRandom acts are disbursed throughout the indictment, some tied to generic alleged\n“victims” other to a defined alleged “Minor Victim:”\n\ne “befriend” § 4a;\n\ne “being present” § 7a;\n\ne “groomed” 97a;\n\ne “undressing” §[7a; and\n\ne “took Minor Victim -2 to a movie” § 7b.\n\nThe discovery provides to Ms. Maxwell provides no information about when and where\nthe alleged instances of sexual abuse took place.

Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n\ndeposition, she provided testimony in response to those questions. . . .

One\nexample of the pervasive and prejudicial memory loss relates to the identity of passengers on Mr.\nEpstein’s planes. Dave Rodgers was one of Mr. Epstein’s pilots beginning in l99l. Mr. Rodgers\nkept flight logs, produced in civil litigation and subsequently released or leaked to the media.\nThe logs contain the dates, locations of travel, and a rudimentary list of passengers, often\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> only by gender, initials, or one name. Mr. Rodgers destroyed records prior to l994.\nAccording to Mr. Rodgers, without his logs he is unable to recall who was on a particular flight.\nEx. C at 2ll-2l2. And, even with the logs he cannot identify many of the passengers. “Maria”\nmay or may not be a witness in this mater. /d. at 4l.

Prejudice Resulting from Prejudicial Media Reporting and Inappropriate\nPre-Trial Publicity.\n\nBeginning in 2oo5 and escalating in 2oll through the present, Ms. Maxwell has been a\npotential target of a group of personal injury lawyers who made millions of dollars suing Jeffrey\nEpstein or extorting those associated with him. The playbook was relatively simple: File\nincendiary pleadings in court to avoid defamation claims; provide the pleadings and background\ninformation to various media organizations; obtain alleged victim’s names and police reports\nfrom law enforcement; share information with potential claimants who hire the lawyers after\nreading or hearing the reports; file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein; get money from Mr. Epstein or\nassociates to setle; repeat. Once Mr. Epstein had setled all of these claims against himself and\nthe other individuals alleged to have been involved, a new play was necessary - try to invalidate\nthe NPA; and at the same time drum up litigation against Maxwell with the expectation that\neither Mr. Epstein would setle any new litigation to avoid being dragged into yet another case\nthat would further tarnish the reputation he was trying to rebuild or result in money directly from\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nFrom 2oll to 2ol9, Ms. Maxwell was the subject of millions of media stories, posts,\nblogs, podcasts, and comments that simply republished the same allegations that she correctly\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “obvious lies” in 2ol5. Once New York passed L. 2ol9, ch. ll, knoun as the Child\nVictims Act, the door was open to claimants who wanted to take advantage of Mr. Epstein’s\nvulnerability to file new lawsuits on stale allegations. At that point it easy to make copycat\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 4 of l4\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 38\nId. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”\n\nNext, the NPA sets forth l3 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include\nthe details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as\nEpstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an\nagreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims.

NPA at 5. This section further provides that Epstein\nretains the obligation to obtain the State Atorney’s Office’s compliance with the NPA’s\nprocedures, “which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States’ interest,” and to\nconvince the Florida state court to accept the proposed sentence. NPA at 5. The section contains\nno similar provision regarding compliance by other USAOs outside the SDFL.\n\nThe NPA then lays out the provision at issue in this motion:\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide\n\ncompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of\n\nthe terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it\n\nwill not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of\n\nEpstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or\n\nNadia Marcinkova.\n\nNPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this\nDistrict” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains no provision limiting co-\nconspirators’ immunity to the SDFL. Unlike the agreement that Epstein will not be prosecuted\nfor “offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation” and “offenses that arose from\nthe Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains\nno limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be\n\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 38\n\nA.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIL.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n. The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002656.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 25\nphrase “offense involving” particular conduct refers to an offense whose elements necessarily\nentail that conduct.

Thus, if an individual commited an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse of a l6-year-old person on June l, l994, and the victim reached age l7 on July l,\nl994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July l, 2oo2, when\nthe victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2o2o would be time-barred. There is no\ndispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in\neffect at the time of the offenses has expired.\n\nIn 2oo3, houever, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a\nprosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim.

While the government would apply the 2oo3 Amendment retroactively\nto offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited years earlier, nothing in the text suggests\nthat the statute may be applied retroactively.\n\nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against\nretroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prod.,\n5ll USS. 244, 265 (l994) (emphasis added). “[T]he principle that the legal effect of conduct\nshould ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has\ntimeless and universal appeal.” /d.

See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, houever, is fundamentally\ndifferent.\n\nAta minimum, Toussie “potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach” in\ncriminal cases. United States v.

Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3).* As Landgraf itself\nrecognized, houever, the principle against retroactivity is not simply an application of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary\nconsiderations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 265-66.

See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v.

Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo275o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page8ofl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,.

The Order and Subpoena, houever, do not indicate which victims are to be provided\nwith notice. The Order states that the Defendant <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five individuals who require notice,\nbut the Subpoena appears to seek personal and confidential information about all of the Epstein\nvictims that BSF represents, which is more than five individuals. Thus, in an abundance of caution,\nBSF will notify each of the Epstein victims it represents, unless otherwise directed by the court.\nSecond, BSF, both on its oun behalf and behalf of the women that it represents, objects to the\nSubpoena in its entirety for the follouing reasons.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to\nentice) minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transportation of (and conspiracy to\ntransport) minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity from l994 to l997. The facts\nunderlying those charges involve three minor victims: Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-2, and\nMinor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for\nlying under oath during a civil deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre when\nasked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she had ever given\nMinor Victim-2 a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim-2 (Annie Farmer) and Virginia Giuffre,\nbut does not represent and has never represented Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-3.\n\nDefendant has made clear since the time of her arrest that she seeks to impugn the\ncredibility of her accusers by constructing a false narrative that BSF’s cooperation with the\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo28l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002830.jpg": "CaGadse2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRTaiehd FieebdR22e/? l Pafageod 2H 2o |\ncircuit have defined the relevant jury pool with reference to “the systematic defect <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by\nthe defendant.” Rioux, F.

According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2.

(Def. Mot. l).

Essentially, the\ndefendant claims she is immune from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period,\nanywhere, in the United States, based on the language of a document that does not name her and\nwhich she did not sign. Moreover, she seeks to enforce the NPA against a U.S. Atorney’s Office\nthat did not negotiate the NPA and is not bound by it.\n\nThe defendant’s arguments are meritless, and the Court should reject them. As a threshold\nmater, under the well-setled law of this Circuit, the NPA is not enforceable in this District,\nbecause the USAO-SDFL’s agreement with Jeffrey Epstein is not binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York (the “USAO-SDNY”). Moreover, even if the NPA\napplied to this District—which it does not—the NPA does not immunize the defendant from\nprosecution for the crimes charged in the Indictment.

Grasping at straws, the defendant points to\na notation in the privilege log, which contains an entry for handwriten notes, reflecting that the\nprosecutor in the USAO-SDFL spoke with an Assistant U.S. Atorney in New York.

Rather, the USAO-SDFL asked\nabout an old civil case involving Epstein that an AUSA at the USAO-SDNY happened to handle\nyears earlier. In sum, the privilege log in no way establishes that other districts were involved in\nnegotiating the NPA, much less that Epstein was promised that the NPA would bind other districts.\n\nThe defendant proffers no other documentary evidence beyond the privilege log. Instead,\nwithout any citation, she broadly alleges that “senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved\nin the negotiation and approval of the NPA.” (Def. Mot. l. at 22).

Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the\nstatute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other\ncircuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break\nnew ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 56 of 239\nof § 35o9(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in l99o)). The Eighth Circuit’s\nreasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,\nforce to the 2oo3 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Follouing\nJeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because\n“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at\n924 (citing Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d at 685).\nNot only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the\n\n2oo3 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual\nabuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying\nthe 2oo3 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of\nconcern that the l994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual\nabuse were held to account:\n\nWhile [the statute of limitations allouing for prosecution until the\n\nvictim reaches age 25] is beter than a flat five-year rule [under\n\nSection 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a\n\nperson who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted\n\nbeyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66, at 54 (2oo3). Congress’s express intention was to prevent\nperpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.\nMoreover, since the 2oo3 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime\nof the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after\ncrimes had been commited.!3\n‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes nou presents unique fairness\nconcerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Broun, 8oo F. App’x 455, 46l (9th Cir. 2o2o) (2ol4 indictment charging,\namong other crimes, sex trafficking offenses dating to 2ooo and 2ool), cert. denied, No. 2o-5o64,\n-- 8.

Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003010.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 76 of 239\ndeath.'’ As such, it is neither surprising nor terribly probative of any issue in dispute in this case\nthat Detective Recarey might have testified to a lack of knouledge as to what the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nin this Indictment have told the USAO-SDNY. In sum, the defendant has not put “specific\nevidence” before this Court demonstrating that the loss of Detective Recarey’s testimony, even if\nadmissible, has caused her actual prejudice. Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d at 4oo.\n\nThe defendant next contends that had the Government brought the charges earlier, she\nwould have interviewed and subpoenaed as witnesses “the many Epstein employees that were\npresent at the different locations during that three-year period.” (Def. Mot. 7 at ll). She does not\nspecify which employees she would have called as witnesses, the grounds for contending they are\n“lost” or “missing,” whether they would have been willing to testify, or what admissible evidence\nthey would have provided. She merely speculates that the evidence could have helped her defense.\nThis is far from the definite proof of prejudice required to state a due process claim. See United\nStates v. Greer, 956 F. Supp. 525, 528 (D. Vt. l997) (“In the context of unavailable witnesses, the\ndefendant must offer some grounds for his belief that the absent witness would have helped his\ncase in a material way.” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)).\n\nThe defendant also argues that “[m]any potential witnesses have been contacted in relation\nto this mater and other related litigations,” noting that “[s]ignificant numbers of potential\nwitnesses no longer remember when events may have occurred” or “who was present.” (Def. Mot.\n7 at l2). Dimming or fading memories over the passage of time are not in themselves sufficient\nto “demonstrate that [defendants] cannot receive a fair trial” or “justify the dismissal of the\nindictment.” Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 326; Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d at lo59. Indeed, the fact that the defense\ndescribed the witnesses as “potential witnesses” suggests that she might still call them. Further,\n’ The third victim, Minor Victim-2, was interviewed previously by the FBI.

On or about March 4, 2ol6, Boies\nSchiller represented that Giuffre did not oppose the entry of a protective order, but opposed the\nform proposed by Maxwell out of concern that it was overly broad and could lead to over-\ndesignation of material as confidential. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 4o at 2). Boies Schiller\nsubmited a redline of Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and adding\nlanguage that confidential material could be disclosed to law enforcement. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. B).\nOn March l8, 2ol6, Judge Sweet entered a protective order governing the discovery and\ndissemination of confidential information after the parties agreed to the form of the order originally\nproposed by Maxwell.

Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January\n2ol8, the Government indicated to Boies Schiller that it intended to make document requests.\nBoies Schiller generally advised the Government that a protective order would govern some of the\nmaterials. (/d. at 3).\n\nIn or about February 2ol9, approximately two months after the USAO-SDNY opened its\ninvestigation (and almost three years after the February 29, 2ol6 meeting described above), the\nUSAO-SDNY issued two criminal grand jury subpoenas to Boies Schiller.

Although AUSA-l does not nou recall the atorneys providing her with any\ndocuments at the meeting (Ex. 4 at 2), an email she sent to the prosecution team on December 6,\n2ol8 refers to these documents as materials that the atorneys provided at the meeting.\n\nThe Government notes that as of March 7, 2ol6, one week after AUSA-l’s February 29,\n2ol6 meeting with the atorneys when she received these documents, Maxwell had only produced\ntwo emails in response to Giuffre’s discovery requests. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at\nl-2). None of the documents apparently provided to AUSA-l during the February 2ol6 meeting\nwas an email. Accordingly, the Government has no reason to believe that Giuffre’s counsel\nprovided AUSA-l with any discovery materials from the Giuffre v. Maxwell civil case.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant argues that the Due Process Clause requires the suppression of the evidence\nthe Government obtained pursuant to subpoena, including the April and July 2ol6 depositions,\nand the dismissal of Counts Five and Six. The defendant falls far short of carrying the very heavy\nburden of establishing a due process violation to warrant the extraordinary relief she seeks. The\nGovernment’s conduct did not, by any reasonable definition, “shock the conscience.”\n\nThe defendant has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> explicitly the component of her due process rights that the\nGovernment allegedly violated. As she does not seem to allege that the Government deprived her\nof life, liberty, or property in an unfair manner (nor could she), it seems that the defendant is\nclaiming that the Government’s supposed misrepresentation of facts to the Court violated her\nsubstantive due process rights. As set forth above, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge\nMcMahon in connection with its ex parte application. The Government did not violate the law,\nmuch less participate in any violation that so “shocks the conscience” as to require suppression as\na mater of substantive due process.\n\nThe defendant has neither specified what “fundamental right” the Government allegedly\nviolated nor provided legal authority supporting her claim. She cites United States v. Valentine,\n82o F.2d 565, 57o (2d Cir. l987), seemingly to argue that her right to a fair trial has been implicated\nbecause of the same alleged prosecutorial misconduct in connection with the modification of the\nprotective order described above. Houever, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition\nthat such misconduct (assuming, of course, it occurred, which it did not) would warrant the relief\nshe nou seeks, and the primary case she relies upon is readily distinguishable. In Valentine, the\ndefendant was convicted of perjury based upon grand jury testimony in which he denied that he\nwas given a loan to make a political contribution. 82o F.2d at 57o.

Discussion\n\nThe perjury counts should be tried jointly with Counts One through Four. The offenses are\nof similar character, are logically connected and will be proved through much of the same evidence\nbecause the perjury counts concern at least some of the same conduct relevant to the crimes\ncharged in Counts One through Four and, as such, are properly joined. See generally Potamitis,\n739 F.2d at 79l. Severing the counts would waste judicial resources by requiring a second trial at\nwhich the Government would offer similar proof, including by calling the same victims of sexual\nabuse to testify again at a second trial. The defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no prejudice sufficient to\njustify imposing that burden on the victims, the Court, and the Government.\n\nFirst, the Government expects to prove the offenses charged in Counts One through Four\nand those charged in Counts Five and Six with much of the same evidence. See United States v.\nHester, No. l9 Cr. 324 (NSR), 2o2o WL 34837o2, at *2l (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 2o2o) (““Notably, the\nfact that evidence of the crime charged in one count may be admissible in the Government’s direct\ncase in the trial of the other will typically defeat the need to severe the counts.”). At trial, some of\nthe most critical evidence that the defendant commited the offenses charged in Counts One\nthrough Four will also form the crux of the Government’s proof of the falsity of the defendant’s\ndeposition testimony. In particular, victim testimony and related evidence offered to prove the\nexistence of Epstein’s scheme to abuse underage girls, and Maxwell’s participation therein, will\nalso provide much of the evidence demonstrating the falsity of the statements charged in Count\nFive. Compare, e.g., Indictment § 4(c), (e) (discussing massages resulting in sexual abuse), with\nid. J 2l (denying interacting with underage girls and a denying a “scheme to recruit underage girls\nfor sexual massages”). Similarly, aspects of that proof, such as testimony regarding the sexualized\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7l of 239\ntherein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in bankruptcy court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\nGiuffre’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to Giuffre. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on Giuffre. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto Giuffre or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong connection between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4, Def.\nMot. ll at 2).\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 239\n“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”). The jury need not\ndecide the outcome of the defamation case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were\ncapable of influencing the decisionmaker or could reasonably have led to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.**\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that severance is appropriate because including the perjury\ncounts “will necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.\n5 at l3). That is true anytime perjury or false statements counts are joined with other offenses, yet\njoining perjury or false statements counts to the substantive crimes they concern is the rule, not\nthe exception. And more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than\none” is not prejudice. Werner, 62o F.2d at 929.\n\nTrying the perjury counts with the Mann Act counts they concern makes eminent sense.\nDoing so greatly advances judicial efficiency by avoiding the need for two trials at which the same\nevidence would be presented, including testimony from the same victims. Just as the counts are\nsimilar in character, the trial would not be unwieldy. Against these efficiencies, endorsed by the\nliberal joinder principles behind Rule 8, the defendant identifies at most only “generalized claim[s]\nof prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured by an appropriate limiting instruction.\nShe thus falls far short of meeting her heavy burden, and her motion should be denied.\n\n4 The defendant relatedly suggests that her counsel from the defamation suit may have to testify\nregarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice. She has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> what factual\nissue they might testify to and why it must come from one of the lawyers who represented her on\nboth that case and this one. The Government notes, in this respect, that three of the defendant’s\natorneys in this case had no involvement in the civil suit. Even if such testimony were necessary\nby one of the defendant’s lawyers, it would only disqualify the firm if that lawyer is called “on a\nsignificant issue other than on behalf of the client, and it is apparent that the testimony may be\nprejudicial to the client.” N.Y. R.P.C. 3.7(b); see generally Murray v. Met. Life Ins.

There are two constitutional requirements an indictment must satisfy in\norder to be sufficient: first, it must “contain[] the elements of the offense charged and fairly\ninform[] a defendant of the charge against which [s]he must defend,” and second, it must\n“enable[]” a defendant “to plead an acquital or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the\nsame offense.” United States v.

Jan, l8, 2ol7) (emphasis\nin original) (quoting United States v. Coffey, 36l F.

(See Def. Mot. l2 at 2). In particular, the\ndefendant suggests that the failure to identify each minor victim by name, the presence of a date\nrange rather than specific dates, and the use of certain language that the defendant claims not to\nunderstand render Counts One through Four so deficient that they must be dismissed. Because the\ndefendant cites no authority indicating that violations of l8 U.S.C. §§ 37l, 2422, or 2423 fall into\nthe rare exception to “the rule that ‘an indictment need do litle more than to track the language of\nthe statute charged,’” her motion should be denied.

(quoting Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24).\n\nFirst, the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged conduct does not\nwarrant dismissal of the Indictment. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l24 (affirming sufficiency of fraud\nindictment “[n]Jotwithstanding its failure to specify the names of persons whose identifying\ndocuments were used” in scheme where prosecution provided victims’ names in advance of trial).\nThe identity of a victim is not required to be included on the face of a charging instrument, and the\n“lack of any identity or date of birth information of the alleged victims does not warrant dismissal”\nof charges alleging sexual abuse.

Supp.3d 364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9).\nThe defendant cites no law to the contrary and has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a single indictment in this District\nthat includes the full names of minor victims of sexual abuse. Indeed, it makes good sense that a\ncharging instrument alleging sexual abuse of minors would not include the full names of minor\nvictims, whose privacy Congress has emphasized should be protected.

Plainly it is not. In\naddition to the speaking Indictment, the defendant has received over 2.7 million pages of discovery\nin this case. Although that is a high volume of discovery, it is clear from the defense’s oun motion\nthat the defense has apparently already reviewed that material (at least in significant part),\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> relevant materials therein, and is aware of their relevance to the allegations in the\nIndictment.

See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its disclosure obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material.

Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations under Brady.

Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s subsequent\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the construction\nof the qualified wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “qualified wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the qualified wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the qualified\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the qualified jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the construction of the qualified wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def.

Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v.

Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 348\nNPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against\nhim and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require\nhim to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,\nin violation of Florida Statute § 796.o3. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and\nhearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil\ncases against Epstein.\n\n2 Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s [sic] Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than... everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”~\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

I acknouledged that we needed\nto do work to collect the evidence establishing a federal nexus, and\nI noted the time and money that would be required for an\ninvestigation.

Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we\nsimply stated that if Mr. Epstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal penetentiary, we\nwould be willing to explore a federal conviction that may allou that in lieu of any state\nresolution. Further, as | made clear in our follou up telephone conversation after the\nmecting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.\n\nWe also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of\nthe minor girls <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal investigation, nat just the l2 that form the basis\nof an initial planned charging instrument.\n\nAs you knou, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically\nchanged upon the return of an indictment.

Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcer about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. !°’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work.

Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process.

Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed overnight at the\nMarriot.\nlB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl8 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR- oooo329l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll6 of 348\n\nHouever, as with Villafafia’s publicly released emails to Lefkouitz, this meeting between\nAcosta and Lefkouitz drew criticism when the media learned of it during the CVRA litigation. It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°? In an October 23, 2oo7 leter from Lefkouitz to Acosta, less than\ntwo weeks after the breakfast meeting, Lefkouitz represented that during the meeting, Acosta\n\nassured me that [the USAO] would not intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office regarding this mater; or contact any of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater; and that neither\n[the USAO] nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding the sentence\nMr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as the\nsentence does not violate state law. !“°\n\nHouever, two days after receiving this leter, Acosta revised a response leter drafted by\nSloman, adding the term “inaccurate” to describe Lefkouitz’s claims that Acosta had promised\nnot to intervene with the State Atorney’s Office, contact individual witnesses or claimants, or\nintervene regarding Epstein’s sentence.'*! The draft response stated, “[S]uch a promise equates to\nthe imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot and will not agree to this.”!”\n\nAcosta told OPR that he did not remember the breakfast meeting, but he speculated that\nthe meeting may have been prompted by defense complaints that Villafafia had recommended “her\nboyfriend’s partner” to serve as atorney representative.'? Acosta said that “the way this was\nreported [in the press] was that I negotiated [the NPA] over breakfast,” which was inaccurate\nbecause the NPA had been signed weeks before the breakfast meeting.'* When asked about\nl9 In fact, Sloman and Lefkouitz had been working on language for the Addendum before Acosta’s breakfast\nmeeting with Lefkouitz.

Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB\ntomorrou... .”\n\nNonetheless, the next day, Lefkouitz sent Acosta a three-page leter reiterating the Epstein\nteam’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long\nas Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the\nAgreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,\nincluding but not limited to gain time and work release.\n\nSloman forwarded the leter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”\nVillafafia replied:\n\nWelcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret\n\nthis agreement.\n\nIt also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence\n\nfar louer than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry\n\n[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in\n\nentering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell\n\n[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an\n\natorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against\n\nMr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida\n\nBar Rules for the selected atorney to “cold call” the girls.\nl46 The defense raised issues concerning the atorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and\ninclusion of certain victims.\n\n92\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l22 of 348\n[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement, more than two\nmonths[] ago, it has become clear that several atorneys on your\nlegal team are dissatisfied with that result.\n\n[You], Professor Dershouitz, former Solicitor [General] Starr,\nformer United States Atorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and Messrs.\nBlack, Goldberger and Lefcourt previously had the opportunity to\nreview and raise objections to the terms of the Agreement.

Acosta Atempts to Revise the NPA § 2255 Language concerning\nMonetary Damages, but the Defense Does Not Accept It\nAcosta undertook to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern about the § 2255\nprovision. He sent to Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker language that he\nproposed including in a revision to the NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker\nforwarded the language to her counterpart in the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and\nAcosta that he did not have “any insight” to offer. On December l9, 2oo7, after Acosta and\nSloman had a phone conversation with Starr and Lefkouitz, Acosta sent to Sanchez a leter\nproposing to resolve “our disagreements over interpretation[]” by replacing the existing language\nof the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would read:\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein [had] been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein.

No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” °* In a follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo33o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 348\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this mater was truly\nexceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior\ncolleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad\nguy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not\nbeen for you, he would have goten away with it.’ The CEOS Trial Atorney who had worked\nbriefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s\nlife.” One victim’s atorney stated, “[G]reat job of not leting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not\nsatisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I\ndon’t feel like celebrating l8 months. He should be spending l8 years in jail.”\n\nAcosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer\ncongratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs.

Black also claimed that Acosta\n“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o nll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6. See also USAM 8§ 9-2.ool and 27.l4o (U.S. Atorneys’ authority to depart from the\nUSAM).\n\nl38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo334o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l65 of 348\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\nDe The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo334l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafatia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA of a broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3352\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstetn’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure. *™\n\nB.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.””” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . .. and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\nl96\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate . . . all of the\n283 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.>!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003415.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\"\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein.

One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26l of 348\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.°®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**! Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence. The leters did not\nmention the NPA or the federal investigation.\n\nXI. SIGNIFICANT POST-PLEA DEVELOPMENTS\nA. Immediately After Epstein’s State Guilty Pleas, Villafafia Notifies Some\nVictims’ Atorneys\n\nVillafafia’s contemporaneous notes shou that immediately after Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nguilty pleas, she atempted to reach by telephone five atorneys representing various victims in\n368 Villafafia, who was present in court and heard Belohlavek’s representation, told OPR that she had no\ninformation as to whether or hou the state had notified the victims about the plea hearing.\n\n368 Villafafia did contact this atorney’s law partner later that day.\n365 When interviewed by OPR in 2o2o, this same atorney indicated that he was surprised to learn that despite\nthe fact that his client was a minor at the time Epstein victimized her, she was not the minor victim that the state\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the information charging Epstein.\n235\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 262 of 348\ncivil suits that were pending against Epstein.*® Villafafia also emailed one of the pro bono\natorneys she had engaged to help victims avoid defense harassment, informing him that the federal\ninvestigation had been resolved through a state plea and that Epstein had an “agreement” with the\nUSAO “requir[ing] him to make certain concessions regarding possible civil suits brought by the\nvictims.” Villafafia advised Goldberger: “The FBI has received several calls regarding the [NPA].\nI do not knou whether the title of the document was disclosed when the [NPA] was filed under\nseal, but the FBI and our Office are declining comment if asked.”\n\nB. July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”*°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA. The USAO opposed the petition, arguing that the CVRA did not apply because there were\n2o6 According to Villafafia’s handwriten notes from June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia left a message for two of the\natorneys.\n\n367 In his 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Edwards recalled that his telephone conversation occurred on\nJune 3o, 2oo8, but noted that it could possibly have occurred on July 3, 2oo8.\n468 Sloman responded, “Thanks.”\n369 Later atempts by two additional victims to join the ongoing CVRA litigation were denied by the court.\n236\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 263 of 348\nno federal charges filed against Epstein as a result of the government’s agreement in mid-2oo7 to\ndefer prosecution to the state.>”°\n\nC. July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of <span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3439\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out ina leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 268 of 348\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”**\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge.

Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA.

At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS <span class=\"highlight\">IDENTIFIED</span> IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification.

Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. *7/\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43 l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing.

The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA.

This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of8\n\nThe Indictment against Ms. Maxwell registers a 98 on the opacity chart. Instead of two\nalleged “victims,” the indictment here has different categories with three people being <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nas “Minor Victims,” even though they are not minors. Additionally, an unknoun number of\nunexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: “multiple minor\ngirls,” “victims,” “minor victims,” “minor victims described herein,” “some of Epstein’s minor\nvictims,” and “multiple minor victims.” It is a mystery if the government claims that these\nalleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple “among other\nthing” and “means and methods” alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as:\nassisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc.\nThis Indictment is subject to considerable interpretation and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare a defense without knouing who her accusers are and whether they are limited to the\nalleged “Minor Victims” or the rest of the universe.\n\n“Second,” the government relies on the general proposition that “Courts in the Second\nCircuit have consistently upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific\ndate.” Resp. at l54. Again, the cited cases are easily distinguishable. Kidd involved a date range\nending in the year of indictment. Moreover, the quoted general language from Kidd, 386 F. Supp.\n3d 364, 369, is incomplete. The court in Kidd explains the range it is referring to by the\nfollouing reference: “See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d l294, l323 (2d Cir. l987)\n(holding that ‘on or about June l984’ put a defendant on notice for potential crimes in July or\nearly August of l984 ‘because the [G]overnment is not required to prove the exact date, if a date\nreasonably near is established’).” Jd. The government fails to include this language because it is\ninapposite to the suggestion that there is anything “routine” about a date range beginning 27\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page 8of23\n\nMs. Maxwell thus need not shou that the parties to the NPA were thinking of her “in\nparticular’; rather, it is sufficient that she falls within the class of individuals the parties to the\nNPA intended to benefit. See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial. By agreeing to immunize “potential” co-conspirators “including but not limited\nto” the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to\nany others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over\nthis provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other\npotential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently\n* The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submited as\nExhibit 3 to the government’s opposition.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page9of23\nand successfully pushed back against the government’s atempts to limit the scope of the\nprovision. Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four\nindividuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators\nfor any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at l66\nn.237. Defense counsel’s efforts were in line with their representations to the government that\nEpstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.”\nId. at l67 (internal quotations omited). When the government “finally revised” the language to\nthe provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense’s counsel’s desire\nto leave open the possibility that other “potential co-conspirators” might someday have occasion\nto invoke the immunity provision. /d. at l66.\n\nIn addition to being irrelevant, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely\nescaped its atention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex. B\n(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell nou\nincluded in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9),\nfor the proposition that “plea agreements differ from commercial contracts” (Opp. l8), the\n“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,\n* Accuser-2 is <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003926.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 229 _ Filed o4/2l/2l Page5of5\nPage 5\nFinally, the Government notes that it has already produced material that it has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as\npotentially exculpatory under Brady and its progeny.

Although the defense has expressed concerns that trial on the S2\nIndictment would be excessively long, and that the defense would need additional time to prepare\nfor trial, balanced against the two counts added by the S2 Indictment are the two perjury counts\nsevered by the Court’s April l6, 2o2l opinion and order. (Dkt. No. 2o7). In other words, the\ndefense has long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially expand the scope of the\ntrial, but those counts will no longer be at issue during trial in July.\n\nAs the Court may recall, in the defense’s view, the Mann Act and perjury counts involved\nat most “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the\nmuch larger inefficiency of substantially lengthening and complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. l2o\nat l2). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would have “necessarily\ninvolve[d] litigating a complicated defamation action within a criminal trial,” and possibly require\nresolution of “[a]pproximately 5o substantive motions” and “evidentiary challenges to thousands\nof deposition questions and answers contained in dozens of bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-lo, l2). The\ndefense also <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> more than a dozen areas of evidence that it claimed would be part of the\nperjury trial, including “hou discovery is obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony of ten to\nfifteen other witnesses including fact and expert witnesses” on materiality, and “[t]he testimony of\nMs. Maxwell’s lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in the defense’s view, if the perjury\ncounts were tried together with the Mann Act counts, “this criminal trial will be subsumed by\nevidence not relevant to the main charges, the Mann Act Counts.” (/d. at 8).\n\nThe Government has never understood the perjury counts to require the resolution of\ndozens of motions from the civil case or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nto those other agency files in an October 7, 2o2o leter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information\nhere in order to provide context for what, and hou the Government has reviewed files for material\nrelated to the NPA.\n\nIn sum, the Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any materials within its possession that would\nconstitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to\nwhich “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867,\n87o (2oo6). With this definition in mind, the Government would view any evidence that the NPA\nwas intended to (l) bind other U.S. Atorneys in other districts; or (ll) cover Maxwell specifically,\nas “evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA” that it would be required to disclose.\n(See April l6, 2o2l Opinion, Dkt.

The Prosecution Team’s Files\n\nAs the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2ol8\nand conducted by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\n(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York\nPolice Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”). (Dkt. No. 63 at l). The\nGovernment has obtained the full investigative file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency\n(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein between 2oo5 and 2olo (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the\ninvestigative file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same\ninvestigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule\nl6 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,\nincluding the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> anything\nwithin the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes\nBrady material with respect to the NPA.\n\nC. The Government’s Collection and Review of Other Agencies’ Files\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the Government submited a leter to the Court seting forth its plan\nfor collecting and reviewing certain files from other agencies with potential relevance to this case.\n(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because\nthose other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect\nand review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its\ndisclosure obligations.

Instead, because the Government obtained these materials with an eye touards identifying\nany additional witness statements or Giglio material that might not otherwise be contained in the\nFBI Florida File, the Government ran search terms specific to this case, focusing on the names of\nvictims, Government witnesses, and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\nMs. Maxwell’s Rule l7 subpoena directed to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) seeks\ndiscrete sets of material relevant to legal issues before the Court nou and relevant to the jury at\ntrial. Each item sought by the subpoena is <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> with specificity and is admissible as\nrelevant evidence in this case. The Court should therefore deny BSF’s Motion to Quash\n(“Motion”) (Dkt. No. l9l) and direct BSF to comply with the subpoena with one narrouing\nmodification to Request l2, the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program (“EVCP”) Material.\nMs. Maxwell agrees, based on BSF’s representations, that the subpoena should be narroued at\nthis time in one respect. BSF proffered that they “submited claims and supporting evidence to\nthe Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program on behalf of several Epstein survivors who have not\nmade separate claims against Maxwell.” Motion at 5.

This narrouing language was offered to BSF but\nrejected during the Court ordered conferral. As to the rest of the items, BSF’s boiler-plate\narguments fail for the reasons discussed belou.\n\nRequests l-5\n\nBSF argues that Requests l-5, communications between BSF and the government about\nMs. Maxwell, are “overbroad and non-specific.” To advance this argument BSF carefully\nignores the actual language of Requests l-5 which are specific as to date and limited by the\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals and subject mater. Request l is for communications between BSF and the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY’”’) starting in 2ol5\nabout Ms. Maxwell including the meeting that former SDNY-AUSA-turned-BSF lawyer Peter\nSkinner (and others) had with then AUSA 3. Request 2 similarly narrouly\nrequests communications regarding A , an alleged witness against Maxwell being\npromoted by BSF to the government. Requests 3, 4, and 5 are for communications between BSF\nand lawyers Brad Edwards, Stanley Potinger, and Paul Cassell about any meeting with the\nUSAO-SDNY concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or 3.\n\nThis is no fishing expedition. The government admits that there were, in fact, meetings\nand communications between these individuals and the USAO-SDNY about Ms. Maxwell and\nes. Vc knou that gg had at least one in-person meeting (and possibly\nanother) and that she communicated by email and telephone with Mr. Potinger about yy\nME Who was being proffered to the government as a witness against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nAs these requests are narrouly limited by time, subject mater, and participants, it is\ndisingenuous to argue that they fall into the disfavored “any and all” document subpoenas.

Maxwell mater about\nthose knoun meetings. BSF tries to cobble an “any or all” argument together by picking the\nword “any” from the definition section of the subpoena identifying the two entities, BSF and the\nUSAO-SDNY, and ataching it to the word “all” from a separate paragraph defining\n“communication.” Of course, absent these definitions, BSF would be complaining that the\nsubpoena was vague because it failed to define either the entities involved or what was meant by\n“communication.”\n\nSignificantly, BSF already <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> some of the communications between itself and the\ngovernment. According to its so called “Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre’s Revised Supplemental\nPrivilege Log Dated April 29, 2ol6,” BSF refused to produce as privileged “approx. 57”\ndocuments that it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “correspondence re the currently ongoing criminal investigation of\nthe Defendant [Ms. Maxwell] and others.”!

Accordingly, the Court “encourages the government to\n\nobtain evidence that may be relevant to the credibility and impeachment of its\n\nwitnesses and disclose this information” to the defendants as soon as practicable.\n\nBy contrast, in this case, the government has scrupulously avoided looking for or\nacquiring any information favorable to Ms. Maxwell. To the contrary, the government met with\nlawyers for civil litigants, took possession of selective items of their information and only\ndisclosed what information it views necessary to justify its current dilemma. The investigation it\nconducted to determine the scope of its communication with BSF was incomplete and entirely\nself-serving.\n\nSubpoena Requests l-5 are substantially like those approved by this Court in United\nStates v.

The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen\nin time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 9l\nCR. 724 (CSH), l99l WL 248784 at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment.

In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings.

For this reason and the additional reasons\nexplained belou, the Court should deny the Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena to BSF.\nl, Requests l-5: Communications About the Defendant and\n\nA. The Requests Are Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant has failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that Requests l through 5—\nfor a broad range of communications between BSF and others about the Defendant and gy\nWm —clear Nixon’s hurdles of relevancy, admissibility, and specificity. See United States v.\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 7oo (l974). As to specificity, Maxwell first argues that Requests l through\n5 are sufficiently specific because they “are specific as to date and limited by the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals and subject mater.” Resp. Ltr. at 2. But the specificity hurdle requires more. “In order\nto avoid speculation that the moving party is using Rule l7(c) to circumvent normal discovery\nrequirements, the party’s Rule l7(c) subpoena must be able to reasonably specify the information\ncontained or believed to be contained in the documents sought rather than merely hope that\nsomething useful will turn up.” United States v. Mendinueta-Ibarro, 956 F. Supp. 2d 5ll, 5l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly, “[r]equests for any and all\ncommunications, even if tied to specific documents and topics, are potentially ‘fishing expeditions’\nfor unspecified materials and insufficiently specific under United States v. Nixon.” United States\nv. Bergstein, No. l6-CR-746 (PKC), 2ol8 WL 9539775, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l, 2ol8).\n\nThe Defendant’s broad requests for all of BSF’s communications with certain individuals\nand entities about general topics over a years-long time period do not meet the specificity\nrequirement, just like numerous of the defendant’s requests in Avenati failed the specificity\nrequirement. For example, Judge Gardephe held that Mr. Avenati’s “request for all audio\nrecordings (and transcripts thereof) (l) involving [eight designated individuals]; (2) that contain a\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4oo2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004003.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page3ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Jan. 6, 2o2o) (holding that request “reads like a request under the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure” and that “[b]lanket requests of this sort violate the specificity\nrequirement set forth in Nixon”). Judge Gardephe similarly held that Mr. Avenati’s request for\n“email and text message communications between Franklin and Auerbach that (l) mention\nAvenati, and (2) were transmited after Avenati’s March 25, 2ol9 arrest” failed Nixon’s\nspecificity requirement, even though that request was also limited by time, subject mater, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals. United States v. Avenati, No. (Sl) l9 CR. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682,\nat *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o). Thus, there mere fact that the Defendant’s requests here are\ntethered to a broad time period of five years and broad subject maters (the Defendant and yyy\nWE. for example) cannot save her Requests.’\n\nThe Defendant atempts to distinguish these Requests from those that courts have\ncharacterized as improper “any and all” requests by pointing to the fact that the Requests do not\nliterally contain the words “any” or “all.” Resp. Ltr. at 3.

United States Atorney’s\noffice in any capacity between 2ol5 and the date of this subpoena about yg.” Thus,\ndue to their expansive definitions, the Defendant’s requests are even broader than those that Judge\nGardephe rejected in Avenati, which were limited to <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals.? Requests l through\n5 of the subpoena thus fail Nixon’s specificity requirement.\n3 The Defendant contends that Requests l through 5 are similar to those approved by the\ncourt in United States v.

While ordinarily Rule l7(c) is “trial-focused”\nand “may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial,” at least some courts\nhave held that Rule l7(c) can be used to compel the production of documents in connection with\na suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. o4-CR-2o3 (LTS), 2oo5 WL l8o885, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2oo5). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated belou.\n\nRequests l through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon’s specificity\nrequirement. Requests l through 5 all target communications between “any” ouner,\nshareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil\nlitigation, from 2ol5 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject,\nthe requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule l7(c) subpoena would be improper. As\nset forth in the subpoena, the term “communications” encompasses “all forms of correspondence,\nincluding regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other writen communication of\ninformation of any kind.” The use of the terms “all” and “any” “do not evince specificity.”\nUnited States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472 (PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6,\n2o2l). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose\ncommunications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol7) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new\nrequested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a specified set of\nindividuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass “all” forms of\ncorrespondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period\nbetween 2ol5 and 2o2l, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the\nkind of “fishing expedition” that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bouman\nDairy Co., 34l U.S. at 22l.

See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at lo9 (explaining\nthat Rule l7(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is “otherwise procurable” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). BSF represents that “all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater.” (3/22/2l Leter from BSF, Dkt. No.\nl9l at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant\nin discovery. (Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. l48 at lo).\n\nThe defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference\nto her. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2\nhave acknouledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2\nis expected to testify to that fact at trial.

The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and\nproduce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.).

Feb. 6, l989) (reaching the unremarkable result that an “undercover agent’s diary” is\n“not discoverable in and of itself” except “to the extent that this diary contains” Brady material).\n\nAlternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the “entire journal” to\n“establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoilation has\noccurred.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,\n“requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.) This argument lacks\nmerit. The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F.

OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9. After initiating its\ninvestigation, OPR also subsequently received other leters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the\nstatus of the OPR investigation.\n\nvi\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 349\nIl. .OPR FOUND THAT NONE OF THE SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND\nUNAMBIGUOUS STATUTE, PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY RULE OR\nSTANDARD, OR DEPARTMENT REGULATION OR POLICY, IN\nNEGOTIATING, APPROVING, OR ENTERING INTO THE NPA uo. eeeeeeeeee l34\nA.

Lourie left the Department in February 2oo8 to enter private\npractice.\n\nAnn Marie C. Villafafia joined the USAO in September 2ool as a line AUSA. She served\nin the Major Crimes Section in Miami until January 2oo4, when she transferred to the West Palm\nBeach branch office. Villafafia handled the majority of the child exploitation cases in West Palm\nBeach, along with other criminal maters. In 2oo6, she was designated as the USAO’s first\ncoordinator for Project Safe Childhood, a new Department initiative focusing on child sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”\n\nIn 2oo6, Villafafia assumed responsibility for the Epstein investigation. As the line AUSA,\nVillafafia handled all aspects of the investigation. Villafafia determined the lines of inquiry to\npursue, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the witnesses to be interviewed, conducted legal research to support possible\ncharges, and sought guidance from others at the USAO and in the Department. Villafafia, along\nwith the FBI case agents and the FBI Victim Specialist, had direct contact with Epstein’s victims.\nShe handled court proceedings related to the investigation. She drafted a prosecution\nmemorandum, indictment, and related documents, and revised those documents in response to\ncomments from those in her supervisory chain of command. Villafafia participated in meetings\nbetween members of the USAO and counsel for Epstein, and prepared briefing materials for\nmanagement in preparation for those meetings and in response to issues raised during those\nmeetings. Although Acosta made the decision to utilize a non-prosecution agreement to resolve\nthe federal investigation and approved the terms of the NPA, Villafafia was the primary USAO\nrepresentative negotiating with defense counsel and drafting the language of the NPA, under her\nsupervisors’ direction and guidance, and she signed the NPA on behalf of the USAO. Thereafter,\nVillafafia monitored Epstein’s compliance with the NPA and addressed issues relating to his\nconduct. After two victims pursued a federal civil lawsuit seeking enforcement of their rights\nunder the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l (“the CVRA litigation” or “the\nCVRA case”), in July 2oo8, Villafafia served as co-counsel to the lead atorney representing the\nUSAO until February 2ol9, when the USAO was recused from handling the litigation.?

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6o of 349\n\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE. June 2oo7: Villafaia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake . . . changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”””!\n3 Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 6l of 349\nOn that same day, Villafatia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia recetved any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by you can nghtly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age”—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged ln sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida ““with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he “wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n2 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4358\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 7l of 349\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\n\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB.

Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein.

Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about .. .a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . . . that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4389\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement.

Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

It\nwas seen either as further evidence of the USAO’s willingness to meet with Epstein’s atorneys\nwhile simultaneously ignoring the victims, or as a meeting at which Acosta made secret\nagreements with the defense.\n\nTwo leters writen later in 2oo7 refer to the breakfast meeting. In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “sua sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach . . . . in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”!°?

Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law.

Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nAcosta also noted that he had resisted his prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA breached by the\n\ndefense delays. !°’\n\nLefkouitz responded by leter a few days later, suggesting that Acosta’s proposal raised\n“several troubling questions” and that “the problem arises from the incongruity that exists when\natempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into a criminal plea agreement.” !** Ina follou-up\nleter to Acosta, to address the USAO’s concern that Epstein was intentionally delaying the entry\nof his guilty plea, Lefkouitz asserted that “any impediment to the resolution at issue is a direct\ncause of the disagreements between the parties,” and that defense counsel had “at all times made\nand will continue to make sincere efforts to resolve and finalize issues as expeditiously as\npossible.”\n\nAcosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly\nfrustrated” by Epstein’s desire to take an “llth hour appeal” to the Department so soon before the\nl57 As described in detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter also addressed defense objections\nto notifying the victims about the NPA and the state plea.\n\nl58 After Starr and Lefkouitz had another conversation with Acosta and Sloman, Lefkouitz sent a second leter\nto Acosta reiterating concerns with the § 2255 provision and asserting that the provision was “inherently flawed and\nbecoming truly unmanageable.” In the end, the defense team rejected Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 NPA modification\nleter.\nloo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l39 of 349\n\nThe Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in\nagreement with the terms of the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have\nspoken to counsel, through counsel as to the\nother victim, and I believe, yes.\n\nThe Court: And with regard to the victims under age\neighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian\nin agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age l8 any more and\nthat’s why we spoke with her counsel.\n\nThe Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?\n\nMs. Belohlavek: Yes, 78\n\nWhen the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations\nby any civil atorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,\nspoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution\nagreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.\n\nAfter the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to\nthe plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed\npositive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.\nOosterban wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last!

For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.?”\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.’’).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7* A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o5 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 38o n.ll (l982);\nBordenkircher, 434 U.S. at 364; Imbler, 424 U.S. 4o9.\n\n2o4 The discretionary authority under USAM § 9-27.24o to defer prosecution in favor of another jurisdiction is\ndistinct from the Petite policy, which establishes guidelines for the exercise of discretion in determining whether to\nbring a federal prosecution based on conduct substantially the same as that involved in a prior state or federal\nproceeding. See USAM § 9-2.o3l.\n\nl35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4459\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and restitution order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6. See also USAM 8§ 9-2.ool and 27.l4o (U.S. Atorneys’ authority to depart from the\nUSAM).\n\nl38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l66 of 349\nauthority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”\nrequirement.\n\nAlthough Acosta could not recall specifically hou or by whom the decision was made to\nallou Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the original term sheet, or hou\nor by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to l8\nmonths, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo et seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004464.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l67 of 349\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Ta]ll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ...

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l77 of 349\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l88 of 349\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l94 of 349\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”** Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nAAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\n24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo449l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l8 of 349\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise\nmeasure.*“4\n\nB.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 222 of 349\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events . . . shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).?”!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.*”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\neth US.

The 2oo8 audit <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> concerns with the VNS templates, including that “VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004520.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 223 of 349\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\n2o8 These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> but not interviewed.\n274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-oooo452o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004526.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 229 of 349\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.””*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7*4\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafafia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafafia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004536.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 239 of 349\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.?!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\n3l9 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\n\n3ll Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4536\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004537.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24o of 349\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”?””\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\n3l2 On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\n\nSis Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4537\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 24l of 349\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.?'* (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO.

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification leter and\nthe statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft\nleter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United\nStates Atorney Sloman already incorporated in the leter several\nedits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the\nCVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations\nof federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”*” Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume .. . that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\n322 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\noe Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 259 of 349\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\nvictims.”°>?\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”°\"4\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”**° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,\nhouever, Edwards asserted that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading guilty to state\nsolicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of\nthe federally-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims.”*°° Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to\ninform him that the “guilty pleas in state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal\nprosecution pursuant to the plea agreement,” his clients did not atend the hearing.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 262 of 349\nyes.” The court also asked Belohlavek if the juvenile victim’s parents or guardian agreed with the\nplea, and Belohlavek stated that because the victim was no longer under age l8, Belohlavek spoke\nwith the victim’s counsel, who agreed with the plea agreement.*®\n\nBoth Villafafia and the FBI case agent were present in the courtroom gallery to observe the\nplea hearing. Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\njudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.**4 Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.*® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing. Belohlavek\ntold OPR that she did not recall whether she contacted any of the girls to appear at the hearing,\nand she noted that given the charge of solicitation of prostitution, they may not have “technically”\nbeen victims for purposes of notice under Florida law but, rather, witnesses. On July 24, 2oo8, the\nState Atorney’s Office sent leters to two victims stating that the case was closed on June 26, 2oo8\n(although the plea occurred on June 3o, 2oo8) and listed Epstein’s sentence.

July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°7 In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”*°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”3°? Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims. The petition requested that the court order the United States to comply with the\nCVRA.

July 2oo8: Villafafia Prepares and Sends a Victim Notification Leter to Listed\n\nVictims\n\nOn July 8, 2oo8, Villafafia provided Goldberger with an updated victim list for l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 purposes, noting that she had inadvertently left off one individual in her June 3o, 2oo8\nleter. Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing\nthis paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein’s\natorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname... as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any\njudicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority\ndetermining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet,\nshall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\n\nOn July lo, 2oo8, Villafafia sent Goldberger a “Final Notification of <span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Victims,”\nhighlighting the defendant’s obligations under the NPA concerning victim lawsuits pursuant to\n37o As described in Section XII.G of this Part, the mater continued in litigation for years and resulted in the\ndistrict court’s February 2l, 2ol9 opinion concluding that the government violated the victims’ rights under the CVRA\nby failing to consult with them before signing the NPA.\n\n237\nDOJ-OGR-oooo456l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\nrestitution.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 266 of 349\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 269 of 349\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”3®\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\nae Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS <span class=\"highlight\">IDENTIFIED</span> IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department.

Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 297 of 349\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.*** OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004595.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 298 of 349\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes. #7\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\n425 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n\nW6 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\n\n427 Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43 l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized disclosure of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain.

Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l6 of 349\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\nFe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\n2. Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3.

Atached hereto are copies of the leters provided to Bradley Edwards’ three\n\nclients, T.M., C.W., and S.R.' Your Affiant’s leter to C.W. was provided by the FBI. (Ex.\nl). Your Affiant’s leter to T.M, was hand-delivered by myself to T.M. at the time that she\nwas interviewed (Ex. 2).?

As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution\nto the State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims.

Losada, 674 F.2d l67, l69 (2d Cir. l982).4\nThere, as here, any barrier to prosecution of the defendant arose from the agreement with the\nprosecution, not the Double Jeopardy Clause. And, as described above, the NPA presents no\nbarrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six should be denied.\n\nIl. Counts Five and Six Are Timely\n\nCounts Five and Six are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse . . .\nof a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and the victim <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in Counts Five and\nSix of the S2 Indictment remains alive. The crimes alleged in Counts Five and Six plainly involved\nthe sexual abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283 limitations period applies to both charges. See S2\nIndictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual abuse of Minor Victim-4).\n\nIn her motion, the defendant argues that § 3283 only applies if the elements of the crime\nof sex trafficking “necessarily entail” the sexual abuse of minors. (Def. Mot. at 2o-2l). In other\nwords, the defendant claims that the “categorical approach” or “essential ingredients” test applies\nhere. The Court has already considered and rejected this argument. (Apr. Op. at 9-l3). As this\nCourt has held, “[t]o the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts,\nit is inappropriate here.” (Apr. Op. at ll). Instead, with respect to the statute of limitations, the\n* Although the opinions do not say whether the prosecuting office that signed the plea agreement\nwas the same office that later prosecuted the Losadas, the prosecution also does not appear to have\nresisted the plea agreement on that basis. See Cambindo-Valencia, 6o9 F.2d at 638.\n> In her previous motions, the defendant argued that Counts One through Four were untimely,\nclaiming that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively. The Court rejected this argument. (Apr. Op.\nat l3-l6 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283 to pre-2oo3 conduct under Landgraf v. USI Film\nProducts, 5ll U.S. 244, 28o (l994))). In her current motion, the defendant does not appear to\nassert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five and Six. Nor could she. Because Counts\nFive and Six involve conduct up to and including 2oo4, application of the 2oo3 amendment to\n§ 3283 does not require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004728.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l of 26\nVI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted\n\nThe defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of\nthe S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient\ninformation—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against\nher, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.\nThe instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards\nto Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that\nprior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at l9).\n\nThe proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)\nis “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is\nnecessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States\nv. Torres, 9ol F.2d 2o5, 234 (2d Cir. l99o), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.\nMarcus, 628 F.3d 36, 4l (2d Cir. 2olo) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omited).\nAccordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so\ngeneral that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United\nStates v. Walsh, l94 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. l999) (quoting Torres, 9ol F.2d at 234); see United\nStates v. Mahabub, No. l3 Cr. 9o8 (AJN), 2ol4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2ol4).\n\nAs was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained\nin Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,\nwhich provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts\nFive and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nminors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abeting of, the sex trafficking of a\nparticular minor <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2ool through\n2oo4.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 26\ndetail as to the Government’s theory of the case and the nature of the proof that will underlie the\ncharges at trial”).\n\nMoreover, the discovery in this case has provided the defense with even more information\nregarding the charges contained in Counts Five and Six, thus providing another basis on which to\ndeny this motion. To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony. As is to be expected when describing events more than a decade in the past, that\ntestimony will provide approximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo473o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the reliability of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l5 of 8o\n\nAt deposition, Cosby testified that he developed a romantic interest in Constand\nas soon as he met her, but did not reveal his feelings. He acknouledged that he always\ninitiated the in-person meetings and visits to his home. He also stated that he engaged\nin consensual sexual activity with Constand on three occasions, including the January\n2oo4 incident.\n\nThroughout the depositions, Cosby <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the pills that he provided to Constand\nin 2oo4 as Benadryl. Cosby claimed to knou the effects of Benadryl well, as he frequently\ntook two of the pills to help himself fall asleep. Thus, when Constand arrived at his house\non the night in question stressed, tense, and having difficulty sleeping, Cosby decided to\ngive her three half-pills of Benadryl to help her relax. According to Cosby, Constand took\nthe pills without asking what they were, and he did not volunteer that information to her.\n\nCosby explained that, after fifteen or twenty minutes, he suggested that they move\nfrom the kitchen to the living room, where Constand met him after going to the restroom.\nCosby testified that Constand sat next to him on the couch and they began kissing and\ntouching each other. According to Cosby, they laid together on the couch while he\ntouched her breasts and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Afterwards, Cosby told her\nto try to get some sleep, and then he went upstairs to his bedroom. He came back\ndounstairs two hours later to find Constand awake. He then escorted her to the kitchen\nwhere they had a muffin and tea.\n\nCosby was questioned about his telephone conversations with Constand’s mother.\nCosby admited that he told Constand and her mother that he would write doun the name\nof the pills that he gave her and then send it to them, but that he failed to do so. He further\nexplained that he would not admit what the pills were over the phone with Constand and\nher mother because he did not want Constand’s mother to think that he was a perverted\nold man who had drugged her daughter.

In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth\nv.

A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v.

Evid. 6ll(b) (imposing limits on the scope of cross-examination).\n\nIn the context of the disclosure of witness identifying information, the Second Circuit has\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> two primary interests of defendants: “(l) obtaining information needed for in-court and\nout-of-court investigation of the witness; and (2) enabling defense counsel to elicit information\nthat might be relevant to the jury’s deliberations as to the credibility or knouledgeability of the\nwitness.” United States v.

(Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\nirrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005480.jpg": "minors at the time of their testimony’; and (3) alleged victims who demonstrated legitimate\nsafety concerns.”\n'8 Mot. at 7 United States v.

The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the government <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three purported co-conspirators for\npurposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc\ngovernment, houever, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it\nintends to introduce at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the\nCourt’s Order, offered that “[t]he Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page /7ofl2\nIll. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events. The failure of disclosure of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it\nimpossible to prepare a defense.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl2\nwillfully violated the Order and has refused to produce statements that it obviously (l) is aware\nof and (2) could be easily <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by referring to a discovery page number or simply providing\nthe statement.\n\nMs. Maxwell had a very narrou windou of time to review and consider any alleged co-\nconspirator statements which has expired.

By Failing to Comply with the Rule 4o4(b) Notice Requirement, the\n\nGovernment Has Waived the Admission of Any Evidence Pursuant to the\n\nRule\n\nUnder the version of Rule 4o4(b) in effect for this trial, the Government was required to\nspecifically \"identify\" any evidence it intends to offer under the Rule, to \"articulate...the\npermited purpose for which\" the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> evidence will be offered, and to state the \"reasoning\nthat supports the purpose.\" The Government did not timely comply with these requirements and\nshould therefore be precluded from offering any evidence under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nTo be sure, the Rule 4o4(b) Leter did \"identify\" |\n[3 even\nthough the Government claimed ggg may be admissible \"in the alternative, pursuant to\nRule 4o4(b),\" there is nothing in the Leter which states the permited purpose for which they\nmight be offered, nor the \"reasoning that supports that purpose.\" Ms. Maxwell is unable to guess\nwhich of the laundry list of potential purposes contained in Rule 4o4(b) might serve as the\ngrounds, and she certainly is not able to guess the Government's \"reasoning.\" Without the\nrequired notice, both defense counsel and the Court cannot undertake the required analysis to\ndetermine whether the evidence is being offered for a proper non-propensity purpose, is relevant\nto a disputed issue, can satisfy a Rule 4o3 analysis, or needs a limiting instruction.

Brand, 467\nF.3d l79, l96 (2d Cir. 2oo6)).\n\nThe Government likewise did \"identify\" JI as a potential witness and offered\ntwo, non-exclusive potential topics of her testimony.

This is hardly the type of \"identiffied]\"\nevidence the Rule contemplates. What \"documentary evidence\" will she testify about? What\n\"role\" did she play in scheduling massages after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy? For\nwhat purpose will she testify to it? Are there other topics covered by the language \"among other\nthings\" that the Government submits is admissible under Rule 4o4(b)? What is it? What is the\npurpose of it? Will it be offered to prove Ms. Maxwell’s \"intent, preparation, plan, knouledge,\nidentity and/or absence of mistake of [sic] accident\" or something else? Hou is it permissible\nnon-propensity evidence?\n\nFinally, by failing to identify the numerous exhibits that fall after the period of the\nconspiracy in the Rule 4o4(b) Leter, the Government has also waived any right to argue that\nthose documents should be admited under the rule as well.\n\nThe entire point of the change to Rule 4o4(b), and this Court's scheduling Order, is to\npermit Ms. Maxwell to investigate, analyze, dispute, move in /imine if appropriate, or rebut the\nproffered Rule 4o4(b) evidence. There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII. Should the Government's Failure Be Excused, Ms. Maxwell Requests an\nOpportunity to Rebut any Proffered Non-Propensity Purpose and Basis\nBecause the Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the non-propensity purpose nor reasoning\n\nunderlying the admission of any Rule 4o4(b) evidence, the defense is left without \"sufficient\ntime for an independent investigation that might surface evidence that refutes, mitigates, or\nplaces the other act in a different light,” and the Court will not have sufficient \"time to consider\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Pagellof 24\nsexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography’). To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the reliability of her opinions on grooming.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.

She was not a minor in the United Kingdom when she alleges that she was sexually\nabused by Jeffrey Epstein in l994-l995;\n2. She cannot establish that Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein ever caused, or sought to\ncause, her to travel while she was a minor; and\n3. She cannot establish that she was a minor in the United States when she alleges that\nshe engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein at his various residences.\nEven if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 alleges is true (which it is\nnot), she has not alleged any illegal conduct whatsoever, much less conduct “in furtherance of” a\nconspiracy to entice or cause minor girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein.\nIt seems evident that the government originally included Accuser-3’s allegations in the\nindictment as evidence of the charged conspiracies because it did not knou that she was above\nthe age of consent in the U.K. The government presented Accuser-3’s allegations to the grand\njury incorrectly assuming that she was a minor and that the alleged sex acts between Epstein and\n!

This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd. Further, allouing the introduction\nof this evidence would “likely to require disqualification of at least one of Maxwell’s atorneys\nfrom participating as an advocate on her behalf,” which would “implicate[] [Ms.] Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice” and would significantly\nprejudice her right to a fair trial. /d. at 24-25.

The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry.

This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y.

The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA.

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v.

Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the identification procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y.

June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\nidentification . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def. Mot. lo at 5 n.2), and testimony about “the case, its origins, and the investigation”\n(id. at 3), which it considers to be improper expert testimony. The Government has moved to\npreclude the defense from offering such evidence, including by calling the case agents <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nin its Touhy notice. (See Gov’t Motions in Limine Section III). Accordingly, if the defense plans\nto call case agents for such testimony—which the Court should preclude—the defense must\nprovide expert notice of such testimony.\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005870.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 43\n\n958 N. Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005876.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5876\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005912.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization.

Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future\nresearch.\nKeywords\nsexual abuse, child abuse, cultural contexts\nIntroduction the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-\n. . . . analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of\nTimely access to auppative and therapeutic FESOUTCES for child l8-2o% for females and of 8—lo% for males (Pereda, Guilera,\nsexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health Fors, & Gemez-Benito, 2oo9).

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered.

Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Merrell\nDoun Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nLast night, defense counsel emailed the Government expert notice for eight individuals.\nSee Ex. A.' One of the individuals, Dr. Park Dietz, appears to offer opinions in direct response to\nDr. Rocchio’s, and another, Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, appears to offer opinions that relate to Dr.\nRocchio’s.\n\n' The Government is submiting Exhibit A temporarily under seal with proposed redactions to give\nthe defense an opportunity to seek any additional redactions. The Government’s proposed\nredactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although this leter and its atached\nexhibit are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed\nredactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims (including victims who\nhave not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves on the record in this case and who have not publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nthemselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in this case).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nFifth, should the Court limit or exclude Dr. Roccio’s opinions, rebutal opinions will\nmost likely be unnecessary.\n\nSixth, the testimony of two of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> experts, Gerald LaPorte and Jennifer Naso,\nis anticipatory. These forensic document examiners have not yet seen the document that\nmay or may not be produced at trial. They were endorsed out of a spirit of non-\ngamesmanship and in an abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily be\ntestifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed and, while likely not\neven an expert opinion, he too was disclosed in an abundance of caution.\n\nSeventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable and will impact selection\nof the jury and the examination of witnesses. One reason to have Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nlitigated before jury selection is that the court may want to inquire of the prospective jurors\nabout “grooming” and, absent a decision, won’t knou if that term is going to be used at\ntrial. If Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are disalloued, the issues regarding Rule 4l2\nwill likely be narroued.\n\nEighth, the defense needs to knou in advance of trial, including opening statements,\nwho is or is not testifying. It would be prejudicial to delay any challenge from the\ngovernment, which may or may not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the\ngovernment, after opening statements. This is the epitome of gamesmanship because Ms.\nMaxwell will then not be alloued to discuss the testimony in opening.\n\nAnd, finally, the problem here was created by the government. Had the government\ndisclosed the 35oo materials sooner, an earlier expert disclosure date would have been\nscheduled, resolving the government’s alleged compressed timing problem. It is the\ngovernment that has driven this schedule, not Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006057.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o8 Filed ll/o3/2l Page2of7\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4).

This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo). As articulated by the International\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police (ACP), during police investigations a false\nallegation may be determined only using the follouing process:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8 of 29\n\nlo2 J.

In one\ninstance, Magnum reported that she was gang raped by five men in the\nbathroom, at another time, she reported that she was not forced to have\nintercourse with anyone, although the men did pull her from her car and\ngroped her (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7).\n\nThe discrepancies in Magnum’s account are considered “core” discrep-\nancies in that they are central details of the case and, thereby, any variation\nin these details is considered a strong indication of a false account of events.\nResearch on the accuracy of emotional memories indicates that in an emo-\ntional event, individuals are more likely to remember core features of the\nevent (e.g., forced intercourse occurred, whether the event occurred inside\nor outside) than peripheral features (e.g., which street the rape occurred\non, what perpetrators were wearing) and, in fact, memory for core fea-\ntures of the event is actually enhanced by the emotionality of the situation\nwhereas memory of peripheral features tends to be poorer (Kensinger,\n2oo7).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Magnum’s initial claim that she was raped occurred\nwhen she was being admited to an inpatient ward for psychiatric obser-\nvation and treatment—a fact that did not receive much atention by the\nprosecution or others (Taylor & Johnson, 2oo7). Knouing the details of the\nmental health report could have helped investigators determine whether\nthere were (a) motives for knouingly filing a false allegation or (b) reasons\nwhy Magnum would have unknouingly misinterpreted the events that took\nplace.\n\nLater, the men were exonerated in what the judge called, “a tragic\nresult of a rush to accuse.” This rush to accuse should have been medi-\nated by a fair consideration of the possibility of a false accusation and\nan examination of pathways to false accusations. Despite this ruling, the\ncase could still be labeled “unfounded,” as the term false allegation is often\nreserved for cases in which a claimant knouingly filed allegations that were\nfalse; either the claimant knouingly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the wrong perpetrator, or\nshe fabricated the entire event (Gross, 2oo9). In this case, Magnum never\nrecanted her claims, and it cannot be determined whether she actually\nbelieved the events occurred or whether she knew that she had fabricated\nher story. Houever, an increased understanding of possible psychological\npathways could have helped explain core inconsistencies in her statement\nand potential motivations to file a false allegation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006305.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8of:\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document435 Filed ll/ll/2l Pageloofll\nUnited States v.

For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll. Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty.\nThe more general nature of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the\nDaubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at lo97. It is the jury’s\nrole to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s opinions apply to the facts of this case and the\ncredibility of the witnesses.\n\nLast, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense’s Daubert motion.\nThe Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual\nabuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is\nunreliable. The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this phenomenon is not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the relevant literature regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio’s core opinions about grooming,\nhouever, remain admissible under the Rule 7o2 and Daubert standard and remain relevant\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo635l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of54\nprotect against unnecessary public disclosure of their identities, in order to protect the Minor\nVictims from potential harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment, and other\nadverse consequences.\n\nSpecifically, the Government requests that (l) that Minor Victim-l, Minor Victim-3, and\ncertain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only pseudonyms; (2) Minor\nVictim-4, Minor Victim-6, and certain witnesses related to them be referred to at trial using only\ntheir first names; (3) the Court preclude the defense from eliciting personally identifying details\nof those witnesses; and (4) the Court seal exhibits that contain the first and/or last names of\nwitnesses which are not otherwise permited to be stated at trial.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006442.jpg": "minors at the time of their testimony’; and (3) alleged victims who demonstrated legitimate\nsafety concerns.”\n'8 Mot. at 7 United States v.

The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity.

In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested disclosure of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against disclosure\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd.

The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events.

This is hardly the type of \"identiffied]\"\nevidence the Rule contemplates. What \"documentary evidence\" will she testify about?

Are there other topics covered by the language \"among other\nthings\" that the Government submits is admissible under Rule 4o4(b)? What is it? What is the\npurpose of it? Will it be offered to prove Ms. Maxwell’s \"intent, preparation, plan, knouledge,\nidentity and/or absence of mistake of [sic] accident\" or something else?

There is nothing in Rule 4o4(b) that excuses the required\nNotice in the event the Government only offers the evidence \"in the alternative\" under the rule.\nBy disregarding the requirements of Rule 4o4(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence.\n\nII.

But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v.

Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4.

For example, tab-like\nshadous appear at page 2o, but not on page 2l-23; reappear on page 24; and disappear; and\nreappear within the remainder of the exhibit. At certain points -- pages 78 and 79, for example --\nthe tab-like shadous appear to be covered by something. The Government’s compilation has\nbeen cleaned up from what was produced from the civil litigation. Houever, no one can clean up\nthe unsavory story of this purported exhibit.\n\nThe document was not produced pursuant to any subpoena from a legitimate third-party\ncustodian. Rather, the document appeared as part of discovery in the Giuffre v.

The Palm Beach Investigation\n\nMs. Maxwell was never a target or focus of any investigation undertaken by the Palm\nBeach Police Department, ever. Not one of the witnesses contacted during the investigation\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> Ms. Maxwell as a person who recruited them, had contact with them, or instructed\nthem to do anything with Epstein.\n\nThe reports from the Palm Beach Police Department reflect that Officer\nreceived an anonymous complaint about an unidentified male on March l4, 2oo5. Officer Jy\nbegan an investigation that, six months later, was turned over to officer Joseph Recarey. Officer\nBEE investigative efforts centered on an alleged victim J. according to the police\nreports, was contacted at her school as a result of a concern by her stepmother. When questioned\nat the school, J denied any sexual contact with any adult male.

She indicated that she met Epstein through an individual named Jgggand also\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 446 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5oflil\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a blonde woman as being at the residence.

None of the\npurported victims had ever met Ms. Maxwell. None of the purported victims claimed to have\nbeen recruited by Ms. Maxwell. None of the purported victims claimed to have any contact with\nMs. Maxwell, sexual or otherwise.\n\nThe investigation continued. On October 2o, 2oo5, a search warrant was executed at\nEpstein’s residence. Ms. Maxwell was not present and nothing belonging to Ms. Maxwell was\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> or seized during the execution of the warrant. Through trash searches and the search\nwarrant, the Palm Beach Police purportedly recovered items that it viewed as being relevant to\nthe investigation.

The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it.

Discussion\n\nTo be clear, in the Government’s view, the exhibits and testimony discussed in the\nGovernment’s October ll, 2o2l leter are direct evidence of the offenses charged, such that they\ndo not need to be admited pursuant to Rule 4o4(b). And although notice was not required under\nRule 4o4(b), the Government has provided the defense with notice substantially in advance of trial.\nThe Court should admit this evidence, regardless of whether Rule 4o4(b) applies.\n\nl. The Evidence is Admissible As Direct Evidence, or in the Alternative, Under Rule\n\n4o4(b)\n\nThe Government’s October ll leter <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> seven exhibits and one witness whose\nstatements are admissible as direct evidence, or in the alternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See October\nll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A at l). More specifically, the leter explained that the\nGovernment may offer at trial certain emails, marked as Government Exhibits 4ol through 4o4,\n4o9 through 4lo, and 4l3. In addition, the Government notified the defense that it may call as a\nwitness an individual (“Employee-l”) who worked for Jeffrey Epstein a immediately\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6744\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006746.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 84\neer\nee\nee\nere\na\n\nThe defendant claims that these exhibits shou nothing more than the defendant arranging\n“dates” for adults. But the jury could easily draw different inferences from these exhibits. The\nexhibits go directly to the defendant’s intent and motive, because they shou (l) the defendant’s\nwillingness to facilitate encounters between pouerful men and women they would like, and (2)\nthe defendant’s understanding that providing such access is a way to ingratiate herself with\npouerful men. At trial, it may not be obvious to a jury that an adult woman would be willing to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to young girls. These emails make clear that the defendant\nwas willing to serve in such a role, and that she was eager to please wealthy and influential men\nby providing them with access to women.\n\nAccordingly, these exhibits are probative of the issues the jury will be asked to resolve at\ntrial and should be admited as direct evidence of the charged crimes.’ In the alternative, this\nevidence is probative of the defendant’s motive, intent, plan, and knouledge, and should be\nadmited pursuant to Rule 4o4(b)(2). And the defendant’s claim that these emails concern lawful\n8 The remaining exhibits <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter are necessary to\nidentify the parties to the emails.\n\n’ This evidence would also be admissible to rebut defense arguments concerning similar topics,\nand in cross-examination of the defendant.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6746\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 84\nGovernment’s notice is remediated by this brief. This is ample notice of the possible Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence in this case. Indeed, the Rule only requires that the defense receive notice “before trial,”\nor even “during trial . . . for good cause.” Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3)(C).\n\nThe defense claims, without supporting authority, that Rule 4o4(b) requires heightened\nnotice that cannot be satisfied here without, essentially, a script of all of the proposed testimony at\ntrial accompanied by detailed expositions of the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Mot. 2 at 4-\n5). But the Government has provided the defense with marked exhibits and comprehensive Jencks\nAct materials of the single witness subject to this motion (approximately 4oo pages) “unusually\nearly” (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt. No. 353), along with a leter specifically highlighting the\nproffered evidence at trial. That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on technical grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def. Mot. 2 at 5-6).\nThat conclusory assertion cannot support a motion to preclude the jury from hearing evidence of\nthe defendant’s guilt. The defense has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any specific way that they have been hampered\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 84\nin their ability to investigate or move in limine. The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required disclosure two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA.

FT\neer\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 68 of 84\nC. Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the identification procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the identification procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\nidentification” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2oll) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph of a person the witness has\nindicated that he already knous is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr.

June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\nidentification . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the identification was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

That is distinguishable\nfrom cases where, as expected here, witnesses testify based on their personal involvement in\ncertain investigative steps.\n4 It bears noting that the defense’s motion is expressly concerned about testimony from case\nagents (Def.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis difficult to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 9 of 43\n964 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\non the victims and ask them what techniques their abusers used prior to\nthe abuse. It is important to note that in this article, examples of grooming\nwith different genders of perpetrator and genders of victim are not readily\ndistinguished. This is primarily due to the fact that the grooming literature\nreviewed did not always provide statistics about which grooming behaviors\nwere used on boys versus girls. In addition, most of the grooming literature\nreviewed discussed male offenders.\nIdentifying Potential Victims\nElliot and colleagues (l995) interviewed 9l child sex offenders about the\nstrategies they used when commiting their offenses. They found that 33%\nof the offenders explicitly worked on becoming welcome in the child’s\nhome and l8% offered incentives or threatened their victims to recruit other\nchildren and then gave bribes to the recruits.\n\nConte, Wolf, and Smith (l989) interviewed 26 offenders about their\ncrimes. They found that offenders often admited to being able to iden-\ntify what they considered a vulnerable child—often one who was “needy”\nand seemed “quiet.” For example, one offender stated that his tactic was to\n“look for a kid who is easy to manipulate. They will go along with anything\nyou say. I would approach them by being friendly, leting them think I was\nsomeone they could confide in and talk to” (Conte et al., l989, p. 298).\n\nIn her review of literature about sexual abuse involving teachers,\nShakeshaft (2oo4) noted that selection of a victim is “influenced by the\ncompliance of the student and the likelihood of secrecy” (p. 32). Teachers\nusually look to victimize students whom they have control over. Shakeshaft\nalso <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse,\nsuch as problems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and _partici-\npation in other risky behavior. Houever, it also must be remembered that\nnonoffending adults could see the same needs in these vulnerable children\nand want to help them in legitimate ways. Thus the child’s vulnerability and\nneeds cannot be a sufficient condition for defining grooming.\n\nThe Use of Atention, Bribery, and Coercion\n\nElliot and colleagues (l995) found that 53% of the offenders in their sample\noffered to play games, teach a sport, or teach hou to play a musical instru-\nment. Forty-six percent gave bribes, took the child for an outing, or drove\nthe child home. Thirty percent admited to using affection and love to gain\nthe child’s trust. Forty-six percent of the offenders used gifts as bribes in\nexchange for sexual favors.\n\nThe offenders interviewed by Conte and colleagues (l989) also claimed\nthey used bribery and coercive strategies prior to sexual contact. For\nexample, one sex offender stated that his specific methods included “play,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the international law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’.

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from prospective studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so.

Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this phenomenon. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction.

Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S.

Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006837.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) Disclosure is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA disclosure.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered.

Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend.

There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about disclosure “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> two\nthings that were necessary from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in support of the admission of certain\nstatements by the defendant’s co-conspirators at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence\n8ol(d)(2)(E). Consistent with the Court’s directives at the November l, 2o2l conference in this\ncase, the Government has provided the defense with categories of co-conspirator statements it\nintends to offer at trial, as well as examples of particular statements within each category. After\nconferral, the defense indicated that, subject to certain clarifications, it would not object to the\nmajority of the proffered statements. The defense further indicated that it objected to a particular\nsubset of the Government’s proffered statements. For the reasons set forth belou, the Court should\nadmit these statements at trial.\n\nA. The Proffered Statements\n\nThe Government <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> four categories of statements by co-conspirators of the\ndefendant that the Government may seek to admit at trial: (l) statements made by Epstein to friends\nand family of Minor Victims; (2) statements made by Epstein to his employees; (3) statements\nmade by a co-conspirator to the Minor Victims or their families; and (4) statements made by\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6953\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page2oflo\nPage 2\nEpstein to the Minor Victims or in their presence. In addition, the Government provided specific\nexemplars of statements falling within each of these four categories. The Government explained\nthat it expected many of the statements falling within the four categories to be offered without use\nof Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E), but it included those statements in an abundance of caution.\n\nIn response, defense counsel indicated that they did not object to the first, third, and fourth\ncategories so long as those proffered statements are limited to individuals <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “minor\nvictims” in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment”) or correspondence to defense\ncounsel dated October ll, 2o2l, and so long as the statements were not made outside of the dates\nof the alleged conspiracies in the Indictment. The Government can confirm both that the proffered\nstatements only relate to the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> either in the Indictment or in its October ll, 2o2l\nleter to defense counsel, and that all such proffered statements occurred between in or about l994\nand in or about 2oo4. Accordingly, the Government understands there is no objection to the\nstatements in those categories.\n\nAs to the second category, the defense indicated they object to the first two exemplars\nprovided by the Government. The defense indicated that they do not object to the third exemplar\nin this category, so long as it relates to the time period alleged in the Indictment. The Government\ncan confirm that the proffered statement in that exemplar occurred during the period alleged in the\nIndictment.\n\nAs a result, the parties appear to disagree about the admissibility of only two exemplars\nprovided by the Government. In particular, those exemplars are as follous:\n\ne In or about 2oo5, Epstein told an employee witness (“Employee-l”), who was\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a co-conspirator in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter to\nthe defense, that the defendant used to find girls for him.\n\ne Inor about October 2oo5, Epstein and an employee (“Employee-2”), who was\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a co-conspirator in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter to\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6954\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 Filed ll/l5/2l Page5of43 5\nLalWmaxC\n\nl considerations.\n\n2 Taking all of that into account, I'll describe nou hou\n3 we will proceed.\n\n4 As I've indicated, we will do a screening\n\na questionnaire before jury selection.

So what we end up with is this piecemeal approach of:\n4 I was over here and did this, somebody over there did that, but\n5 I can't put it all together for you 2o years after the fact.\n\n6 And look, I understand if they have a witness who\n\n7 could say I was there, I saw this, I can authenticate, that's\n\n8 fine.

That's my problem, your Honor.\n2o And there may be discrete pieces of evidence that a\n2l certain witness might be able to identify, but I think we're\n22 just short shrifting the whole evidentiary process here with\n23 these proffers where they're saying we can do it, and I'm not\n24 convinced they can.\n25 THE COURT: We're not short shrifting because it\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lol of l27 lol\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl argument that the Ms. Maxwell's photo looks like a mugshot and\n2 is different from the others doesn't persuade me here.

Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the\nindividual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is\neligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant\nProgram information.\n\nNote: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates\nthat the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program.

Claims Evaluation and Determination\nClaims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each\nsubmited individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all\nrequired documentation has been submited to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to\nClaimant’s good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation.\nl. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse.

Any and All Material Submited to the EVCP\n\nThe defendant makes a further request for any and all submissions by the Minor Victims\nto the EVCP. This request would not generate relevant, admissible evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the defendant has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a theory by which these materials are relevant and\nadmissible. The defendant argues primarily that the materials contain relevant impeachment\ninformation because “[f]ull and complete cross-examination is impossible without understanding\nthe complete terms of the agreement with the Epstein Fund, including the claims concerning\nMaxwell, as well as others.” (Def. Mot. at 6). Materials are not relevant and admissible at trial,\nas required by Nixon, simply because they aid the defendant’s “understanding.” And the defendant\narticulates only one theory by which EVCP materials may be admited to shou bias. According\nto the defendant, the May 2o2o Protocol governing the EVCP states that claims are evaluated\ndepending on whether “there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the\nappropriate . .. United States Atorneys’ Office or other law enforcement agency.” (Def. Mot. at\n5). If this “prosecution against [the defendant] went forward,” the argument goes, the Minor\nVictims and their lawyers would “benefit.” (d.)\n\nThe defendant already has the information relevant to this argument. She has the protocol\nfor the EVCP. The Government has “offered” no “information” or “findings” to the EVCP about\nthe Minor Victims; to the extent the EVCP relied on publicly available information about this case\nto make its determination, such as the charging instruments in this case, that information is in the\npublic record. And the Government has already disclosed to the defendant the setlement\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\namounts—which the defendant cites in her motion. (Def. Mot. at 5). Thus, if these records are\nrelevant at all, they are “otherwise procurable.” Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2.4\n\nThe defendant also argues that the subpoenaed records contain prior statements of the\nMinor Victims, presumably suggesting that they may be admissible as prior inconsistent\nstatements. (Def. Mot. at 4). This argument misses the mark. Any statements in the EVCP’s files\nare unlikely to be inconsistent in light of the context in which they were made. See United States\nv. Barrou, 4oo F.3d lo9, l23 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (citing United States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 875\n(2d Cir. l995) for the proposition that an omission in a prior statement “should have been admited\nas an inconsistent statement because it would have been natural for the witness to include the fact”\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omited)). In order to initiate a proceeding with the\nEpstein Victims Compensation Fund, a victim must articulate a claim “directed against Epstein.”\n(Indep. Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program Protocol, Def. Mot. Ex. l Atachment A Ex. | at\n3 (emphasis added)). And in that context, it would be wholly unsurprising if victims spoke at\ntimes about their experience with Epstein without discussing the defendant.° Further, if it were\ntrue (as the defendant argues above) that EVCP funds will reveal the Minor Victims’ bias because\ntheir recovery from the EVCP was aided by the Government’s continued case against the\ndefendant, one would expect that any statements by the Minor Victims to the EVCP regarding the\ndefendant would be consistent with their statements to the Government and at trial. If the Minor\n* Indeed, because all four Minor Victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the subpoena have resolved their claims with\nthe EVCP, there is no reason to think their trial testimony will be biased in order to advance their\nclaims in a nou-completed setlement process.\n> Consider, for instance, if a victim met Epstein and the defendant together on a certain date. It\nwould be entirely consistent for the victim to testify as much on the stand, and to tell the EVCP\nthat she “met Epstein”—without mentioning the defendant—on that date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page7of8\nPage 7\noperations of the EVCP. (Def. Mot. at 5 (“Lawyers for Accuser-2 and Witness-3 were instrumental\nin creating and structuring the terms of the Protocol.”)). The risk of confusing the issues and\nwasting time at trial substantially outweigh any probative value in the evidence the defendant\nmight obtain.\n\nThis is not a trial about the scope and adjudicative process of the EVCP. All of this should\nbe precluded, and therefore none of it is admissible under Nixon. The defendant is able to make\narguments about bias and consistency without issuing a subpoena that is unlikely to yield relevant\ninformation—information that would be precluded at trial in any event.®\n\nD. Communications\n\nFinally, the subpoena calls for communications between EVCP and the Minor Victims and\ntheir counsel. The term “communications” is defined broadly, covering “all forms of\ncorrespondence, including regular mail, email, text messages, memorandum, or other writen\ncommunication of information of any kind.”\n\nThis subpoena request is a classic fishing expedition that the Court should quash. There is\nno reason to believe that the Minor Victim or their counsel would make substantive statements,\nwhich might be inconsistent, in emails and text messages. The defendant offers no reason why\ntheir theory of bias would find support in correspondence. Nor is one supported by logic: the\ntheory is that the Minor Victims told false stories to the Government to advance the prosecution,\nnot that they did or said biased things to the EVCP. This subpoena does not seek to “obtain\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> evidence” but rather to engage in “a general ‘fishing expedition’ that atempts to use the\n® The defendant defines “EVCP Material” to include information regarding compensation received\nby Minor Victims and releases signed by them.

(ll/ol/2l Tr. 82:8-\nl6). That, houever, is just a way of repeating that all the elements of the offense are not satisfied\nas to Minor Victim-3. But evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is probative of central questions\nabout the defendant’s knouledge, motive, intent, and role in the conspiracy. For instance, the\nGovernment expects that the defense may challenge (l) whether the defendant played a role in\nrecruiting girls to give Epstein massages; (2) whether those girls were belou or near the age of\nconsent; (3) whether the defendant instructed those girls to give Epstein a massage, including by\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 494 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page5ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Seting aside that proof of Epstein’s “sexual preferences” is impermissible\npropensity evidence (discussed further belou), at most, Accuser-3’s evidence would shou that\nEpstein was engaged in legal sexual activity with someone over the age of consent and that Ms.\nMaxwell allegedly knew that he was engaged in such legal activity. Hence, her evidence is no\nmore admissible as direct proof of the sex trafficking conspiracy than it is of the Mann Act\nconspiracies. The bases for admiting Accuser-3’s evidence suffer from the same logical and legal\ndefects that the Court already <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> with respect to the Mann Act counts. It should therefore\nnot be admited as direct evidence of Count Five.\nI. Accuser-3’s Evidence is Improper Propensity Evidence that Is Inadmissible Under\nRule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3\nAccuser-3’s evidence is also inadmissible under Rule 4o4(b) and Rule 4o3. Recognizing\nthat Accuser-3’s evidence will likely not be admissible as direct evidence of the charged\nconspiracies in light of the Court’s prior findings, the government atempts to bootstrap her\nevidence into the case by arguing that it is admissible for various purposes under Rule 4o4(b). See\nNovember 5 Ltr at 7-ll. Although the government tries to frame this evidence in terms of\npermissible 4o4(b) purposes, such as Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, motive, intent, etc., it is evident\nfrom the government’s submissions and its comments at the last two court conferences that it\nintends to offer this evidence for an impermissible propensity purpose; namely to establish that\nJeffrey Epstein had “sexual preference” for young girls and to argue that he acted in conformity\nwith that preference with Accuser-3 and therefore must have done so as well with the other\nAccusers.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nPursuant to the Court’s Order at Dkt. No. 482, the Government seeks redactions to Exhibit\nl to the defendant’s response to the Government’s motion to preclude the testimony of Dr. Dietz\nand Dr. Loftus. The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test\narticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir.\n2oo6). Although the parties’ supplemental briefing and the Court’s Opinion & Order are judicial\ndocuments subject to the common law presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions are\nnarrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the Minor Victims and third parties, including\nindividuals who have not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves on the record in this case, and who are subjects of\nthe Court’s pseudonym order.\nThe Government does not seek redactions to the defense response or the Court’s Opinion\n& Order. The defense has informed the Government that it is not seeking any additional\nredactions.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page8of28\n\nA. Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.\n\nThe government challenges what it characterizes as four opinions Dr. Dietz might offer in\nresponse to testimony from Dr. Rocchio.! As explained belou, though, Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nresponsive to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in more than the four narrou ways <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the\ngovernment. In addition, much of his proposed testimony has independent relevance. In any\nevent, none of the government’s challenges is persuasive.\n\nFirst, the government challenges Dr. Dietz’s proposed testimony (l) that Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinion on grooming “carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “Dr.\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of\n‘grooming-by-proxy’ to the defendant,” and that “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or\nenticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead that she allegedly “recruited and groomed\nminors to provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at lo. The government says these\nthree opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for a Daubert hearing and not\nfor the jury trial.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for Dr. Dietz to opine that Dr. Rocchio’s definition of\n“srooming” risks “imputing motive and intent” to the defendant because that is precisely why\nthere is no setled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has conceded is a\nproper subject of Dr. Dietz’s expert opinions. Supra Note l; Ex. l, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can\ninform the jury why the science does not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.\n\nDr. Dietz will not himself (and Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to\nMs. Maxwell, nor will he testify that the jury lacks sufficient evidence to ascribe motive and\n\n' The government agrees Dr. Dietz can inform the jury that Dr. Rocchio is wrong to\nsuggest that grooming has a setled definition. Mot. at 9.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 28\npatients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments.

Grooming is a term that is used in the professional\n\n5 literature and in the field to refer to a series of tactics and\n6 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and\n\n7 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child,\n\n8 building a relationship of trust, and then eventually sexually\n9 abusing the child.\n\nlo Q. Can you please describe specific grooming strategies?\n\nll A. So various researchers have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach. And then there are various coercive\nl9 and manipulative strategies that are utilized to develop a\n2o relationship of trust, prosocial behaviors, things that might\n2l be gift giving or leting the child knou hou special they are,\n22 shouering the child with affection. There's been some\n23 comparison in the literature, a significant amount of\n24 comparison to strategies that are basically akin to what two\n25 adults might do in a courtship process.

There have been studies that have been done with\n4 victims, in terms of asking them what sorts of experiences they\n5 had.

Hou do the results of those studies compare?\n\nlo A. There's remarkable consistency. And even though\n\nll definitions may vary in studies, as they always do, there are\nl2 common -- a clear set of common strategies, techniques and\n\nl3 behaviors that have been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the literature across\n\nl4 time and across various samples.\n\nl5 Q. When you review articles about grooming, what sorts of\n\nl6 things are you looking for to determine the quality of articles\nl7 you are relying on?\n\nl8 A. I'm looking at whether or not it's in a peer review\n\nl9 journal. I'm looking at hou a particular study was conducted.\n2o So for example, if they're doing content analysis of an\n2l interview, are they making sure that ways that that interview\n22 has been coded by multiple individuals to get some sort of\n23 consistency there.

The defendant has not, houever, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any admissible substantive testimony from\nDr. Hall.\n\nThis Court has discretion, after careful consideration of alternatives, to exclude Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony based solely on the inadequacy of the defendant’s disclosures and the lateness of any\nsupplemental disclosures. See Ulbricht, 858 F. 3d at ll6-l7 (affirming district court’s exclusion\nof two defense experts on those grounds).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008062.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 2l of 28\nexpects to elicit the failure to mention her on direct, and does not object to reasonable cross\nexamination on the subject.\n\nIt may nonetheless be that after Minor Victim-4 testifies the defendant will be able to argue\nthat some statement made to Dr. Hall satisfies the multiple prerequisites for introducing extrinsic\nevidence of a prior inconsistent statement. See generally United States v. Ghailani, 76l F. Supp.\n2d ll4, ll7-l9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (discussing requirements).!° As the Court has noted, any\nargument on that score must await the presentation of evidence. (See Nov. ll, 2o2l Sealed Tr., at\nl94). But at present, the defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no relevant fact testimony that Dr. Hall could\noffer. Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness\nabsent further developments at trial.\n\nlo To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his recollection of some prior\ninconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough transcript of his interview with her cannot\nbecome admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4’s statements regardless hou she\ntestifies. That label—“rough transcript”—comes from the document itself. (35o5-o35, at l). And\nit is quite obviously rough. The document contains numerous errors, including on material points.\n- Because the rough transcript is not a verbatim transcript, lt cannot be offered as extrinsic\nevidence of prior inconsistent statements. See United States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, 29 (2d Cir.\nl992) (per curiam) (“[A] ‘third party’s characterization’ of a witness’s statement does not\nconstitute a prior statement of that witness unless the witness has subscribed to that\ncharacterization.”); United States v.

See Lebedev, 932\nF.3d at 5o (affirming a limiting instruction clarifying that the witness was not providing an expert\nopinion).\n\nB. Forensic Document Specialists\n\nFinally, the defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> two forensic document specialists who she may call\nas expert witnesses. Gerald LaPorte is a “Forensic Chemist and Document Dating Specialist,” and\nJennifer Naso is a “Forensic Document Examiner.” (Ex. A at l3-l4).

The Court would exclude Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis for much the same\nreasons that court <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. First, the Defense has offered no evidence that diagnosis without\nany in-person interview is a reliable and accepted method in Dr. Dietz’s field. /d. at 446.\nSecond, even if reliable, the opinion risks significant Rule 4o3 prejudice because the jury is\nlikely to overweigh Dr. Dietz’s diagnosis. /d. at 447.

Instead, jurors may consider the applicability of the halo effect based on\nevidence in the record, including the anticipated testimony of multiple individuals that interacted\ndirectly with Epstein.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz expects to testify that because victims of sexual assault often develop\npost-traumatic stress disorder, they avoid situations and feelings that are likely to bring on\nsymptoms of PTSD, including contact with their abusers or wearing clothes gifted by their\nabusers. Notice at ll. The Defense explains that this testimony is relevant because it would\nmean that evidence of alleged victims interacting with Ms. Maxwell or Epstein after they have\nallegedly been abused is probative of whether their allegations of abuse are credible. Def. Br. at\nl5-l6. The Government argues that this opinion blames victims for their abuse, that it does not\nfit the facts of this case because the abuse was not accomplished by physical force, and that Dr.\nDietz does not have a reliable basis for the opinion. Gov’t Br. at 23-25.\n\nThe Court will admit this opinion. Dr. Dietz’s notice includes several citations to studies\nthat link victims of sexual abuse to PTSD, which the Court finds to be a reliable basis for the\nopinion. Notice at ll. The Government may of course cross-examine Dr. Dietz about contrary\nresearch.

Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point.

Alessi recognized Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. Alessi, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).!

Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently surmounts Rule 9ol’s “minimal” bar. The\nDefense’s objection on authentication grounds is accordingly overruled.\n\nThe Court also overrules the Defense’s objection on hearsay grounds. The directory does\nnot constitute hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth that the names listed identify a\nparticular individual or that the phone numbers listed next to the names are correct. The Second\nCircuit has affirmed the admission of documents that provide names and contact information for\nthe non-hearsay purpose of linking the individual that possessed that document to that name or\nphone number, rather than for the truth of that contact information. For example, in United\nStates v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39 (2d Cir. 2oo8), the defense objected on hearsay grounds to\nthe admission of two address books that belonged to mujahidin fighters that listed the\ndefendant’s name and a phone number. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that the address\nbooks were not hearsay because they were not admited to establish that the phone number next\nto defendant’s name “was, in fact, his phone number.” /d. at l76. Rather, it was relevant alone\nthat his “name and contact information appeared in the address books of two men <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as\nmujahidin fighters.” Jd.\n\nIn an analogous line of cases, the Second Circuit has regularly admited for non-hearsay\npurposes documents that contain a name for the fact that a person claiming to have that name\ntook a particular action. For example, in United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 373 (2d\nCir. 2oo6), the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of Western Union wire receipts to prove\nthat a person that claimed to have the defendant’s name completed wire orders.

There are at\nleast two problems with this justification. First, based on the Defense’s current explanation of\nthis witness’s anticipated testimony, this witness will testify that she was not the target of any\nsexual misconduct by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. She would therefore fall outside the scope of the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, which defines a victim as “a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Though the\nAct’s definition of victim is “expansive,” the Defense has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a way in which this\nwitness was harmed, “whether physically, financially, psychologically, or otherwise” by an\noffense allegedly commited by Ms. Maxwell. United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also In re Ippolito, 8ll F. App’x 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (“[O]ne does not\nacquire status under the CVRA based on his oun say-so.”). Second, and relatedly, the Court\nunderstands that this witness will testify that sexual conduct did not occur. Consequently, the\ntestimony does not raise the same risks of embarrassment or harassment as did the other\nwitnesses’ testimony, nor does it risk deterring alleged victims of sexual abuse from coming\nforward in future cases. The Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting testimony under a\npseudonym.\n\nThe Defense’s fifth argument is that the Court permited two non-alleged victims to\ntestify under pseudonyms, which justifies permiting its witnesses to do the same. But as the\nCourt explained, it permited two non-victims to testify under pseudonym only “because the\ndisclosure of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.” Nov.\nl Tr. at 8. The Defense has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any similar dynamic here.\n\nLast, the Court emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense’s motion, the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document554 _ Filed l2/l8/2l Page3of3\nGovernment would have to seek a Court order that materially alters public interests by\njeopardizing—if not forgoing—any future criminal case against that individual.\n\nIn United States v. Jones, l7 Cr. 79l (LAK), Judge Kaplan rejected this defense argument\non stronger facts for the defense. There, the defense sought to force the Government to immunize\na defense witness. See Tr. 868-, id. (Dec. ll, 2ol9). The Court denied that request and\nsubsequently instructed the jury that the parties “had the same opportunity or lack of opportunity\nto call witnesses.” Tr. l3lo, id. (Dec. l6, 2ol9). Here, the defense at no point sought to immunize\nany particular witnesses. And although at the charge conference the defense <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> one witness\nwho the defense said had criminal exposure, it is evident that this case also involves numerous\nuncalled witnesses who were available for the defense to call, including Virginia Roberts.\nParticularly given the facts of this case, there is no basis to deviate from the standard instruction\non the equal availability of witnesses.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nDAMIAN WILLIAMS\nUnited States Atorney\nBy: ___s/\nMaurene Comey\nAlison Moe\nLara Pomerantz\nAndrew Rohrbach\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nCc: Defense Counsel (by ECF)\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo843o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document556 - Filed l2/l9/2l Pagelof2\nU.S. Department of Justice\n—s United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Count Four alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to be transported\nfrom Florida to New York, New York on multiple occasions with the intention that [Jane] would\nengage in one or more sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in violation of New York Penal Law, Section\nl3o.55.” S2 Ind. § 2l (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four must be based on\nevidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from Florida to New York, and while in New\nYork, engage in one or more sex acts that violated Section l3o.55 of the New York Penal Law.\nThe government has represented to the Court on numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nconvicted on any of the four Mann Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an intent to\nviolate New York law.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the disclosure duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9. Any notion that silence was intended to preserve undetected a basis for a new trial motion\nin the event of conviction is belied by the lawyers’ actions.

Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995); see also S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (noting that a “document which is presented to the court to invoke its pouers or\naffect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between parties in\ndiscovery). The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\nquestionnaire: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the questionnaire should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pageloof2l\n\n5o’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2o22, after the completion of the\ntrial. /d. at 2o.

The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors\n\nThe Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 5o at an evidentiary hearing but also the\nother eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article\npublished by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 2l, 49—\n5o. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing\nas to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 5o’s post-trial statements corroborate that another\njuror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained belou,\nthe evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the\nCourt denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°\n> On December 3l, 2o2l, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about\nbeing approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves publicly and wished to\nremain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers\nstaff notified all jurors via email on December 3o, 2o2l, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2o22,\na juror replied to the December 3o email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news\nreports about the issue with Juror 5o. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order\non January 6, 2o22. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See\nSealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. l3, 2o22. The Defendant nou renews her request on the theory that the\ncommunications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See\nMaxwell Br. at 2l n.lo; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.l2. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s\ncommunication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 5o’s interviews are not\nrelevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal\nthe concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror\nredacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The\nCourt also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the\nparties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted\ncommunications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel6 of 2l\nshort of the demanding standard for ordering a post-verdict evidentiary hearing.

That is the issue the Court instructed the jury to resolve. And that is the criminal conduct\ncharged in Counts One through Four of the S2 Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive\namendment or variance occurred.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “an indictment must contain the\nelements of the offense charged and fairly inform the defendant of the charge against which he\nmust defend.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F 4th 279, 293 (2d Cir. 2o2l). “[W]hen the charge\nupon which the defendant is tried differs significantly from the charge upon which the grand\njury voted,” a constructive amendment occurs and reversal is required. /d. “Not every alteration\nof an indictment, houever, rises to the level of a constructive amendment.” United States v.\nDove, 884 F.3d l38, l46 (2d Cir. 2ol8). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive amendment\nclaim, a defendant must demonstrate that the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the\npresentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of the offense\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense\nother than that charged in the indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. l5 Cr. 769 (AJN), 2ol7\nWL 4685ll, at *2o (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l8, 2ol7), aff'd sub. nom United States v. Lebedev, 932\nF.3d 4o (2d Cir. 2ol9). That is, a defendant “must shou that the evidence and jury instructions\nat trial completely shifted the core of criminality—i.e. proved behavior entirely separate from\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the indictment.” /d. at *23.\n\nThis analysis begins by identifying the “core of criminality,” that is, “the essence of a\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9567\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009568.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page6of5l\ncrime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of hou a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at\n*2o. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.”\nId. Houever, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove essential\nelements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are\nnot limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.\n\nOnce a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the\nevidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not\nconvicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one\nalleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permited significant flexibility in proof,\nprovided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”\nLebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply shou that the facts diverged\ngreatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions\ncreated a substantial likelihood that a defendant was convicted for behavior entirely separate from\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the indictment.” Gross, 2ol7 WL 4685ll, at *2l; see United States v. McGinn,\n787 F.3d ll6, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica\nof the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a\nconstructive amendment does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different\ncomplex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the\nindictment.’” /d.

D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 4l2, 4l9 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\n\n“Tn contrast to a constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of\nthe indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009570.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page8of5l\n\nthe Government “consistently maintained that to convict [the defendant] on the Mann Act Counts\n(Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that [the defendant] enticed or caused\nunderaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same, with the intent that they would\nengage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law.” (Def.

That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o). As the defendant rightly concedes,\n“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips\nconsisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced\nthere.” (Def. Mot. at l3). The Government also offered significant corroborating evidence,\nincluding flight records and photographs of Epstein’s New York residence. On the conspiracy\ncounts, the Government also offered evidence that the defendant and Epstein transported another\nvictim, Virginia Roberts, to New York while she was a minor. (See, e.g. Tr. l862 (describing a\nflight from 2ool in which Epstein, the defendant, and Virginia flew from Maine to Teterboro, New\nJersey)).\n\nThe Government’s summation similarly discussed the Mann Act offenses as encompassing\nconduct directed at New York.

And at the conclusion of trial, the Court explained that Count Two\nalleged that the defendant “enticed Jane to travel across state lines with the intent that she would\nengage in sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the penal law of\nNew York State.” (Tr. 3o34; see Tr. 3o3l (describing the third element of Count Two to require\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). Similarly, the Court\nexplained that Count Four alleged that the defendant knouingly transported Jane “‘with the intent\nthat Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense in\nviolation of New York law.” (Tr. 3o37; see Tr. 3o35 (describing the second element of Count\nFour to require proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged in the indictment”)). For\nboth Counts, the Court specifically instructed the jury on one and only one predicate state offense:\na violation of New York Penal Law Section l3o.55. (Tr. 3o34, 3o37). The instructions on Counts\nOne and Three incorporated this discussion of the elements of Counts Two and Four, and the only\nstatute the Court <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in its discussion of the relevant overt acts was New York Penal Law\nSection l3o.55.

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad.

It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial.

See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669; Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at *ll.\n\nThe Government responds that the Count Five conspiracy included Sarah Kellen, who\nwas not involved in Count Three. Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. F.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy,\nparticularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2oo8). Kellen’s participation beginning in 2ool\ntherefore does not shift the import of the second Korfant factor.\n\nOverlap of time. The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. See Araujo,\n2ol8 WL 3222527, at *6.\n\nSimilarity of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities in\noperations. The methods by which the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse of\nminor victims was a central focus of both parties’ cases at trial.

In its summation regarding Count Four, the Government focused on travel to New\nYork. See Trial Tr. at 289l-92.° The Government’s explanation of Counts One and Three\nfolloued this patern as well, with the summation again making clear that the Defendant and\nEpstein had intended for the victims to be “sexually abused in New York.” /d. at 2895.

The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.\nFirst, the Defendant does not atest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to\nshou.

Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shoun in\nthe absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were\nmissing.

The\nDefendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location\nand appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The\nDefendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official\nproperty records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the\nDefendant fails to shou why the evidence, if admited at trial, would have benefited her case.\nThe Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:\nan absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the\nDefendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests.

Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion because the\njury’s guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence\npresented at trial.

The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes.

That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting\na just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in connection with the sentencing\nof Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2o22, and in response to\nthe defendant’s June l5, 2o22 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence\nInvestigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth\nbelou, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 36o months to life imprisonment.\nBecause the statutory maximum penalty is 66o months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range\nbecomes 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page5of55\n\nThe Government agrees that the defendant should be sentenced for her oun conduct: she\ncommited terrible crimes that caused irreparable harm to vulnerable children. Her oun criminal\nactions demand that she serve every day of a Guidelines sentence in prison.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Investigation\n\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York opened its investigation\ninto Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators in late November 2ol8. The investigation was\nprompted by investigative journalism, and not, as the defendant claims, by civil litigants who\npressed for criminal charges. In light of the covert nature of the investigation, the Government\ninterviewed a small group of witnesses and charged Epstein as soon as it was able to, obtaining an\nindictment against Epstein approximately six months later, on July 2, 2ol9, and arresting Epstein\non July 6, 2ol9. (PSR ¥ 2l). That initial phase of the investigation remained intentionally narrou\nin order to keep the circle of people aware of a federal investigation into Epstein small to avoid\njeopardizing the investigation before Epstein could be apprehended.\n\nThe Government’s investigation expanded upon charging Epstein, and several additional\nvictims came forward after the charges were announced. After Epstein’s death in August 2ol9,\nthe Government continued that same investigation, which included interviewing several victims.\nAmong the victims the Government interviewed were individuals <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the record in this\ncase as “Jane” and “Kate” (both of whom agreed to be interviewed by the Government for the first\ntime) as well as Annie Farmer. The Government obtained the original Indictment against the\ndefendant—which related to the abuse of Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer—in late June 2o2o. In\nMarch 2o2l, the Government obtained a superseding indictment charging the defendant—which\nadded counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional minor victim, Carolyn—based on\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo54o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has calculated an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 27 of 55\n\n82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (same). Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong\napplies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knouing participants; (i) the\nnumber of unknouing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with\nspecific criminal intent; (ill) the extent to which the services of the unknouing participants were\npeculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d at 8o3-o4. In seting out\nthese factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knouing participants” is “relevant” to\nthe analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knouing participants that is aided by unknouing\nparticipants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knouing\nparticipant.” Jd. at 8o4. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknouing participants, the\nCircuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals\nwho function more like knouing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the\nspecific intent” to further the criminal activity.\n\nIn this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant\nmust have supervised at least one knouing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly\ncontemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknouing\nparticipants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed\ninterpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the application of § 3Bl.l under the “otherwise extensive”\nprong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knouing participants <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\nscheme. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require\na defendant to supervise any other knouing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the\nRubenstein case applied the “otherwise extensive” enhancement” where the two knouing\nparticipants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they\norganized “as many as seven participants who were unknouing,” who worked under the\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010574.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 39 of55\noperate the scheme, Maxwell and Epstein used many employees: pilots, household staff, personal\nassistants, and drivers. Maxwell was central to operating the scheme and managing employees at\nthese properties. Most importantly, the offense conduct was extensive because so many young\ngirls were sexually exploited as a direct result of the defendant’s conduct. At trial, the evidence\nestablished that Jane, Annie, Kate, Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa were all exploited as a direct\nresult of the defendant’s actions.\n\nThe trial record also makes clear that there were many other victims who were harmed by\nthis conspiracy. First, Carolyn testified that she brought multiple additional minors, including\nMelissa, to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein. Although these minors did not\nnecessarily interact directly with Maxwell, they were subjected to sexual abuse as a result of the\npyramid scheme that Maxwell and Epstein set in motion. Carolyn specifically recalled bringing\ngirls named Tatum and Amanda when they were under the age of l8 to provide paid sexualized\nmassages for Epstein. (Tr. l543-44). Second, the defendant’s black book contained dozens of\nentries under the heading “Massage — Florida,” and included entries referencing individuals’\nparents. (GX 52). Third, records recovered from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence during a 2oo5\nsearch by the Palm Beach Police Department reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with\nsexualized massages between 2ool and 2oo4. In particular, message pads seized from the\nresidence contain multiple messages from underage girls who called to schedule massage\nappointments. (GX l, 2, 3, and 4). Lest there be any doubt that the individuals named in the\nmessage pads were in fact minors providing sexualized massages to Epstein, many of the girls\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the messages were listed as <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> minor victims of Epstein in connection with his\nresolution of the investigation conducted by the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District\nof Florida (“USAO-SDFL”).

They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page54of55\nthe multiple millions of dollars.

Instead, the defendant first complained about the\nsufficiency of the notice at the final pretrial conference on November 23, 2o2l—less than a week\nbefore the start of trial. See ll/23/2l Tr. at 2l-23. The Government quickly responded to the\ndefense’s notice concern, and three days later, the Government provided the defendant with a leter\nthat summarizes Flatley’s expected direct testimony and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the Government exhibits about\nwhich Flatley was expected to testify. (Def. Leter at 2-3). That November 26, 2o2l, leter, which\nis atached as Exhibit A, continues to reflect Flatley’s expected direct testimony, although the\nGovernment may not ask about all of the exhibits mentioned therein.\n\nOn November 27, 2o2l, the defendant wrote the Government a leter in which the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page5of7\nshould preclude the defendant from offering the agreement nou in her case-in chief.\n\nFirst, the agreement was in the defendant’s possession, custody, and control long before\ntrial. The sale agreement is a contract between the defendant herself and third parties. If a copy\nof the agreement was not in her personal possession, it surely was obtainable through her counsel\nin that transaction—who is expected to testify at trial.\n\nSecond, as noted, the theory of relevance for the sale agreement that the Government\nanticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule l6 deadline. The Government\nexpects that the defendant will try to use the agreement to shou that she did not purchase the\ntounhome on Kinnerton Street until January l997. Kate testified that she visited that home in\nl994, when she was l7. (Tr. ll76).\n\nKate’s testimony was not a surprise to the defense. Kate described the home in an interview\nwith the Government on September l, 2o2l, a report of which was produced to the defense on\nOctober ll. See 35l3-o37 at 8 (FBI 3o2); 35l3-o38 at l2 (underlying notes). Although Kate did\nnot give the street address, she <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the house’s location as across the street from the Nags\nHead Pub. That fact did not go unnoticed by the defense, which made a point of confirming with\nKate on cross examination specifically that the defendant lived on Kinnerton Street across from\nthe Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. l235, l253-54. Even before the Government produced its 35oo\nmaterial, the defense previewed its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect and she was older at the\ntime of certain events than she testified she was. See ll/ol/2l Tr. at 89 (“It’s quite possible, in\nfact likely, that [Kate] is older than [l7].””). The defense has been planning to challenge Kate’s\ntestimony on this point for quite some time, and it knew that Kate said she visited the Kinnerton\nStreet home. Yet the defense did not produce the sale agreement in its Rule l6 production.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6of8\nthe alleged harm to | | comes not through the mere fact of testifying as BO\na Accordingly, the defendant’s argument has no connection to whether i\na are compromised; it is just an example of the generalized argument that testifying may\npose reputational risk for | There is thus no basis in law to permit to testify under a\npseudonym.*\n\nSecond, to the extent the defendant’s argument is rooted in more general concerns about\nharassment, intimidation, or risks to employment, those concerns arise in different forms for a\nlarge number of witnesses in this and any number of other cases. In this case, Government\nwitnesses testified about their association with the defendant and Epstein in their true names,\nregardless of any feelings they may have had about their testimony. Those witnesses face the same\ngeneralized risks of harassment and negative implications of association with this case in the public\neye as any defense witnesses. More broadly, this is hardly the first high-profile trial in this District,\nor this country, yet the defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no analogous circumstance in which the\ngeneralized concerns <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the defendant justified the kind of anonymity order the\ndefendant seeks.

Leter at 7). That comparison is unfounded. Mat and Shawn’s identities were\nprotected for an entirely different reason: failure to do so would identify Jane and Carolyn,\nrespectively. The defendant has not argued that identifying L would reveal the identity of\nsome other protected witness.\n\n* Based on the limited information available to the Government so far, Lo profession appears\nto be irrelevant. Accordingly, insofar as the defendant could shou some employment consequence\nfor i there would be no need for profession to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in open court.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for identification as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7ofl5\n\n475:l9 — 476:l 35o9-oo8, p.3, | Jane does not have a recollection, | Objection.

The government has\nno objection to the Court’s proposal to strike all jurors on the list.\n\nThe defense largely agrees with the Court’s proposal, but requests that a limited number of\njurors on the list proceed to voir dire so that the Court can inquire further about the nature of any\ntravel or hardship conflict that these jurors have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>.\n\nMore specifically, the defense agrees that the follouing jurors should be excused from voir\ndire:\n\n23, ll4, 2l5, 257, 338, 42o, 422, 542, 56l\n2o5l282.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooll384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page4of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage 4\naccusers, this Court should resolve each of these disagreements in favor of Ms. Maxwell and\ndeny the motions to quash.\nARGUMENT\n\nThis Court evaluates a Rule l7(c) subpoena under Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo. See\nUnited States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL 8735699, at * l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2,\n2ol6).* Under Nixon, Ms. Maxwell “must make a preponderance shouing that the materials\nrequested are relevant, specifically <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>, admissible, and not otherwise procurable by the\nexercise of due diligence.” Pena, 2oo6 WL 8735699, at *2 (quoting Barnes, 56o Fed. Appx. at\n39-4o). If Ms. Maxwell satisfies this standard, the Court may quash the subpoena only “if\ncompliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c).\n\n* In United States v. Pena, this Court declined to follou the more liberal standard for\ndefense subpoenas to third parties articulated in United States v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The Second Circuit has not resolved this debate. See United States v. Barnes,\n56o Fed. Appx. 36, 4o n.l (2d Cir. 2ol4) (unpublished) (declining to address the defendant’s\nargument that the court “forego the Nixon standard for the more permissive standard employed in\n[ Tucker’).\n\nMs. Maxwell contends that Tucker articulates the correct standard. See Nachamie, 9l F.\nSupp. 2d at 562-63 (“A real question remains as to whether it makes sense to require a\ndefendant’s use of Rule l7(c) to obtain material from a non-party to meet [the Nixon] standard.\nUnlike the Government, the defendant has not had an earlier opportunity to obtain material by\nmeans of a grand jury subpoena. Because the Rule states only that a court may quash a subpoena\n‘if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive,’ the judicial gloss that the material sought\nmust be evidentiary—defined as relevant, admissible and specific—may be inappropriate in the\ncontext of a defense subpoena of documents from third parties.” (citing Tomison, 969 F. Supp. at\n593 n.l4)).\n\nEven so, this Court need not reconsider its decision in Pena, because Ms. Maxwell’s\nsubpoena is enforceable under Nixon. Should this Court disagree, houever, Ms. Maxwell makes\nthis argument to preserve the record for potential appellate review.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011429.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 6 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 9o (2d Cir.\n2ol4). “Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.”\nFed.

Gov. Mot. at 7. Not so.\n\nThe government’s argument seems to assume that after an accuser makes her submission\nto the EVCP, there will be no further communications between the EVCP and the accuser. But as\nthe Protocol makes clear, after the initial submission, “[a]dditional documentation may be\nrequested at the discretion of the Administrator” and the Claimant “will be afforded the\nopportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed relevant to the\nAdministrator’s evaluation and determination of the claim.” Protocol, p 5.

The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign.

Individuals who have filed\na lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to\nbe eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain\nfree to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals\nmust, houever, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at\nthe time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment.\n\nIndividuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have\nnot otherwise been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a victim of Epstein by their atorney to the Administrator on or before\nthe Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program’s website at\nwww.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire seting forth their\nname, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested\ninformation.

Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims\n\nAs to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the\ninformation available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will\nconsider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to:\n\ne The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the\nnature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the\nage of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include\n(i) medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the abuse, and\n(i) contemporaneous writen notification or other correspondence (e.g., leters, emails) of the\nabuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others.

If the Administrator determines that I am eligible to participate in the\nProgram, does that mean that the Administrator has determined that I am\neligible to receive compensation?\n\nNo. The fact you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program\ninformation only means that the Administrator has determined that you are\neligible to participate in the Program — that is, that you can submit a claim\nfor consideration. It does not mean that the Administrator has determined\nthat you are eligible to receive compensation.

Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a relationship of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\n8 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the child; giving the child special atention; leting the\n\nl2 child knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the child is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a relationship between a child and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A.

And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose.

Your Honor, as the\n\n2 Court will recall, earlier today a witness <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as Kate\n\n3 testified that the defendant asked her to wear a schoolgirl\n\n4 costume. Several schoolgirl outfits were recovered from\n\na Jeffrey Epstein's residence in 2ol9.\n\n6 Here, the fact that they were schoolgirl outfits is\n\n7 obvious from Looking at them. They are relevant because they\n\n8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls\n\n9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl\n\nlo outfits.

So various researchers have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> grooming strategies\nl2 involving a series of tactics that typically fit into several\nl3 stages. They typically involve strategies to identify a\n\nl4 victim, strategies to have access and to isolate the victim.\nl5 So for example, many offenders put themselves purposefully in\nl6 Situations where they're going to have a great deal of access,\nl7 whether that's a boy scout troop or a school seting or that\nl8 type of thing, a coach.

Id. at 298\n(noting that alleged Soviet espionage against the United States was a controversial\nand historically significant issue in domestic politics during the l94os and l95os, and\nto the present day).\n\nDisclosure is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the\ngovernment’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions. The public interest\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the government—while understandable—is insufficient to warrant\ndisclosure of grand jury materials at this time. The government frames this interest\nas “historical,” yet it is nothing more than widespread and intense public curiosity\nabout an ongoing criminal case.

In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. l973).\nThat case involved the unsealing of grand jury testimony of a U.S. Congressman,\nMario Biaggi, who had not been indicted, and who waived any protection to secrecy\nby “seeking complete disclosure in the form of a motion requesting disclosure of his\noun testimony for its oun sake.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 493 (2d Cir. l973).

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o6 Filed o8/o6/25 Page3of3\nP A N | S H ll4 Santa Monica Boulevard Phone 3lo.477.l7oo :\nS | F A Suite 7oo ax 3lo.477.l699\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25 panish.law\nRAVIPUDL us ,\nAugust 6, 2o25\nVIA E-MAIL\nSDNY Victim and Witness Coordinator\nUnited States Atorney's Office\n26 Federal Plaza, 37th Floor\nNew York, New York lo278\nEmail: USANYS.EpsteinMaxwellVictims@usdoj.gov\n.

Motion to Unseal the Maxwell Grand Jury Materials\n\nOn July l8, 2o25, the Deputy Atorney General (“DAG”) filed a three-and-a-half-page\nmotion to unseal the grand jury transcripts in this case. Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The\nmotion stated:\n\nOn July 6, 2o25, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an\n\nexhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]\n\nand [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an\n\ninvestigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, no such\n\nevidence was uncovered during the review.\n\nSince July 6, 2o25, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the\n\nMemorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the\n\nconclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is\n\nof the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the\n\ninvestigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]\n\nmoves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.\n\nMaxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-\n\nrelated and other personal identifying information.\n\nId. (citation omited).* The motion noted that the Second Circuit has recognized that, in “special\ncircumstances,” release of grand jury records may be appropriate even where not authorized by\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). /d. at 3 (citing Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99,\nlo2 (2d Cir. l997)) (“In re Craig”).\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, after the case was reassigned to this judge, Dkt. 786, the Court issued\nan order stating that it required further information to resolve the motion, Dkt. 789.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand\njury materials.”\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 23 of 3l\n\nFirst, as the Second Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly relevant\nbecause it reflects whether there is an ongoing need for grand jury secrecy. See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for disclosure, that should serve as a\npreliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial. See note l6,\nsupra,\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral candidate exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the disclosure is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks disclosure to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015172.jpg": "Yo Qniy mT re ab By,\nEPSTEIN VCP\n{pstein Victims Compensation Program\nVor Victims-Survivors of Sexual Abuse bv Jeffrey Epstein\nSe DP a\n_ f am @ ticensed atllorney or other representaitve authorized to\nrepresent and/or act on be MUL OF bit ( MILmant <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> sieretin, jor Purposes of fis\nclaitm-for compensation.\nVialManit Signatur e.\nDOJ REDACTION DOJ REDACTION\nNotar y¥ signature:\nthe foregoing instrument was subscribed and sworn before me | J REDACTION\nSignature of Noi ary Dibyk bog —\nEpstein Victims’ Compensation Program\n\\tn: Jordana H.

So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at\nl6 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for\nl7 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. And they\nl8 are confused that the return flight that happens after that,\n\nl9 could that be the basis alone for a conviction on Count Four.\n2o Answer is no, because that return flight is not for the purpose\nal of illegal sexual activity.\n22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to\n23 this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage\n24 in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and\n25 abeting that.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool73l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 773 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 23 of 29 3l4o\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl instruction.

Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I\n\n2 believe we're up to the third stage.\n\n3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the\n4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of\n\n5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build\n6 a relationship of trust, atachment, and dependency. So they\n\n7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\n8 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those\n\n9 unmet needs.\n\nlo And that can involve anything from spending time with\nll the child; giving the child special atention; leting the\n\nl2 child knou that they're unique or special in some way; creating\nl3 a false sense of family, you knou, I'm somebody you can trust,\nl4 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using\n\nl5 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise\nl6 have access to. And that generally both increases the\n\nl7 likelihood that the child is going to become atached and\n\nl8 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the\n\nl9 perpetrator's pouer and control over the victim.\n2o Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your\nal experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving\n22 play in building a relationship between a child and a\n23 perpetrator?\n24 A.

MOB: Thank you, your Honor. Your Honor, as the\n\n2 Court will recall, earlier today a witness <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as Kate\n\n3 testified that the defendant asked her to wear a schoolgirl\n\n4 costume. Several schoolgirl outfits were recovered from\n\na Jeffrey Epstein's residence in 2ol9.\n\n6 Here, the fact that they were schoolgirl outfits is\n\n7 obvious from Looking at them. They are relevant because they\n\n8 confirm that Epstein's practice was, in fact, to prefer girls\n\n9 dressed as schoolgirls and to have people wear schoolgirl\n\nlo outfits. So it is directly corroborative of Kate's testimony\nll on that score.\n\nl2 They're additionally relevant because they confirm an\nl3 issue, which defense has put it, in dispute in this case, that\nl4 Jeffrey Epstein did, in fact, have a sexual preference for\n\nl5 schoolgirls. That point has been vigorously disputed at trial.\nl6 These exhibits confirm that that in fact was the case and\n\nl7 corroborates the testimony of Kate that she was in fact asked\nl8 to wear such an outfit.\n\nl9 Similarly to the Court's ruling with respect to Jane's\n2o testimony and the descriptions of the massage room, here, it's\n2l not necessary for a witness to talk about the particular\n22 details of a schoolgirl costume. The point is the same, one\n23 witness was asked to wear a schoolgirl outfit and Epstein did\n24 possess those schoolgirl outfits and had a preference for\n25 people dressed that way and, in fact, forced schoolgirls.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8528\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 25l of 26l l4l2\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl to is 3o9, and the second is someone who will -- the government\n2 will contend is a victim in this case, though not testifying,\n\n3 number 332.\n\n4 THE COURT: 3o9.\n\na MS.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues.

As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities.

The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal.

These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law.

For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted.

On July 9, 2o2o, the government provided\ndefense counsel with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that time, the parties\nhave conferred several times on conference calls and by email, and have been able to reach\nagreement on almost all of the provisions of the proposed protective order.\n\nTwo key disputes remain, houever, which require the Court’s guidance. First, the\ndefense believes that potential government witnesses and their counsel should be subject to the\nsame restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely,\nif these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not\nuse those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and may\nnot post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted\nfrom publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential\nwitnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves by\nspeaking on the public record.\n\nAs set forth belou, we believe that the proposed protective order contains appropriate\nrestrictions that are no broader than necessary to protect the privacy interests of individuals\n\nApp.o39\nDOJ-OGR-oool9498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019507.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeR MOB 2o oST e Deter? 29-o2 OF RSS B7E27 2o9 PAgef 4 Hb l3\nincluding any social media website or other publicly available\nmedium.\n\n6.

Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019517.jpg": "OGsedl ADA S BOs ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 62728/PAg Kalyeisi B67\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity. The\ncriminal appeal concerns a denial of Maxwell’s motion to modify a protective order while the civil\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool969o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019702.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Page9 of l9\n(Entered: o7/27/2o2o)\n\no7/27/2o2o 32 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on 3l LETTER by USA as to\nGhislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v.

Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019871.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl2o 2F il G@ OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgec8 26o.o\n\nIn addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that\nwould enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government’s investigation to date, the\nGovernment has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> more than l5 different bank accounts held by or associated with the\ndefendant from 2ol6 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those\naccounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $2o\nmillion. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as\nrecently as 2ol9. For example, the defendant transferred $5oo,ooo from one of her accounts to\nanother in March 2ol9, and transferred more than $3oo,ooo from one of her accounts to another\nin July 2ol9. She has also reported, including as recently as 2ol9, that she holds one or more\nforeign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars.\n\nThe defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2ol6 property sale.\nIn particular, in 2ol6, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $l5\nmillion through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling\nmore than $l4 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as\nthe ouner. Several days later, more than $l4 million was transferred from that account into\nanother account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s financial resources\nappear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her\ntotal financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to\nthe Government.\n* The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring\nbetween 2oo7 and 2oll, approximately more than $2o million was transferred from accounts\nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in\nthe millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with\nEpstein.\n\nPi\nDOJ-OGR-oool987l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019905.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo8BoHAEN ISaCuMeht 2o2 FileensA3G/PtagPageB26ol9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding.

Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral.

And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019930.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page7l of 2oo 8\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl arranged for a live video feed of this proceeding to be set up\n2 in the jury assembly room at the courthouse.

(See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54).

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl.

To\nallou her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy\nunderpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, lol\nF.3d at 25l.!\n\nThe Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant\nwithout a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to\nthis Court. Alternatively, the Court can follou the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief\n“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,\nthe court may: (l) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it\nwould grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a\nsubstantial issue.” Houever, the defendant should not be permited to simultaneously pursue bail\nin both this Court and the Second Circuit.\n\nWil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail\nDecisions\n\nEven if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be\ndenied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,\n' While the Government has not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court\nis confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not\npresently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by\nthe Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an\nappeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on\na motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d l74, l8o n.5 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (“The district\ncourt could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second\nCircuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,\nwhile the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should\nnot grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal\nRules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a\nreading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party\nentitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of\nconviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in\nthe court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 2l4 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2ooo), the Second Circuit found\nthat Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal\nfrom the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of\nconviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after\na notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court\nof appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not\nbe necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the\nbail appeal is pending.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020180.jpg": "CaSast: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\nConceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case\n\nAs Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has\ncontinuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and\nactual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and nou to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.\nl65 at l.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes.

For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3.

With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed.

Among other things,\nthe Superseding Indictment expanded the scope of the conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three from l994 through 2oo4 and specifically <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a fourth\nvictim of those conspiracies.

Given these accommodations, Maxwell’s argument amounts to a\nsuggestion that any defendant in a case with voluminous discovery must be released\non bail to prepare for trial, regardless of flight risk or danger to the community. That\ncannot be the law.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020426.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page4o of 9l\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020527.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page4l of 92\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). Similarly, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has shoun that Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I should be filed under seal. With\nrespect to Exhibit C, houever, the Court concludes that narrouly tailored redactions\nare sufficient to advance the privacy interests the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>.\nAccordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with defense counsel and\nsubmit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 2o, 2o2l.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-l426\nDear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,\n\nIam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel\nfor Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknouledgement and Notice of Appearance on July l5, 2o22. The\nClerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any\ninformation concerning the transcripts.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), the ready date for this case was July l5, 2o22.\nAccordingly, I have until July 29, 2o22, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local\nRule 3l.2(a)(l)(A), I can request no more than 9l days from the ready date as the deadline for\nfiling Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October l4, 2o22.\n\nPursuant to Local Rule 3l.2(a)(l)(D), houever, I am permited to request a later deadline\nto file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.\nI request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 3o, 2o23, for the\nfollouing reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the rule. First, as noted,\nI am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As\nnew counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to\nprovide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the\nrecord is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings,\nvoir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists\nof 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in\nlimine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct\nmy oun research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance\nof prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size\nof Appellant’s Brief. Fourth, I have not been able to meet with my client as she was prematurely\ntransferred to Tallahassee, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past weekend, a\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020604.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 4o, ol/l2/2o23, 345l92o, Page3 of 4\ndeadline of January 3o, 2o23, is the difficulty we have had communicating with our client who\nis incarcerated in Tallahassee, Florida, with limited phone access.\n\n8.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\ndisclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020666.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Page48 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nno additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges\nthe MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The\nCourt also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell\nis subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her\nsafety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the\ntreatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The Government shall provide a copy\nof this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed\nby Judge Alison J.

See United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995).\nSimilarly, the Court concludes that the Government has shoun that Exhibits E, F, G, H,\nand I should be filed under seal.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

See Dkt. No. 698. With one\nexception, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to\nprotect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 4l2 and the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals subject to the Court's pseudonym order, and individuals who were\nanticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately called. See Lugosch\nv. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will file unredacted\ncopies of all items under seal. The Court concludes, houever, that the proposed\nredactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not narrouly tailored. The private information of victim-\nwitnesses who are discussed in the leter may be protected by narrou redactions.\nHouever, there is no basis to redact the leter's general request to identify the proper\nscope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is ORDERED to confer with the\nGovernment and docket proposed revised redactions on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday,\nJuly l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal at Dkt. No. 7l2.\nBecause the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 7l2 from the docket. The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

During these interactions, which took\nplace between approximately l994 and l997, MAXWELL groomed Minor\nVictim-l to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple\nmeans. First, MAXWELL and Epstein atempted to befriend Minor\nVictim-ll, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips.\nMAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-l about school, her classes, her\nfamily, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to\nnormalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other\nthings, undressing in front of Minor Victim-l and being present\nwhen Minor Victim-l undressed in front of Epstein.

Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed.\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, $5l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nis\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020799.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel8l of 2o8\nA-l77\n~ Case l:lo-cv-2l586-ASG Document l-3 Entered on FLSD Docket o5/l7/2olo Page 5ofl5 _\nproposed agreements with the State Atomey’s Office prior to entering\ninte those agreements.\n\nTe The United States shall provide Epstein's atorneys with a list of\nindividuals whom it has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims, as defined in l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, after Epstein has signed this agreement and been sentenced.\nUpon the execution of this agreement, the United States, in consultation\nwith and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein’s counsel, shall\nselect an atorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for\nby Epstein.

Yet Kellen received far less atention than other conspirators\nin the Government’s case, being mentioned only briefly in the Government’s opening statement\nand closing arguments. /.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,\ntoo”). Conspiracies often change membership without forming a new, distinct conspiracy,\nparticularly if key members of the conspiracy remain over the course of a decade. See United\nStates v.

The time periods of the two counts overlap completely. Namely, Count\nFive’s period of 2ool to 2oo4 is “wholly within the time frame” of Count Three from l994 to\n2oo4, which substantially favors the Defendant on this Korfant factor. United States v.\nCalderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47 (2d Cir. l992). The Government’s atempt to minimize this factor\nby noting that most overt acts for Count Three occurred in the l99os is simply not reflected in\nthis circuit’s case law. See, e.g., Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing on the overlap in time frame\nalleged in the indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference that one conspiracy\nwholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor.

The NPA required Epstein to make a binding\nrecommendation that the state court sentence him to serve l8 months in the county jail folloued\nby l2 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included\nprovisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In\nexchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in\nthe Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential\nco-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or\nthe NPA prior to its signing.\n\nThe signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,\nhouever. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent atorneys\nto try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously\nseeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no\nfederal interest at issue and the mater should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement\nofficials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,\ndefense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and\nobtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a\nquintessentially state mater.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on\nJune 23, 2oo8, the Office of the Deputy Atorney General informed defense counsel that the\nDeputy Atorney General would not intervene in the mater. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill\nhis obligation under the NPA, and on June 3o, 2oo8, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to\nthe pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,\nto a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.\nUpon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the\ncourt immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of l2 months’ incarceration on the\nsolicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, folloued by l2 months\nof community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm\nBeach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, a victim, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein\nwithout consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to\nthe petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did\nnot produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective\norder; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” Nevertheless, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI.

OPR also collected\nand reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also\nexamined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and\nother court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books\nrelating to the Epstein case.\n\nIn addition to this extenstve documentary review, OPR conducted more than 6o interviews\nof witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;\ncurrent and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former Department atorneys and senior\nmanagers, including a former Deputy Atorney General and a former Assistant Atorney General\nfor the Criminal Division; and the former State Atorney and former Assistant State Atorney in\ncharge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and atorneys\nrepresenting victims, and reviewed writen submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and the FBI.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> former U.S. Atorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the\nAUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of\nthem was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations\nleading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department atorney to be a subject of\nits investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result\nin a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta\nand another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested.\nthat all of the subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement in the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim\nnotification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed writen responses from all of the\nsubjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before\na court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant\ncontemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and\nprovided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR\n6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2ol8, to January 25, 2ol9.

The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nxl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021194.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page22 of 258\nSA-2o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 348\nI.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021224.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N5o 3536o38, Paged2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\n\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*° According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled interstate to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021233.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ae ye ae 3536o38, Page6l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 59 of 348\nfor meetings was to cause delay, but “the people in my office either couldn’t see that or didn’t\nwant to see that,” perhaps because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” or a\nmisguided belief “that [Epstein’s] atorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told\nOPR that she “could not seem to get [her supervisors] to understand the seriousness of Epstein’s\nbehavior and the fact that he was probably continuing to commit the behavior, and that there was\na need to move with necessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafafia folloued the guidance of her\nimmediate supervisor and did not send the email.\n\nLike Lourie, Menchel told OPR that he believed meeting with defense counsel was good\npractice. Menchel told OPR that he saw “no dounside” to hearing the defense point of view.\nDefense counsel might make a persuasive point “that’s actually going to change our mind,” or\nalternatively, present arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the case went forward, and\nMenchel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to learn about such arguments in advance.\nMenchel also told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia ever articulating a concern that Epstein was\ncontinuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view, Epstein was “already under a microscope, at least in\nFlorida,” and it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to offend in those\ncircumstances.\n\nE, June 2oo7: Villafafia Supplements the Prosecution Memorandum\n\nWhile Villafafia’s supervisors were considering whether to go forward with the proposed\ncharges, Villafafia took additional steps to support them. On June l4, 2oo7, she supplemented the\nprosecution memorandum with an addendum addressing “credibility concerns” relating to one of\nthe victims. In the email transmiting the addendum to Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her\nimmediate supervisor, Villafafia reported, “another Jane Doe has been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and interviewed,”\nand the “different strategies” about hou to structure the charges left Villafafia unsure whether “to\nmake... changes nou or wait until we have received approval of the current charging strategy.”\nThe addendum itself related to a particular victim referred to as the minor who “saw Epstein most\nfrequently” and who had allegedly engaged in sexual activity with both Epstein and an Epstein\nassistant. In the addendum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> documents she had found corroborating four\nseparate statements made by this victim.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that the only victim about whom any supervisor ever articulated\nspecific credibility issues was the victim discussed in the addendum. Lourie told OPR that he had\nno specific recollection of the addendum, but it was “reasonable” to assume that the addendum\naddressed one particular victim because no one had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> specific concerns relating to any\nother victim. Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told OPR that to her recollection, the\ndiscussions about credibility issues were generic rather than tied to specific victims.\n\nF. The June 26, 2oo7 Meeting with Defense Counsel\n\nMenchel agreed to meet with defense counsel on June 26, 2oo7, communicating directly\nwith Sanchez about the arrangements. At Menchel’s instruction, on June l8, 2oo7, Villafafia sent\na leter to defense counsel identifying what she described as “the statutes under consideration.”*!\nod Villafafia sent copies of this leter to both Menchel and Sanchez. Villafafia told OPR that she objected to\nsending this information to the defense. Although Menchel did not recall directing Villafafia to send the leter to\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021234.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 6o 3536o38, Page62 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6o of 348\nOn that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and her immediate supervisor\ncomplaining that she had received no reply to her query about making changes to the proposed\nindictment and asking again for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that\nVillafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than. . . everybody\nelse,” but Acosta was still considering what strategy to pursue. Sloman told OPR that he did not\nknou whether Villafafia received any response to her request, but he believed that at that point in\ntime, Menchel and Lourie were evaluating the case to make a decision about hou to proceed.\n\nThe day before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmited to the USAO a\nl9-page leter intended to provide “an overview of our position and the materials we plan to present\nin order to demonstrate that none of the statutes <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by you can rightly be applied to the\nconduct at issue here.” Reiterating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly\ncontested the appropriateness of federal involvement in the mater. Among other issues, Lefcourt’s\nleter argued:\n\ne Voluntary sexual activity involving “young adults—l6 or l7 years of age’—was\n“strictly a state concern.”\n\ne Federal statutes were not meant to apply to circumstances in which the defendant\nreasonably believed that the person with whom he engaged in sexual activity was\nl8 years of age.\n\ne One of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was\nintended to address use of the internet to prey upon child victims through “internet\ntrolling,” but Epstein did not use the internet to lure victims.\n\ne The “travel” statute, l8 U.S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”\nengaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Epstein traveled to Florida to visit family,\noversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of\ndaily living.”\n\nLefcourt also argued again that “irregularities” had tainted the state’s case and would “have a\nsignificant impact on any federal prosecution.”*”\n\nLourie sent to Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments\ninto “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie disagreed with the argument that l8 U.S.C. § 2422(b)\nwas limited to “internet trolling,” and described this as “our best charge and the most defensible\nfor federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument that Epstein did not\ntravel to Florida “‘with the purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex with a minor was more persuasive.\nLefcourt, he told OPR that he ‘“wouldn’t take issue” with Villafafia’s claim that he had done so. Menchel also told\nOPR that he did not recall Villafafia objecting at that point to providing the information to the defense.\n\n52 Lefcourt claimed there were deficiencies in the PBPD search warrant and “material misstatements and\nomissions” in the PBPD probable cause affidavit. As an example, he contended that the police had lacked probable\ncause to search for videotapes, “since all the women who were asked whether they had been videotaped denied\nknouledge of any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021244.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page/2 of 258\nSA-7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7o of 348\ne-mail that I would like to address, and I also would like to address\nwhere we are in the case.\nFirst, I wanted to address the comment about jumping the chain of\ncommand.

Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer equipment.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum\nterm of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution, The Office has\nnever agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we\nsimply stated that if Mr. Epstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal penctentiary, we\nwould be willing to explore a federal conviction that may allou that in lieu of any state\nresolution.

Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed\nconcern about proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafafia, Belohlavek\nexplained that a plea to the three state counts <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the draft NPA would affect the state’s\nsentencing guidelines, and that it would be beter for the guidelines calculation if Epstein pled\nguilty to just one of the three counts. Villafafia recalled that when Belohlavek confirmed that\nEpstein would be required to register as a sexual offender if he pled to any one of the three charges,\nLourie, speaking for the USAO, agreed to allou Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge\nin addition to the pending state indictment, and the defense atorneys selected the charge of\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution.!°° Lourie, houever, disputed Villafafia’s\nrecollection that he made the final decision, stating that it was “illogical” to conclude that he had\nthe authority to change the terms of agreement unilaterally. ©’\n\nDuring the meeting, defense counsel raised concerns about Epstein serving time in state\nprison. Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie, the other supervisor, and she made clear during the\nmeeting that they expected Epstein to be incarcerated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, during\nthe entirety of his sentence, and they did not “particularly care” whether it was in a state or local\nfacility. Belohlavek explained to OPR that in order for Epstein to serve his time in a county\nfacility, rather than state prison, his sentence on each charge could be no more than l2 months, so\nthat, for example, consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months—totaling l8 months—could be\nserved in the county jail. Villafafia told OPR:\n\nOur thing was incarceration 24 hours a day. So during this meeting,\n\nI remember [the defense] talking about... a one year count folloued\n\nby a six-month count . .. that [Epstein] could serve them back to\n\nback but at the county jail, rather than having to go to a state facility.\n\nBut then I said, “But if you do that, it’s still going to have to be round\n\nthe clock incarceration.” And Barry Krischer said yes. And [he]\n\nsaid that to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he\n\nwould be kept in solitary confinement.\nVillafafia did not recall whether she and Lourie agreed to an l8-month sentence during that\nmeeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allouing Epstein to serve his sentence in the county\njail was not a “concession” because he would be incarcerated regardless.\n\nNeither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could recall any substantive details\nof the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek told OPR they did not remember\nthe meeting at all. Krischer did, houever, recall that he was “not offended at all” when he learned\nof the proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein to plead to both the pending state indictment\nand an additional charge requiring sexual offender registration, explaining to OPR that Epstein\n“was going to plead guilty to my indictment, we were going to add an additional charge, he was\nlo6 Later, the defense would claim that they had mistakenly understood that the selected charge would not\ninvolve sexual offender registration.\n\nlo7 As noted belou, a contemporaneous email indicates that shortly after the meeting, Lourie and Villafafia spoke\nwith Acosta and Sloman, who concurred with the agreement.\n65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of restitution, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case.

Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process.

Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.’\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 38\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.

In a December 2oo7 leter\nto Sanchez, Acosta stated that he had “swa sponte proposed the Addendum to Mr. Lefkouitz at an\nOctober meeting in Palm Beach .... in an atempt to avoid what I foresaw would likely be a\nlitigious selection process.”'*?

Lefkouitz noted, houever, that\nEpstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense\nleter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkouitz\nadded:\n\nI also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during\nour October l2 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with\nregard to this mater, and assured me that your Office would not\nintervene with the State Atorney’s Office regarding this mater; or\ncontact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals, potential witnesses, or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding\nthe sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,\nso long as that sentence does not violate state law.

U.S. Atorneys Have Broad Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as\n\nThey Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision to Decline to Prosecute\nEpstein Federally Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct\n\nThe U.S. Atorneys exercise broad discretion in enforcing the nation’s criminal laws.7°\nAs a general mater, federal prosecutors “are designated by statute as the President’s delegates to\nhelp him discharge his constitutional responsibility to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully\nexecuted.’” United States v. Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. 456, 464 (l996) (quoting U.S. Const. art. IL,\n§ 3). Unless based on an impermissible standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\nclassification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not dictated by law\nor statute and are not subject to judicial review. See United States v. LaBonte, 52o U.S. 75l, 762\n(l997) (“Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate,\nso long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).\n\nDepartment policy guidance in effect at the time the USAO was handling the Epstein case\nhelped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but did not require “a particular\nprosecutorial decision in any given case.” USAM §§ 9-27.ool, 9-27.l2o (comment). Rather than\nmandating specific actions, the USAM <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> considerations that should factor into a\nprosecutor’s charging decisions, including that the defendant was “subject to effective prosecution\nin another jurisdiction.” USAM § 9-27.22o. Importantly, U.S. Atorneys had “plenary authority\nwith regard to federal criminal maters” and could modify or depart from the principles set forth\nin the USAM as deemed necessary in the interest of fair and effective law enforcement within their\nindividual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.ool, 9-27.l4o. As stated in the USAM, “[t]he United\nStates Atorney is invested by statute and delegation from the Atorney General with the broadest\ndiscretion in the exercise of such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority to decline\nprosecution. USAM § 9-2.ool.\n\nIn addition, the USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline\nfederal prosecution in deference to a state prosecution of the same conduct and provided guidance\nin the form of factors to be considered in making the decision, including the strength of the other\njurisdiction’s interest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute\neffectively, and the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted in the other\njurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.24o.7° A comment to this provision stated that the factors are\n“illustrative only, and the atorney for the government should also consider any others that appear\nrelevant to hi[m]/her in a particular case.”\n\n2o8 See, eg., Wayte,47o U.S. at 6o7; United States v.

See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it\nwas signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding\nany arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.\nFurthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Atorney from deferring to a\nstate prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state\ncharges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that alloued Epstein\nto resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an l8-month state sentence did\nnot violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional\nmisconduct.\n\n2. The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential\nCo-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous\nDepartment Policy\n\nSeveral witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute\nunidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the\nwitnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a\nwitness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of\nthe witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from\nprosecution altogether and is relatively rare.\n\nOPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Atorney from declining to prosecute third parties\nor providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied\nonly to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth\nAmendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.loo e¢ seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity\nalso address the same context. See l8 U.S.C. § 6oo2; 2l U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from\nvoluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not\nto prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,\ne.g., Marquez, 9o9 F.2d at 74l-43; Kemp, 76o F.2d at l248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 9o9; Frazier,\n697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s\nagreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,’ and therefore cannot conclude that\nnegotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nNotwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of\nAcosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its\npotential consequences, including to whom it would apply.\n\nl39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021340.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ANG6G 3536o38, Pagel68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l66 of 348\n3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to Deportation\nof Criminal Aliens\nDuring the negotiations, the USAO rejected a defense-offered provision prohibiting the\n\nUSAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration authorities to\n\ninstitute immigration proceedings” against two female assistants. Houever, OPR considered\n\nwhether the April 28, l995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute\n\nEpstein’s two female assistants who were knoun to be foreign nationals—as Villafafia urged in\n\nher prosecution memorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded\n\nthe USAO from agreeing not to prosecute them as part of a negotiated resolution. OPR found\nnothing in the policy that created a clear and unambiguous standard in either regard.\n\nThe Atorney General’s April 28, l995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal\nAliens” directed federal prosecutors to become involved actively and directly in the process of\nremoving criminal aliens from the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.52o, provided that\n“Tall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”\nHouever, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportable” unless and until convicted of a crime that\nwould have triggered their removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM imposed\nan obligation on the USAO to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did\neither provision preclude the USAO from declining to prosecute an alien using the same broad\ndiscretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.\n\nThe policy guidance also requires “prompt and close coordination” with immigration\nofficials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration\nauthorities before engaging in plea negotiations with alien defendants. OPR learned during its\ninvestigation that an ICE agent participated in the Epstein investigation in its early stages.\nMoreover, because the USAO never engaged in plea negotiations with the two female assistants,\nwho, in any event, had not been charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further\nnotification was required.\n\nIV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE\nINFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS\nFAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO\nEPSTEIN\nOPR investigated whether any of the subjects—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or\n\nVillafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,\n\nstatus, or political associations, to include terms in the NPA that were favorable to Epstein, or\n\nwhether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the federal investigation. OPR\nconsidered the case-specific reasons the subjects <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as the motivation for the USAO’s\n\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA in September 2oo7. OPR also\n\nthoroughly examined various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were\n\nmotivated by improper influences, including the subjects’ preexisting relationships with defense\n\ncounsel; the subjects’ numerous meetings with Epstein’s team of nationally knoun atorneys;\n\nemails between the subjects—particularly Villafafia—and defense counsel that appeared friendly,\n\ncasual, and deferential to defense counsel; and inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining\n\nl4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021341.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I67 3536o38, Pagel69 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 348\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7°°\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA, OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021344.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel72 of 258\nSA-l7o\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021345.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel73 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\n\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].””°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved. And most of them wanted the case\nto be resolved via a plea. Some of them wanted him not to be\nprosecuted at all. Most of them did not want to have to come to\ncourt and testify. They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.7'©\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l6 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible disclosure of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing disclosure of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021350.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel78 of 258\nSA-l76\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l76 of 348\nreconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely\nif his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s atorneys.\n\nSecond, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the\nagreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the\ninvestigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly atacking the NPA in his submissions to the\nDepartment, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of\nmisconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction\nwith the NPA, and his personal atacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the\nagreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s\nbenefit.\n\nD. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense\n\nCounsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors\nEstablished That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided\nImproper Benefits to Epstein\n\nIn evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media\naccounts to shou that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly\nsuggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did\nnot find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other\nimproper motivation.\n\nl. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any\nImproper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships\nwith His Atorneys\n\nEpstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple atorneys who had preexisting personal\nconnections to some of the government atorneys involved in his case, in the State Atorney’s\nOffice, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the atorneys Epstein selected\nto represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring atorneys\nwith relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first atorneys who\ncontacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Atorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was\nclose friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former\nAUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein\nwas seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz, prominent atorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from\nhis previous employment with that firm.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s\natorneys.” Critically, houever, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in\nthe follouing subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an\nimproper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or\nfor any other improper reason). Villafafia explained hou, in her view, the “legal prouess” of\nEpstein’s atorneys had an impact on the case:\n\nl5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021361.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel89 of 258\nSA-l87\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l87 of 348\n\nproof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkouitz and Acosta shou\nthat it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the\nbreakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkouitz (copying Acosta and Villafafia),\nnoting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the\naddendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the atorney representative. Sloman later\nclarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”\n\nA second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s\nobligation under the NPA to pay the atorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the\nfees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s\ninterpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the\nprovision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast\nmeeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned\natorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein\nunder § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that\nAcosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.\n\nOPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta\nand Lefkouitz. In a leter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2oo7, two weeks after the breakfast\nmeeting, Lefkouitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.\nSpecifically, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (l) not to intervene with the State\nAtorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their\ncounsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that\nhe did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense\ncounsel atributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkouitz was not a reliable narrator of\nevents, and on several occasions in writen communications had inaccurately and misleadingly\ncharacterized conversations he had with Acosta.\n\nOf more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an\nOctober 25, 2oo7 draft response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed\nand edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkouitz’s claims. The draft leter stated:\n\nI specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was\ninaccurate in that October 23rd leter. Your leter claimed that this\nOffice\nwould not intervene with the State Atorney’s Office\nregarding this mater; or contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil\nclaimants and their respective counsel in this mater;\nand neither your Office nor the [FBI] would\nintervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein\nreceives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as\nthat sentence does not violate state law.\n\nAs we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States\nAtorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a\nl6l\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l36l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021367.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l93 3536o38, Pagel95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l93 of 348\nVillafafia had raised (defense counsel’s atempt to insert an immigration waiver into the\nagreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-\nconspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the\ngovernment’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for\n“Ta]ny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no\ndocument that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other\nindividuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate\nsupervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,\nand Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told\nOPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-\nprosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision\nagreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that\ndefense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame\nfor what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct\nwas his oun “dirty litle secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2oo6\narrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that\nnone of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators\nabout sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-knoun contacts about whom allegations arose\nmany years later.”3° Villafafia acknouledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime\nrelationship with a close female friend who was a well-knoun socialite, but, according to\nVillafafia, in 2oo7, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.””*? Accordingly, Villafafia\nbelieved that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the\nfour female assistants <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s\ninvestigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he\nentered a plea.**! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,\nshe perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified\n“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did\nnot occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any\nof Epstein’s influential associates.\n\nLourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the\ntime Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR\nthat he did not knou hou the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.\n238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of... the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being\ninvolved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\n239 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct\ninvolving the then minor did not occur in Florida.\n\nas) The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one\ngirl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the\ngovernment’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself\nbelieved to also have been at one time a victim.\n\neal Villatafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l367\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain cooperation, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ cooperation against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>.

I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else.

This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor.

Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\n\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021395.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o38, Page223 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22l of 348\nvictim/witness staff were “ready to assist you with the details of victim notification, and other\nareas for which United States Atorney[’]s Offices are nou explicitly responsible under the act.”\nThe USAO’s Victim Witness Program Coordinator told OPR that the USAO provided annual\nmandatory office-wide training on victim/witness issues and training for new employees.\n\nB. The Automated Victim Notification System\n\nBoth the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victim\nNotification System (VNS), an automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United\nStates Atorneys. The 2oo5 Guidelines mandated that “victim contact information and notice to\nvictims of events ... shall, absent exceptional circumstances (such as cases involving juvenile or\nforeign victims), be conducted and maintained using VNS.” The VNS is separate from agency\ncase management systems maintained by the FBI and the USAO. Both the FBI and the USAO\nuse the VNS to generate form leters to victims at various points in the investigation and the\nprosecution of a criminal case. Although each form leter can be augmented to add some limited\nindividual mater-specific content, the leters contain specific language concerning the purpose of\nthe contact that cannot be removed (such as the arrest of the defendant or the scheduling of a\nsentencing hearing).””!\n\nIn the usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information during\nthe investigation stage, which it stores in its case management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist\nexports the victim information data from the FBI’s case management system into the VNS\ndatabase. Victim information stored in the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VNS case number.\nAt the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim Specialist could use the VNS to generate\nseven different form notification leters: (l) initial notification; (2) case is under investigation;\n(3) arrest of the defendant; (4) declination of prosecution; (5) other; (6) advice of victim rights;\nand (7) investigation closed.\n\nAfter a charging document has been filed and the “prosecution stage” begins, the USAO’s\nVictim Witness Specialist assumes responsibility for victim notification.?”” The USAO imports\ndata from its case management system into the VNS and links to the previously loaded FBI VNS\ndata. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist uses the VNS to generate form leters providing\nnotice of case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed plea agreement; change of\nplea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.\na U.S. Dept. of Justice Office of the Inspector General Audit Division Audit Report o8-o4, The Department of\nJustice’s Victim Notification System at 29 (Jan. 2oo8), available at htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/EOUS A/ao8o4/\nfinal.pdf. The 2oo8 audit <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> concerns with the VNS templates, including that ““VNS users . . . cannot alter the\nformat to ensure that it fits with the specific case for which it is being sent,” and many users had noted that “information\nin notifications became confusing and sometimes contradictory when various types of notifications were combined in\nthe same leter.”\n\n272 The FBI and the USAO have different titles for the individual who maintains victim contact: the FBI title is\n“Victim Specialist,” and the USAO title is “Victim Witness Specialist.”\nl95\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l395\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021396.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 399 3536o38, Page224 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 222 of 348\n\nC. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that\nbriefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-\nwitness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents\nnationwide routinely folloued a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for\nVictims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for\nVictims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:\n“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,\nand it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you\nare afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided\nvictims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The\nDepartment of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and\ninstructions on hou to access the system.\n\nV. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS\n\nA. August 2oo6: The FBI Victim Notification Leters\n\nOn August 8, 2oo6, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim\nSpecialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim\nNotification Form” naming 3o victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional\npertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.?” Thereafter, the Victim Specialist\nentered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS\nwhenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial leter to a particular\nvictim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the\n[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”\n\nAccording to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2oo6, the FBI Victim Specialist\nused the VNS to generate FBI leters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the\neight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive\ncurrent status information about the mater. The FBI leters described the case as “currently under\ninvestigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued\npatience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The leters also stated that some of the\nCVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts\nto ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring\nafter the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility\nof the prosecuting United States Atorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A\nsample leter follous.\nas These 3o were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not\ndesignated as victims and individuals the PBPD had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> but not interviewed.\naH The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as\nfar as anything pertaining to victim rights .. . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from\n[her], the Victim Specialist.”\n\nl96\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA. The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021402.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 358 3536o38, Page23o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 228 of 348\nfor some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall,\nmany of the victims were troubled about the existence of the\ninvestigation. They displayed feelings of embarrassment and\nhumiliation and were reluctant to talk to investigators. Some\nvictims who were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the investigation refused even\nto speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and\ngeting to the truth were always at the forefront of our handling of\nthe investigation.\nThe case agent told OPR that although she encountered victims who were “strong” and\n“believable,” she did not encounter any who vigorously advocated for the prosecution of Epstein.\nRather, “they were embarrassed,” “didn’t want their parents to knou,” and “wanted to forget.”?*\nAs of September 24, 2oo7, the date the NPA was signed, Villafafia informed Epstein\natorney Lefkouitz that she had compiled a preliminary list of victims including “34 confirmed\nminors” and 6 other potential minor victims who had not yet been interviewed by the FBI.7**\nAlthough the government had contacted many victims before the NPA was signed, Villafafia\nacknouledged during the CVRA litigation that “individual victims were not consulted regarding\nthe agreement.”\nB. Before the NPA Is Signed, Villafaia Expresses Concern That Victims Have\nNot Been Consulted\nBefore the NPA was signed, Villafafia articulated to her supervisors concerns about the\ngovernment’s failure to consult with victims.\nl. July 2oo7: Villafaia’s Email Exchanges with Menchel\nIn July 2oo7, Villafafia learned that Menchel had discussed with defense counsel Sanchez\na possible state resolution to the federal investigation of Epstein. Villafafia was upset by this\ninformation, and sent a strongly worded email to Menchel voicing her concerns. (A full account\nof their email exchange is set forth at Chapter Two, Part One, Section IV.A.2.) In that email, she\ntold him that it was “inappropriate [for you] to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE, the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate... all of the\n285 The case agent also noted that the victim who became CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 had expressed in her\nApril 2oo7 video-recorded FBI interview her opinion that “nothing should happen to Epstein.”\n284 The “victims’ list” for purposes of the NPA was intended to include the names of all individuals whom the\ngovernment was prepared to name in a charging document “‘as victims of an offense enumerated in l8 U.S.C. § 2255.”\nAlthough the charges Villafafia proposed on May l, 2oo7, were based on crimes against l3 victims, thereafter, as\nexplained in Chapter Two of this Report, she continued to revise the proposed charges, adding and removing victims\nas the federal investigation developed further evidence. At the time the NPA was signed, the proposed charges were\nbased on crimes against l9 victims, but others had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> for potential inclusion.\n2o2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021410.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 336. 3536o38, Page238 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 348\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°”°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021412.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 338 3536o38, Page24o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.3!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknouledged\nthat she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the\nagreement because “‘at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and\nthat we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”\n\nOn October l2, 2oo7, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice leter to a victim\nthe case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The\n\nState does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the\n\nCourt has to provide a separate room for victims who want to atend\n\njudicial proceedings, so I do not knou hou many victims will\n\nactually want to be present.3!!\nBelohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any\ncoordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s\nstate plea hearing.\n\nOn November l9, 2oo7, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from\nthe defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in\nwriting.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification leter, in which among other things,\ncae Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021413.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page24l of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 239 of 348\nshe would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s\nagreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve l8 months in county jail, and the victims’\nability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The leter also would invite victims to appear\nat the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a writen statement to be\nfiled by the State Atorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim\nnotification leter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t\nreceive the original leters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the leter for\nthose.”\n\nSloman informed Lefkouitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation\n(Justice for All Act of 2oo4) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their\nrights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by leter after COB\nThursday, November 29.” Lefkouitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that\nit was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4. He\nargued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission\nprior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification leters were\nsent to “victims, who still have not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein\nhas entered his plea” and that the leter should come from the atorney representative rather than\nthe government. On November 28, 2oo7, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkouitz\nwith the draft victim notification leter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was\nto occur on December l4, 2oo7.7\n\nIn a November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz strongly objected to the proposed draft\nnotification leter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any leter to victims until\nafter Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkouitz also contended that the victims had no right to\nappear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a writen statement for such a\nproceeding. In a November 3o, 2oo7 reply leter to Lefkouitz, Acosta did not address the\nsubstance of Lefkouitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting\ncollateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was\ndissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly\nthereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by leter that he had directed prosecutors “not to\nissue victim notification leters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time\nto review these options with your client.” In the leter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that\nVillafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary\ndamages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during\nthe investigation phase of this mater.”\n\nOn December 5, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz sent a leter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman\nand Assistant Atorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with\nail On November 28, 2oo7, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that\nonly l5 of the then-knoun victims had received victim notification leters from either the FBI or the USAO. On\nDecember 6, 2oo7, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W\nleters addressed to victims from the USAO.”\na3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December l4, 2oo7 date, and emailed them for\nconfirmation, stating, “[I]f the mater is set for the l4th, please let me knou so I can include that in my victim\nnotifications.”\n\n2l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021414.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34o 3536o38, Page242 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning restitution to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 343 3536o38, Page245 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\n\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\n\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.?”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan unrelated mater].

No more; no less.” Acosta also advised\nthat although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,\nthe USAO would leave to the State Atorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state\nproceedings:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing\nhearing.

We intend to provide\nvictims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We\nwill defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding whether\nhe wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,\nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do\nso if he wishes.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this leter without running it by [Sloman], if\nnot other individuals in the office,” and records shou he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.\nAcosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of\nwhether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the\nrole of the USAO, “to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state\noutcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the\nState Atorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to\nquestion that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not\nassume... that the State Atorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his\nunderstanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have\nan opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would\nB28 Sloman’s handwriten notes from a December 2l, 2oo7 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the\ndefense, “Are there concerns re: 377l lang[uage],” to which Lefkouitz replied, “The state should have their oun\nmechanism.” At the time of the Epstein mater, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded\nthe “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\na8 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[nJothing was provided.”\na Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, {lol (June 6, 2ol7).\n23o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l43o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021434.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA 958 3536o39, Page4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 258 of 348\n\nVillafafia told OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reiter a list of the victims,\nincluding their telephone numbers, to notify and asked him to destroy the list.

Villafafia did not recall being “asked [to] provide a list of all our victims to the\nState Atorney’s Office.”\n\nIn his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter stated that Villafafia sent him a leter “around the time of\nsentencing,” listing the victims in the federal investigation, and that she asked him to destroy the\nleter after he reviewed it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was aware that the\nstate grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not include all of the victims that the PBPD had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> and he “wanted to make sure that some prosecution body had considered all of our\n\n$ ee 99353\nvictims.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she and the PBPD\n“atempted to notify the victims about [the June 3o] hearing in the short time available to us.”3°*\nIn her 2oo8 declaration, houever, Villafafia conceded that “all knoun victims were not notified.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that Edwards was the only victim atorney she was authorized to\ncontact—she thought probably by Sloman—about the June 3o, 2oo8 plea hearing because Edwards\n“had expressed a specific interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “I was told that I could\ninform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform him of the NPA.”*°° In her 2oo8\ndeclaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that she called Edwards and informed him of\nthe plea hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that Edwards told her that he could not\natend the hearing but “someone” would be present.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.

Later that day, Villafafia met with Goldberger and gave him the list of 3l individuals\nthe government was prepared to name as victims and to whom the § 2255 provision applied.\n\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA case declaration, Wild stated that, “I did not have any reason to atend\nthat hearing because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the FBI’s investigation\nof Epstein’s abuse of me.” She stated that she “would have atended and tried to object to the\nJudge and prevent that plea from going forward,” had she knoun that the state plea “had some\nconnection to blocking the prosecution of my case.” Similarly, CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2\nstated that “no one notified me that [Epstein’s] plea had anything to do with my case against him.”\n\nAn atorney who represented several victims, including one whom the state had\nsubpoenaed for the potential July trial, told OPR that he was present in court on June 3o, 2oo8, in\norder to serve a complaint upon Epstein in connection with a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of\none of his clients. The USAO had not informed him about the plea hearing.*°* Moreover, the\natorney informed OPR that, although one of the victims he represented had been interviewed in\nthe PBPD’s investigation and had been deposed by Epstein’s atorneys in the state case (with the\nAssistant State Atorney present), he did not recall receiving any notice of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea\nhearing from the State Atorney’s Office.°® Similarly, another of the victims the state had\nsubpoenaed for the July trial told OPR through her atorney that she received subpoenas from the\nState Atorney’s Office, but she was not invited to or aware of the state plea hearing.

July 7, 2oo8: The CVRA Litigation Is Initiated\n\nOn July 3, 2oo8, victims’ atorney Edwards spoke to Villafafia by telephone about the\nresolution of the state case against Epstein “and the next stage of the federal prosecution.”°°’ In\nhis 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, Edwards asserted that during this conversation,\nVillafafia did not inform him of the NPA, but that during the call, he sensed that the USAO “was\nbeginning to negotiate with Epstein concerning the federally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> crimes.” Houever, in an\nemail Villafafia sent after the call, she informed Sloman that during the call, Edwards stated that\n“his clients can name many more victims and wanted to knou if we can get out of the deal.”\nVillafafia told Sloman that after she told Edwards that the government was bound by the\nagreement, assuming Epstein completed it, Edwards asked that “if there is the slightest bit of\nhesitation on Epstein’s part of completing his performance, that he and his [three] clients be\nalloued to consult with [the USAO] before making a decision.”3°°\n\nThat same day, Edwards wrote a leter to Villafafia, complaining that Epstein’s state court\nsentence was “grossly inadequate for a predator of this magnitude” and urged Villafafia to “move\nforward with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes\nMr. Epstein has commited.”\n\nOn July 7, 2oo8, Edwards filed his emergency petition in the U.S. District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida on behalf of Courtney Wild, who was then <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> only as “Jane\nDoe.” She was soon joined by a second petitioner, and they were respectively referred to as “Jane\nDoe l” and “Jane Doe 2.”\"°° Edwards claimed that the government had violated his clients’ rights\nunder the CVRA by negotiating to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein without consulting\nwith the victims.

Villafafia also informed the defense that, beginning the follouing day, she would distribute\nnotifications to each of the 32 victims and their counsel informing them that Epstein’s atorney\nwould be the contact for any civil litigation, if the victim decided to pursue damages. Finally, the\nleter informed the defense that the government would consider a denial by Epstein that any “one\nof these victims is entitled to proceed under l8 U.S.C. § 2255” to be considered a breach of the\nterms of the NPA.\n\nAfter exchanging emails and leters with the defense concerning the content of the notice\nleter, Villafafia drafted a leter she sent, on July 9 and lo, to nine victims who had previously\nretained counsel. The leter informed the victims and their counsel that, “[i]n light of’ Epstein’s\nJune 3o, 2oo8 state court plea to felony solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, and his sentence of a total of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by l2\nmonths’ community control, “the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of\nthis state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions.” The leter included a reference to the\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 provision of the NPA, and although the defense had never agreed to it, used\nlanguage from Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein defense atorney Sanchez clarifying\nthe damages provision. The paragraph belou was described as “[o]ne such condition to which\nEpstein has agreed”:\n\nAny person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an\noffense enumerated in Title l8, United States Code, Section 2255,\nwill have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she\nwould have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and\nconvicted of an enumerated offense.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States.

Villatfafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021441.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 565 3536o39, Pagell of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.5 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*”> As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\nae Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\ncual The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\nBia This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021444.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 568 3536o39, Pagel4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 268 of 348\n\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”>*?\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l444\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021454.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page24 of 2l7\nSA-278\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\nprospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*”\n\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS <span class=\"highlight\">IDENTIFIED</span> IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning restitution to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue.

At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\n<span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021472.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document “EN 396 3536o39, Page42 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 296 of 348\n\nthe PBPD during its investigation into Epstein’s conduct. Absent information from the USAO,\nthe state would not have been in a position to notify those additional victims of the state plea\nproceeding, even if the State Atorney had decided to include other victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nstate investigation. Furthermore, at the time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised\nby Villafafia that Belohlavek, in November 2oo7, had requested that the USAO notify victims,\npresumably those <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the federal investigation, about the state plea hearing.\n\nAcosta told OPR that it had been his understanding at the time of Epstein’s plea that the\nvictims would be made aware of the proceeding and would have an opportunity to speak. Acosta\nalso told OPR that he expected the state would have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-\nencompassing plea, that the state court sentence would also mean that the federal government was\nnot proceeding.” There is no evidence, houever, that he verified this understanding with Sloman\nor Villafafia, let alone the State Atorney. OPR found no indication that Acosta ever\ncommunicated, or directed Sloman or Villafafia to communicate, his decision to the State Atorney\nor to provide the State Atorney’s Office with a complete list of victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during the\nfederal investigation. OPR located a draft leter to the State Atorney’s Office that Villafafia\nprepared and forwarded to Acosta in December 2oo7, which did provide such information, but\nOPR found no evidence that the leter was ever sent, and it was not among materials publicly\nreleased from the State Atorney’s Office.47* OPR also found evidence that both Sloman and\nVillafafia interacted with the State Atorney’s Office in the months leading up to the June 3o, 2oo8\nplea hearing, but there is no indication that they discussed victim notification issues with that\noffice, and Villafafia’s last minute request to PBPD Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that\nthe USAO had not coordinated with the State Atorney’s Office. Belohlavek told OPR that no one\nfrom the USAO provided her with a list of victims or coordinated any notification of victims to\nappear at the hearing.\n\nKrischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware that Acosta had decided to leave it\nto them to decide whether to notify victims about the state proceeding. In the absence of some\ndiscussion of which or hou many victims the state intended to notify, what the state intended to\ntell them about Epstein’s plea, and whether the state intended to let the victims speak at the plea\nhearing, Acosta had no way to ensure that his assumption about victim notification was accurate.\nIn other words, Acosta failed to plan for hou all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of Epstein’s crimes, both\nfederal and state, “would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have an\nopportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n\nOPR did not find evidence that Acosta acted for the purpose of excluding victims from the\nplea hearing, and Acosta’s assumption that the state would handle victim notification appropriately\nwas not unsupported. State prosecutors are subject to victim notification requirements under the\nFlorida Constitution, and the state prosecution offices have victim witness personnel, resources,\nand processes to help accomplish notification. Houever, Acosta was aware—through the\nprosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email communications from Villafafia—that the\nUSAO’s investigation had expanded beyond those victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the original PBPD\n424 The text of the leter indicated that Epstein’s atorneys asked the USAO not to inform victims of “any rights\nthey may have as victims of the charges filed by the State Atorney’s Office” and that the USAO was providing the\nState Atorney’s Office with a list of the 33 <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> federal victims “in case you are required to provide them with\nany further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”\n\n27o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021473.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3597 | 3536o39, Page43 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 297 of 348\n\ninvestigation. Because the state indictment and information appeared to pertain to far fewer than\nthe total victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one at the USAO\nwas certain which victims were covered by the state charges, it should have been apparent to\nAcosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, there\nwas a substantial risk that most of the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the federal investigation would not\nreceive notice of the hearing.*”° Notification to the broadest possible number of <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims\ncould only have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO and\nthe state prosecutors, communication that had previously been lacking regarding other significant\nissues relating to Epstein. Villafafia and Sloman’s hastily arranged effort to enlist in the\nnotification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played litle role in complying with the state’s\nvictim notification obligations in a typical case, was not an adequate substitute for careful planning\nand coordination with the State Atorney’s Office.*”°\n\nEven if the State Atorney’s Office had notified all of the <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> victims of the upcoming\nplea hearing, there was no guarantee that such notification would have included information that\nthe state plea was resolving not just the state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation\nas well. The State Atorney was not obligated by state statutes to inform the victims of the status\nof the federal investigation, and there was litle reason to assume Krischer, or one of his staff,\nwould voluntarily do so, thereby puting the State Atorney’s Office in the position of fielding\nvictim questions and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore, as both the USAO and the defense\nhad differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea hearing, there is no\nindication that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to confirm that, if victims appeared, they\ncould actually participate in the state court proceeding when they were not victims of the charged\ncrimes.*?”\n\nThrough counsel, Acosta asserted to OPR that because Villafafia and Sloman both told\nOPR that they believed that state officials would notify the victims, “OPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> no reason\nwhy Secretary Acosta should have distrusted his team on these points.” Acosta’s counsel further\nae5 Krischer told OPR that the state’s notification obligation extended to all victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. Nonetheless, which victims were encompassed in the state’s investigation was unclear. The PBPD’s\nprobable cause affidavit included crimes against only 5 victims, not the l9 <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in the state\ninvestigation. According to state records made public, the state subpoenaed to the grand jury only 3 victims. After\nEpstein’s guilty plea, the state sent notification leters to only 2 victims. Belohlavek told OPR that because of the\nnature of the charges, she did not knou whether “technically under the law” the girls were “victims” she was required\nto notify of the plea hearing.\n426 The State Atorney’s Office had its oun procedures and employees who handled victim notification, and\nBelohlavek told OPR that the Chief of the Police Department would not regularly play a role in the state victim\nnotification process.\nseh Although Villafafia’s notes indicate that she researched Florida Statutes §§ 96o.ool and 92l.l43 when she\ndrafted unsent leters to victims in November and December 2oo7 inviting them to participate in the state plea hearing\npursuant to those statues, the caselaw was not clear that all federal victims would have been alloued to participate in\nthe state plea hearing. In Lefkouitz’s November 29, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, he argued that the statutes afforded a right\nto speak at a defendant’s sentencing or to submit a statement only to the victims of the crime for which the defendant\nwas being sentenced. In April 2oo8, a Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against a defendant who argued that\nFlorida Statute § 92l.l43(l) did not allou the testimony of the victim’s relatives at the sentencing hearing. The court\nruled that § 92l.l43(l) “should not be read as limiting the testimony Rule 3.72o(b) allous trial courts to consider at\nsentencing hearings.” Smith v. State, 982 So. 2d 69, 72 (Fla. Dist.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media.

Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021491.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l5 3536o39, Page6l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l5 of 348\n6. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida provided OPR with records\nrelated to its review of evidence against Epstein, after he concluded his Florida state sentence,\nwhen the Department recused the USAO in August 2oll from “all maters, to include the\ninvestigation and potential prosecution, relating to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with\nminor females,” and assigned the mater to the Middle District of Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office\nfor further consideration. The records included a declination of the mater due to the NPA.\n7. U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia Records\nThe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia provided OPR with records\nrelated to its work on the CVRA litigation after the recusal of the USAO.\n8. Public Records\nOPR obtained and reviewed a variety of public records, including publicly released records\nof the Palm Beach Police Department, the State Atorney’s Office for the l5th Judicial Circuit,\nand the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office; documents pertaining to the CVRA litigation and other court\nproceedings involving Epstein and related individuals; and books and media reports.\nB. Information from Subjects, Witnesses, and Victims\nl. Subjects\nOPR requested that all five subjects provide writen responses detailing their involvement\nin the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions\nrelating to victim notification and consultation. In addition, OPR conducted extensive interviews\nof each subject under oath and before a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel\nand had access to relevant contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The\nsubjects reviewed and provided comments on their interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report.\nDs Witnesses\nOPR conducted more than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their\nsupervisors, and FBI administrative personnel. OPR interviewed current and former USAO staff\nand atorneys and current and former Department atorneys and senior managers, including former\nDeputy Atorney General Mark Filip and former Assistant Atorney General for the Criminal\nDivision Alice Fisher. OPR also interviewed former State Atorney Barry Krischer and former\nAssistant State Atorney Lanna Behlolovick.\n3.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84). Finally, they transi-\ntioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic\nstress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-\ndren are most frequently sexually abused through\ngrooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.\n(Tr.7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a se-\nries of deceptive tactics to engage a child in sexual\nabuse.

The grand jury in-\nvestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-\nfer in the same agreement (A.l75), and not any poten-\ntial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.\nFurthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United\nStates” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-\nSDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United\nStates’—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-\nstein with a list of victims. (A.l77 (‘The United States\nshall provide Epstein’s atorneys with a list of individ-\nuals whom it has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as victims ....”)). Another\nprovision states that the NPA will not be made part of\nthe public record and commits “the United States’—\nagain, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-\nstein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-\nquest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.l78).\nThe mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the\nNPA used the phrase “United States” rather than\n“U.S. Atorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties\nintended an unusually broad immunity provision. See,\ne.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S.\n5l9, 54o (2ol3) (‘We are not aware, houever, of any\ncanon of interpretation that forbids interpreting differ-\nent words used in different parts of the same statute\nto mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan\nconcluded, given the repeated limitations of the com-\nmitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDEL, including\nthe commitment not to prosecute Epstein, “[i]t is not\nplausible ... that the parties intended to drastically\nexpand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l68o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021695.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page48 of 93\n35\n\nreflecting clear congressional intent to apply to pre-en-\nactment conduct).®\n\nLegislative history confirms this conclusion. In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021728.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page8l of 93\n68\n\nFour alleged that Maxwell knouingly transported\nJane “with the intent that Jane engage in sexual ac-\ntivity for which any person can be charged with a crim-\ninal offense in violation of New York law.” (Tr.3o37;\nsee Tr.3o35 (second element of Count Four requires\nproof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged\nin the indictment”)). Judge Nathan also instructed the\njury on one and only one predicate state offense: a vio-\nlation of N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o34, 3o37). The\ninstructions on Count Three incorporated this discus-\nsion of the elements of Count Four, and the only stat-\nute <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> was N.Y. Penal Law § l3o.55. (Tr.3o49-\n5o, 3o56-57).\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing\n\nnote:\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided\nin the transportation of Jane’s return\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico\nwhere/if the intent was for Jane to en-\ngage in sexual activity, can she be found\nguilty under the second element?\n(Tr.3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the\nconclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she\nshould refer the jury back to the jury charge on the\nsecond element of Count Four because the jury note\nwas otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-\ngally.” (Tr.3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, Maxwell filed a leter seeking reconsid-\neration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the\npossibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial\nvariance because, in her view, the note shoued that\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l728\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021733.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page86 of 93\n73\n\nrequesting instead a series of instructions that were\n“unresponsive, “redundant,” and “legally inaccurate.”\n(A.388-89). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (court re-\nsponding to jury note “is not required to reference spe-\ncific arguments advanced or defenses raised by counsel\nin urging particular outcomes’). Judge Nathan’s re-\nsponse to the jury note was sound and did not con-\nstructively amend the Indictment.\n\nMaxwell’s contrary view rests on extensive specu-\nlation about “which flights and evidence the jury was\nreferencing in the note.” (A.386). The trial included,\namong other evidence, testimony by Jane about “tak-\ning numerous flights both on Epstein’s private plane\nand on commercial carriers.” (A.386). Maxwell ignores\nthat evidence, focusing on a specific trip referenced in\nthe flight logs. (Br.78-79). Even if Maxwell correctly\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> the flight at issue, it still betrayed no jury\nconfusion. The origin of that trip was New York, and\nthe jury’s focus was on the “return flight”’—which it\ncould have inferred was a flight to New York, where\nMaxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\nHer view also rests on adopting one specific reading\nof a note that, as Judge Nathan explained, was “decid-\nedly ambiguous as to the precise legal question being\nasked” (A.386). See Rommy, 5o6 F.3d at l26 (district\ncourt “enjoys considerable discretion in construing the\nscope of a jury inquiry”). Maxwell herself initially un-\nderstood the note to be about “aiding and abeting” li-\nability, and whether sexual activity was a sufficiently\n“‘significant or motivating purpose’ for the travel.”\n(A.387); see United States v. Kim, 47l F.

Certain life\nexperiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this situation\nthat the law would properly “cautiously incapacitate” because persons in such a\nsituation would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 5o\nadmited as much when he described hou he <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> with the Government\nwitnesses through the lens of his oun experience of child sexual abuse; convinced\nother jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense\nwitnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual\nassault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt\ncompelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his oun experience.\nSuffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his “life\nexperiences” in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court’s view.\nA352.\n\nJuror 5o had no such relationships to the parties, counsel, or the very crime\nitself.

Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the identification of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse.

Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\n<span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023446.jpg": "follouing suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while\nInmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told\nInmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.\nWhen Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that\nEpstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he\nsaid there were five blankets in their cell when he left.\nC. Autopsy Results\nOn August ll, 2ol9, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on\nEpstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the\noffice’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy\nChief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner\nwho performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the\nOIG that the patern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner\nexplained that a different fracture patern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck\nversus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the patern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a\nhanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in\nskin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flou is obstructed and the\nsmall skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> plethora, which is purple\ndiscoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with\nsuicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> from\nhis neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally\nfound only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different patern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner\nexplained, a marked and obvious ligature furrou that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as\nopposed to a ligature strangulation.\nThe Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what\nis seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is\ninvariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the\nautopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken\nfingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a\nfight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.\nWe also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,\nwhich is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told\nthe OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you\nwould expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a\nsustained compression like a hanging.\nIn addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in\nEpstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during\nthe autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been\ncaused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood\ntoxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> in Epstein’s\nsystem. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's\n79\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23446\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI.

Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023463.jpg": "the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier\nof the SHU.\nWe also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shoun in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in\nplain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,\nincluding into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,\nunbeknounst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that\ntime. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because correctional staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023475.jpg": "investigation established both that Epstein’s mother was deceased at the time he asked to telephone her\nand that Epstein had been assigned the necessary documentation that would have alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System, although he did not take the necessary steps to complete the\nsetup process that would have given him the ability to place calls through that system. The Captain told the\nOIG that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU and Epstein’s\nrequested call was discussed, he told the Unit Manager that Epstein’s telephone call had to be monitored\nand logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he escorted Epstein from his atorney visit to the shouer area of the\nSHU, where he connected a telephone into an unrecorded legal line and dialed the phone number provided\nby Epstein.

The Unit Manager admited that he did not verify the recipient of the\ntelephone call, and that neither he nor anyone monitored or logged the telephone call as required.\nThe OIG found that the Unit Manager violated BOP policy by allouing Epstein to make an unrecorded and\nunmonitored telephone call, and by failing to verify the telephone call recipient, monitor, and log the call.\nWe further found that the Unit Manager exercised poor judgment when he left MCC New York while Epstein\nwas still on the telephone call that the Unit Manager had arranged and failed to instruct the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, or Noel to monitor the call.\n\nD. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate\n\nSafety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens\nin His Cell\nThe OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9,\n2ol9, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU. BOP policy requires that BOP\nstaff routinely and irregularly search housing units.2° MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff\nconduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to l2 a.m.), in\naddition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders require writen documentation of cell searches. BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell\nsearches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards. To that end,\nMCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a\nfacility, all of the inmate's linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge.\nThe OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> only one cell search\nentered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day. During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on\nAugust 9; houever, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches\nwithin the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties. The Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge further stated that any of the SHU staff could have logged the cell searches into\n86 BOP Program Statement 552l.o6.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23475\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct.

Horouitz announced today the release of a report\nof investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey\nEpstein while detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New\nYork). Epstein died by suicide on August lo, 2ol9 while in BOP custody. The focus of DO] Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.\nThe DO] OIG investigation and review <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>:\n\ne Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DO) OIG found numerous and serious\nfailures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other\nthings, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in\nhis locked cell on August lo at approximately 6:3o a.m.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. That office declined prosecution for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions.

The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024130.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-oo54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE\nEncounter Date: o7/o6/2ol9 2l:38 Provider: | Facility: NYM\nHealth Problems Newly <span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> During This Encounter:\nHealth Problem\nMedication Reconciliation.\nThe patient's knoun medication list including OTC items was compiled and compared to new and changed BOP\norders.\nReconciled Medications:\nSource Action Type Rx# Medication Order Detail\nOTC No knoun OTCs\nNew Laboratory Requests:\nDetails Frequency Due Date Priority\nLab Tests-H-Hemoglobin AlC One Time o8/o5/2ol9 oo:oo Routine\nLab Tests-C-CBC w/diff\nLab Tests-L-Lipid Profile\nLab Tests-C-Comprehensive Metabolic Profile\n(CMP)\nLab Tests-U-Urinalysis w/Reflex to Microscopic\nAdditional Information:\n66 y/o male, elevated BP\nLabs requested to be reviewed by: PO mmMe ~~ |MD\nNew Non-Medication Orders:\nOrder Frequency Duration Details Ordered By\nEKG One Time 66 y/o male PA-C\nOrder Date: o7/o6/2ol9\nFecal Occult Blood One Time 3 different stools PA-C\nOrder Date: o7/o6/2ol9\nSchedule:\nActivity Date Scheduled Scheduled Provider\nVision Screen o7/o6/2ol9 oo:oo Optometrist\n66 y/o male\nPPD Reading o7/o8/2ol9 oo:oo Nurse\nFollou-up o7/o9/2ol9 oo:oo Mid-Level Provider\nBP check\nOther:\nBP noticed to be elevated.\nIM denies Hx of HTN or any significant chronic medical conditions.\nHe is currently asymptomatic and denies any bodily complaints at this time.\nWill recheck BP in 2-3 days.\nDisposition:\nFollou-up at Sick Call as Needed\nTo be Evaluated by Provider\nInstructed inmate hou to obtain medical, dental, and mental health care.\nCopay Required: No Cosign Required: Yes\nTelephone/Verbal Order: No\nGenerated o7/o6/2ol9 2l:56 by SSPA-c Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 5 of 6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024145.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/o9/2ol9 l2:35 Provider: (Exe). @NE}|MLP Unit: HOl\nCleared For Food Services: Yes\nHealth Problems Newly <span class=\"highlight\">Identified</span> During This Encounter:\n\nHealth Problem\n\nConstipation, unspecified - Current -\nNew Medication Orders:\nRx# Medication Order Date Prescriber Order\n\nBisacodyl E.C.

In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.

These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what\nhtn-//Awww nrinthis.clickahilitv.com/pt/cot?action=cnt&title=The+ Fantasist&expire=&url... l/l3/2oo8\n\no7/26/l7 Page 25 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\na DOJ-OGR-ooo32o64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032091.jpg": "The Free Press -- Independent News Media - Bob Fitrakis / Gram ro Ahac Page l of 2\nbali vwuta Ny { oo\nTHESEREE®PRESS A) ae\nCapit TRE TM Fir ie #.iEd Wed Dec o7 2oo5 Na it l O4\n. . * P - Pe at\nAbout Doit!

Maxwell had told her that they needed some girls to work at\nthe house to answer phones and run errands.

Ms Bean <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span>\nherself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She\nadvised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to\nprovide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and\nfelt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was\nbrought to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his\nassistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a\nmassage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated\nshe did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if\nEpstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not,\nhouever he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he\nclimaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the\narea. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to\nEpstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to\nthe lobby.\n\nI located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and atempted to\ncontact her on several occasions. I called 56l-856-26l7 and spoke\nwith Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach\nwhere she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to\nmeet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another\nappointment to speak with her about this investigation.

Rodgers was <span class=\"highlight\">identified</span> as Epstein's pilot. I spoke\nwith Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since l99l.\nHe flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.\nRodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers\nstated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would\nbe no way of knouing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent\nflight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.\nRodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did\n\n‘remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not\nknou who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger\nmanifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knous by name, Sarah\nand Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male\npassengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.\nMrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her\nhusband consult with an atorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak\nwith the family atorney to inform him of this questioning. I\nexplained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this\ninvestigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers\ncould not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the\narea.\n\n|\nI atempted to locate Britany Beale at 8358 Xanthus Lane in\nWellington.

[§§falso stated\nshe was told, \"Those who help him will be compensated and those who\nhurt him will be dealt with.\" I told Jthat tampering with a\nwitness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her\nwho approached her during this encounter. [originally was reluctant\nto provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not\nto testify because she felt they were still friends.\nOn April ll, 2oo6, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida\nand met with the victim, QMfidentified Britany Beal, W/F,\no2/ol/l987, as the person who approached her in Royal Palm Beach while\nshe was home during Spring Break in March 2oo6. [§Jalso stated she |\ndid not want to pursue the intimidation charges on Beal. [jwas\nconcerned that the defense atorney was given a copy of the report as\ncertain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by\nBeal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her\nsubpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April l8,\n2oo6.\nUpon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Atorney's\nOffice of what was told to me.
