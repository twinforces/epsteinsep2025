The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003626.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 3o\nPlains community <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span> for African Americans increased from l.25% to 3.69% and for\nHispanics increased from l.l5% to 3.64%.\n\nll. Mr. Martin also compared the qualified jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan community and for the overall Southern District community. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains community, not the\nManhatan or Southern District community. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\ncommunity. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains community, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this declaration.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of Qualified Jury Wheel Selection Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the qualified jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 3o\nselected and those selected are sent a questionnaire to determine if they are qualified. The names\nof persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as a juror,\nunless granted an exception from jury service, are then placed on the qualified jury wheel from\nwhich potential jurors are summoned.\n\n23. What in this process could cause the difference in the percent African American and\npercent Hispanic between the <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span> and the qualified jury wheel? Belou is a list of all\nlikely possible causes of such a difference. In considering the differences, I view the process as\nmoving sequentially from the voter registration lists to the qualified jury wheel, and I compare\nthe absolute disparity in the percent African American and Hispanic at each step with that of the\ncommunity.\n\n24. Reasons l-3 focus on the causes of the differences between a master jury wheel that\nis drawn from the voter registration list such that every registered voter in White Plains as of\nNovember l, 2ol6 had an equal likelihood of being included, and the community. Reasons 4-5\nfocus on the causes of the differences between the actual master jury wheel and such a randomly\ndrawn master jury wheel. Reasons 6-8 focus on the causes of the differences between the\nqualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\nReasons:\n\nCommunity vs Randomly Selected Master Jury Wheel from Voter Registration Lists\n\nl) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because U.S.\n\ncitizens of voting age (i.e., the community) and those registered to vote (i.e., the master\n\njury wheel) are different.\n\n2) The estimate of the demographics of the community may differ from the demographics of\n\nthose on the voter registration lists because the estimates are from different times and also\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 3o\npercentage points less African American than the estimated percent in the community and l.l5\npercentage points less Hispanic than the estimated percent in the community.\n\n29. While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,\nthey are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter\nregistration lists and the community could be caused by reason l| and/or by reason 2 or by reason\n3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury\nwheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4\nand/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel\nand voter lists may occur.\n\n3o. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and\nthe voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting\nfrom the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of\nthe disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the\nvoter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly\nlikely that chance variation would only result in at most a o.ool difference between the master\njury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the\ndifference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists\nmust be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the\ncommunity (reasons l and 2). As shoun herein, the voter registration lists are a good source\nfrom which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nfrom the voter registration lists is only o.57% for African Americans and o.33% for Hispanics.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the questionnaire,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury\nwheel (reason 7). As a result of this, the percent of African Americans on the qualified jury\nwheel is 2.58 percentage points louer and the percent of Hispanics is 2.59 percentage points\nlouer. This accounts for all of the absolute difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nmaster jury wheel and 69.9% of the absolute difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity for African Americans and 7l.2% for Hispanics.\n\n38.

While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter population—and the <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span> for the\ncommunity—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span> computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\ncommunity <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span>. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the <span class=\"highlight\">benchmark</span> based on the community demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8.

Mr. Martin’s presentation, unlike my analysis, never does this. Instead, he\ncherry picks issues which might impact the absolute disparity, but never measures the extent to\nwhich it does, or he simply cherry picks persons who are in the community currently but not in\nNovember l, 2ol6, without any atempt to update the community benchmarks.\n\nas ’\n[pe\nBernardR.
