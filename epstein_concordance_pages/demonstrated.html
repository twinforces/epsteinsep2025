(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000339.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page ll of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\ninternational travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance.

In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000987.jpg": "Cased 2o-€f Qo36Go4AUt DibeutreOtl 22o 2Ft il e@ OFAL8) 26a geadgec’ 2Ho9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding.

And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo987", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000988.jpg": "Cessd 2o-€f Qo36o4AUt Bibeu tet 22o 2Ft il e@ OF ALG) 26a Geadgect 2oo9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001155.jpg": "CaSede2ot er OD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a ded deci 3 Ob 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll55", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001157.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8)26adedGecl 5 Ob 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001170.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGeck 8 Ob 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span>\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001172.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNt n DeGMeHolooo AFiled 425o8)26 a Raigec8o Gb 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001174.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagecs A Ob 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001179.jpg": "CaSesk2Zo-ef (ooS 2os AdTen (Dec ante) l6o2l, RRB 52ol d729 e Rage l66f 2\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\n— FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell.

She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001228.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Deke Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a geageol J G6 22\n\nNone of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool228", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001303.jpg": "Cass4 :27-C€r-O2o48uMenIDichmehO3O@ 2File@ O2Io6/Alagedge HB l4l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial.

The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than\nAdequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the\ncircumstances created by the COVID-l9 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk\nand prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government\nhas not carried its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42. We respectfully submit that the proposed\nbail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B).\n\nThe package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and\nfriends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her\ndespite the unrelenting media atacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered\nas aresult of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an\nextremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is\nalso to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.\n\nThe package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering\nall passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern\nDistricts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,\nfor personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.\nUnder the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial\nServices.'®\n\"© In United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2ol9), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under\nwhich a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed\nsecurity guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant\n“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” Jd. (emphasis in original). We submit\nthat a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United\nStates, and a <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did\n\n2o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001613.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 3 of l9\ndomestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly\ndeclines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears\nto be skilled at living in hiding. These are glaring red flags, even before the Court considers the\ngravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if convicted at trial.\n\nInstead of atempting to address the risks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to\nextraordinary financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in\nFrance, and who has already <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendant\ninstead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than an unsecured bond. Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknoun number of whom\neven reside in the United States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and the\nGovernment have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to\nable to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the\nco-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so.\nThe defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of\nNew York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001614.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page 4 of l9\n\nFinally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-l9 pandemic is — and should be — a\nrelevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. Houever, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)\nis taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason\nwhy she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical\nconditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their oun\ndefense, especially long before trial, through established policies and procedures applicable to\nevery pretrial detainee.

Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably\nassure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\nweigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely\nnothing to mitigate those risks.\n\nI.

Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 54 Filed o9/o8/2o Page 6 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Indeed, given that crime victims have a statutory right to be present and heard at any\nproceeding regarding the defendant’s “release,” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4), the Government would\nobject to any proceeding addressing aspects of a renewed bail application that was conducted\nentirely in camera.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nBy: __s/\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool846", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 36 of 9l 36\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl the defendant's <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> willingness and ability to live in\n2 hiding, her ability to live comfortably beyond the reach of\n\ni) extradition, her strong interactional ties and lack of\n\n4 community ties, significant and unexplained wealth, and the\n\n5 presumption of detention in light of very serious charges -- in\n6 light of all that, your Honor, it is extremely surprising that\n7 the defendant would propose a bail package with virtually no\n\n8 security whatsoever.\n\n9 In addition to failing to describe in any way the\n\nlo absence of proposed cosigners of a bond, the defendant also\n\nll makes no mention whatsoever about the financial circumstances\nl2 or assets of her spouse whose her identity she declined to\n\nl3 provide to Pretrial Services.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l3 of 36\nFurther, and as set forth belou, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,\nincluding contemporary documents and other witnesses.\n\nIn challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.\nAt the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested\nheavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 3o-\n33).\n\nNone of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l5 of 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 28 of 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span>\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3o of 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States).

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine\nMaxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure\nthat she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she\nexploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her\nposition of pouer to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would\nfit with her long history of anti-social behavior.\n\nDrawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of hou she has\nlived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children\nand young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.\nShe was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with\nwhat many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including\nrepeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle\nrelying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.\n\nMaxwell has repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that her primary concern is her oun welfare, and\nthat she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse PO\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24).

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“Te]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4—88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(@), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo225l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002374.jpg": "GeaSell2 sce MOFABARW SP OOURIRRERBE2] FilKedORzOHS!

Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation.

His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of 38\nthe NPA clearly intended to confer a benefit on any and all of Epstein’s potential co-conspirators\nin explicitly giving them immunity. Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was intentional, as <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 24 of 38\noffenses at issue will be “instituted in this District.” NPA at 2 (emphases added). In addition,\nthe use of the term “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity provision contrasts with\nthe use elsewhere in the agreement of various terms that refer more specifically to the USAO-\nSDFL. When the government wanted a provision of the NPA to refer only to the USAO-SDFL,\nit knew hou to do so; where it chose not to do so, a different intent is <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span>.\n\nIndeed, the omission of express language limiting the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL was contrary to Justice Department policy. The Justice Manual (formerly the U.S.\nAtorneys’ Manual) expressly provides, and provided at the time the NPA was executed, that “if\npracticable, the atorney for the government should explicitly limit the scope of his/her [non-\nprosecution] agreement to non-prosecution within his/her district.” Justice Manual, Comment to\n§ 9-27.63o. The government’s deviation from a policy of which it was obviously aware—for\noffenses that, by their nature, involve interstate travel and are susceptible to prosecution in\nmultiple districts—cannot be regarded as an oversight, particularly where the policy was\nfolloued elsewhere in the NPA with respect to the immunity provision as to Epstein.\n\nDe United States v. Annabi does not alter the analysis.\n\nIn support of its position, the government has cited United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o\n(2d Cir. l985). Reply Mem. at 5. But Annabi does not support the government’s position. In\nfact, to the extent it is relevant here, it supports dismissal.\n\nIn Annabi, the government, follouing a guilty plea to one count of a three-count\nindictment in the Eastern District of New York, agreed to move to dismiss the two open counts.\nUnlike here, there was no writen agreement; rather, the prosecutor stated on the record at the\ntime of the plea that “the only agreement that exists between the defendants and the Government\nis that at the time of the imposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts as to each defendant.” 77l F.2d at 67l.

Given that three circuits have held otherwise—and that one of them has\naddressed the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Annabi in detail—it is likely that the Eleventh\nCircuit would follou the weight of authority and hold that absent an express provision to the\ncontrary, a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement executed in the name of “the United\nStates” binds USAOs in other districts.\n\nAs previously <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span>, there is no conflict between this position and Annabi as\napplied to these facts, because Annabi supports dismissal here. But to the extent that Annabi\ncould be construed as limiting the NPA’s effect to the SDFL, it would be inconsistent with the\nEleventh Circuit’s likely disposition of the issue and should not be folloued here.\n\nWe understand that Epstein and his counsel sought to ensure, to the fullest extent\npossible, that third parties would not face criminal liability in connection with his actions, in part\nto minimize the likelihood that he would be subpoenaed as a witness. Thus, Epstein and his\ncounsel reasonably understood that, unlike Epstein’s oun immunity, the immunity for his alleged\nco-conspirators from federal prosecution would not be limited to the SDFL. To the extent that\nthe government intended to impose such a limitation, it was the obligation of the government, in\ndrafting the agreement, to ensure that such limitations were included.

His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months.

Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered disclosure of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22).

While the Government argued that the court\nneed not employ the Martindell balancing test for several reasons, it also made arguments under\nMartindell in the alternative. Ultimately, both Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Netburn found\nthat Martindell applied and analyzed the Government’s application under that framework.\n\nAs Chief Judge McMahon found, even under the Martindell approach, testimony provided\npursuant to a protective order can be divulged to a grand jury if the government establishes “some\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.

Mot. ll at l6), this case is distinguishable from\nUnited States v. Oshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). There, the defendant had already been\nindicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the\npending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the\ndeposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-7oo. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition\ntranscript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order\nwas improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,\nin view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 7ol. The court found that the protective order served\nthe “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the\ntime of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted\nthe use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the\ndeposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 7oo; see also\nBotha v.

Feb.\n27, l998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an\nindictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal\ncriminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge\nMcMahon found that the “Government has persuasively <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> extraordinary\ncircumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).\nAs she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was\ntrolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal\ninvestigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already\nconcluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.\n‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth\nAmendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.\n\nlo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\nQualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F.

It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims.

Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.

So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3353", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA.

Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual\n\nAbuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child.\n\nAs <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly\nand consistently that an “offense” or “crime” that “involves” certain conduct means an offense\nthat necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, l4o S. Ct.\n779, 782 (2o2o) (“a court should look to the state offense’s elements” rather than case-specific\nfacts); United States v. Davis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (rejecting argument that “offense\nthat .. . involves” provision permited court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to\nsave provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v.

The government’s atempt to limit this clear line of cases is\nunpersuasive.\n\nThe government claims that a “necessarily entails” approach (or, as the government\ndescribes it, a “categorical” approach) is “only used in setings like sentencing and immigration,\nwhere a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction.” Opp. 39.

The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged\n\nConspiracies Are Distinct.\n\nTo guard against the “well recognized danger” that prosecutors can easily “draft\nindictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an\noverall conspiracy,” where a defendant “makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in\nfact charge only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies.” United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (citing United States v.

The government has\nfailed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be deemed\nconfessed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, she requests that\nthe Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the conspiracy charge it intends to\nprosecute and dismiss the remaining count.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo376l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page lo of 23\ncourts hold the government to an even higher standard than parties to a commercial contract.\nFeldman, 939 F.3d at l89 (describing “meticulous standards of performance” to which\nprosecutors are held in negotiating plea agreements). As the government acknouledges, at least\nthree courts have applied the third-party beneficiary doctrine to confer standing on third parties\nto enforce immunity provisions in plea agreements. Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228; E/-\nSadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6o8-o9; United States v. CFW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. l97, 2o3\n(D.S.C. l984), aff'd, 749 F.2d 33 (4 Cir. l984). The government’s atempt to distinguish these\ncases on the ground that they did not “analyze” the applicability of the third-party beneficiary\ndoctrine to plea agreements (Opp. l9) is uterly nonsensical. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> in Ms. Maxwell’s\nopening memorandum (“Mem.”), all three courts expressly held that the doctrine applies. Mem.\nl6-l7.\n\nThe lone case cited by the government to the contrary does not suggest a different result\nhere. In United States v. Mariamma Viju (ol), the court held that a third party may not enforce\nrights under a plea agreement “[w]here the defendant himself can obtain relief” from a broken\nplea deal.” No. 3:l5-CR-o24o-B, 2ol6 WL lo784l, *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll, 2ol6). Here,\nEpstein cannot obtain relief for the government’s breach of the NPA; not only is he deceased, but\nhe served the sentence stemming from his guilty plea long before his death, paid millions of\ndollars to accusers under the NPA’s claims provision, and thus would have had no occasion to\nenforce the NPA by withdrawing his guilty plea. Nor is it clear that Epstein could have\nwithdrawn his plea had the NPA been breached while he was serving his sentence, given that the\nNPA—unlike a plea agreement—was not submited to the state court in which Epstein entered\nhis plea.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagellof23\n\nIn sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a “potential co-conspirator of\nEpstein,” and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator\nimmunity provision as a third-party beneficiary.\n\nI. The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL.\n\nMs. Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an\naffirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike\nEpstein’s immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). In\narguing that the NPA’s selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein’s immunity\napplies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and\nasks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly,\nproceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce\nevidence regarding the parties’ intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA,\nread using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the\ngovernment from prosecuting Epstein’s potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that\nthe Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the\ngovernment and Epstein’s atorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permited to obtain it\nthrough discovery.\n\nThe government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond\nthe SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), in\nwhich the Second Circuit stated that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United\nStates Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the\nagreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief\n“Contrary to the government’s suggestion, no court has held that an “affirmative[] appear[ance]” requires an explicit\n“promise to bind other districts.” See Opp. 4. Rather, in interpreting a plea agreement, “[t]he court looks to the\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3884", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document223 Filed o4/2o/2l Page l2 of 23\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that the NPA, as a whole, gives rise to such an appearance—and the government\noffers no reasonable alternative interpretation.\n\nUnlike Annabi and its progeny, the NPA here contains significant evidence of the parties’\nintent to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL. While the provision\ngranting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions “in this\nDistrict,” NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation.\n\n“TW |here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended\ndifferent meanings.” Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Mortg. Capital,\nInc., 82l F.3d 297, 3o9 (2d Cir. 2ol6); see also Collins v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac, 929 F.3d\n83o, 84l (7th Cir. 2ol9) (noting “common, if not automatic presumption” that “when parties to\nthe same contract use such different language to address parallel issues, it is reasonable to infer\nthat they intend this language to mean different things”) (internal punctuation and citation\nomited); Penncro Assocs., Inc. v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P., 499 F.3d ll5l, ll56-57 (loth Cir.\n2oo7) (same). Thus, the appropriate inference here is that the parties intended to limit Epstein’s\nimmunity, but not immunity for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (“SDFL”).\n\nThe government offers no reasonable alternative explanation for the contrasting language\nin the two provisions. Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein’s immunity to\nthe SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ immunity to the SDFL as well, but\nmust have forgoten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of\ndifferent language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different\nmeanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head. See, e.g., Bank of\nreasonable understanding of the parties as to the terms of the agreement.” United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x\n268, 27o (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal citations and emphasis omited).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3885", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys.

The Defendant Has Not <span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrated</span> Relevance and Admissibility.\n\nThe Court’s analysis does not stop at specificity—Requests l through 5 independently fail\nbecause the Defendant has not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that all of the communications she seeks are relevant\nand admissible. The Defendant’s sole basis for contending that the wide array of communications\nshe seeks are all relevant to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions\nto suppress based on misrepresentations made by the government to Chief Judge McMahon and a\nmotion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial delay” because they “would establish the\nsubstance and frequency of the communications between BSF and the government prior to the\ngovernment’s end run around Martindell.” Resp.

But the Defendant has not met her\nburden of demonstrating relevance and admissibility.\n\nFirst, because Rule l7’s “purpose is trial-focused,” a Rule l7(c) subpoena “may be used\nonly to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial.” United States v.

The Request is Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant does not even address the lack of specificity of her Request for “any\nsubmission to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims\non behalf of persons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct,\nany releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your\nClients.” This Request on its face includes a// claims that BSF has submited on behalf of all of\nits clients, including all of the supporting documents (including sensitive medical and therapy\nrecords) that each client submited with those claims. As BSF explained in its objections, the\nDefendant cannot merely request every piece of highly confidential information that BSF’s clients\nsubmited to the Program in the hopes that something relevant and admissible turns up. The\nDefendant offered to narrou this Request to EVCP Material submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action. This “narrouing” does not change the improper nature of Request\nl2—even the narrouer request would call for broad swaths of material that are both irrelevant to\nthe charges against the Defendant and that are highly sensitive in nature.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not <span class=\"highlight\">Demonstrated</span> Relevance, Other Than Potential\n\nImpeachment.\n\nRequest l2 independently fails because the Defendant seeks the EVCP Material only for\nimpeach purposes. The Defendant argues that the EVCP Material is not “mere impeachment\nmaterial” because it is also “Brady material.” Resp. Ltr. at l3. This argument does not make this\nRequest proper under Rule l7.

Other than through\nconclusory speculation, she fails to explain hou the contents of those leters may be relevant to\nher theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the\nextent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce\nthem in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is litle more than an atempt to\ncircumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not\nyet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents\nconsistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion &\nOrder resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good\nfaith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to\ncomply with them. This Court knous well that the Government has not always lived up to those\nobligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good\nfaith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum,\nnone of Maxwell’s theories justify production of these documents under the Rule l7(c) process.\n\nRequest l2, which seeks “‘any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation\nProgram made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks\n“any” submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell\noffered to narrou this request to just those materials submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action.\n\nThe request’s failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of\nspecificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this\nrequest, she plainly has not <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> the relevance of all materials submited to the EVCP.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o44", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation.

Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.”*? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\nZs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4475", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document3o7_ Filed o6/25/2l Pagel8 of 2l\nprosecutors. As the Court has explained above, this is consistent with the Second Circuit’s\nstatement that a protective order “provides no guarantee that [evidence] will not somehou find\nits way into the government’s hands for use in a subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876\nF.2d at lo83. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could only have reasonably relied\non the protective order insofar as it prohibited BSF from fomenting an investigation against her\nwith confidential documents. If Judge McMahon had knoun of the 2ol6 meeting, it is\narguable—albeit far from certain—that she might have instead concluded that BSF breached\nMaxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.\n\nBut Judge McMahon also held that the Government had shoun extraordinary\ncircumstances justifying ex parte modification of the protective order. She observed that\nmodification of the protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and that the\nGovernment had <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> good cause to obtain the sought materials through a grand jury\nsubpoena without alerting potential targets of its criminal investigation. Extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need provide a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective\norder under Martindell notwithstanding the parties’ reasonable reliance on that order. See\nMinpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. l987) (citing\nMartindell, 594 F.2d at 296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should have told Judge\nMcMahon about communications with BSF in 2ol6, and even assuming that information was\nmaterial to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge\nMcMahon would still have granted the Government’s application.

With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5.

Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

(quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 27\n.

To have refused access to these records in |\nthe face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion.” Jd. at 423. |\nI will, therefore, consider the Government’s application. |\nB. The Martindell Standard Applies |\nOrdinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |\nCourt should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |\n273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2ool). Houever, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |\nto this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). |\nMartindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |\ndistrict court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )\nsubject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |\ninvestigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |\nprotective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., lo4 |\nF.R.D. 559, 57o (E.D.N.Y. l985), aff'd, 82l F.2d l39 (2d Cir. l987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |\nat 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |\na shouing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |\ncircumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |\nupon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo883 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4933 |", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 27\n\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThis decision accords with those of other courts in this Circuit. “Where a protective |\norder contains express language that limits the time period for enforcement, anticipates the |\npotential for modification, or contains specific procedures for disclosing confidential materials to |\nnon-parties, it is not reasonable for a party to rely on an assumption that it will never be |\nmodified.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32o. More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a protective order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\nprotective order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the Protective Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\ndisclosure of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a protective order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order. In such a case, whether to lift or modify a protective |\norder is a decision commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” TheStreet.Com, 273 |\nF.3d at 23l (internal quotation omited); accord Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, |\nl42 n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“If reliance would be unreasonable, it is within the discretion of the court |\nto vacate or modify a protective order.”). |\nFor the reasons discussed belou, the Court finds that modification of the Protective Order :\nis appropriate to aid law enforcement.\nE.

See Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l48 (“exceptionally |\n|\n\npervasive protection granted appellants during the pretrial stages of this litigation, coupled with |\nthe fact that appellants never were required to shou good cause,” as well as the fact that there |\nwas “enormous public interest in the Agent Orange litigation,” <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> extraordinary |\ncircumstances); but see Ionosphere Clubs, l56 B.R. at 435 (“[M]ere breadth” of a protective |\norder does not, by itself constitute “extraordinary circumstances.”). Indeed, some district courts |\nin this Circuit go one step further, holding that “The heightened Martindell ‘extraordinary |\ncircumstances’ standard . . . is not appropriate in cases with stipulated protective orders that grant |\nparties open-ended and unilateral deference to protect whichever discovery materials they |\nchoose.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l. |\nHere, as discussed, no party was required to make a good cause shouing before |\ndesignating any particular discovery materials as confidential.

When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v.

Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law.

If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence.

Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v.

In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87).

In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006442.jpg": "minors at the time of their testimony’; and (3) alleged victims who <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> legitimate\nsafety concerns.”\n'8 Mot. at 7 United States v.

(Indictment ¥J| l3(d), l9(d)). Evidence proving overt\nacts in the Indictment is direct evidence of the offense, and not other-acts evidence. See United\nStates v. James, 52o F.

The Court previously denied the defense’s motion\nto strike the overt acts involving Minor Victim-3 as surplusage, explaining that it “may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6755", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006762.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 54 of 84\nwith Epstein. When Minor Victim-3 began having sexual contact with Epstein, she was l7. The\nissue at trial will be the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s preference for girls under the age of\nl8. Under federal law, there is a term for individuals under the age of l8: minors. There is nothing\ninappropriate about using that term at trial.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “sexual abuse” is accurate, and the Government should be permited\nto use it. Minor Victim-3 is expected to testify about her experiences with the defendant and\nEpstein, including that she was sexually abused by Epstein numerous times. Regardless of whether\nshe uses the term “sexual abuse,” her testimony will capture her experience—that she was\nexploited sexually. Andi it is fair for the Government to argue that those acts were sexual abuse.\nThe defense argues that the phrase “sexual abuse” is misleading because it suggests to the jury that\nEpstein engaged in “criminal sexual activity” with Minor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 4 at l4-l5). To\njustify that proposition, the defense cites a single Supreme Court case in which (l) the parties were\nengaged in the task of statutory interpretation, not argument in a jury address or description of a\nvictim’s lived experience, and (2) the Court rejected that proposed definition of “sexual abuse of\na minor” as “flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in th[at] very\ndictionary.” Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7). Again, the Government\nis confident that the Court will properly instruct the jury regarding the elements of the crimes in\nthe Indictment.\n\nFinally, there is no basis for an instruction about United Kingdom law. The defense has\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> no unfair prejudice that might warrant a limiting instruction, and the defense’s\nproposed instructions would only confuse the jury.

Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances.

Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v.

In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\nphenomenon they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006921.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the identification. /d. at ll86.

Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no intention of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify. As the motion makes clear, the defense fully understands the contours of lay versus\nopinion testimony from law enforcement officers.

And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are.

And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are.

Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”).

But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias.

The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5—o6 (2d Cir. l982). Actual prejudice “is commonly\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752.

The defendant’s patern of exploitative conduct, and her lies to evade responsibility\nfor her crimes, should be met with punishment that holds her accountable for the full measure of\nher criminal conduct and the abuse and horror for which she is responsible.\n\nA Guidelines sentence would also deter those who would facilitate sexual abusers in\npositions of pouer. As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

(Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case.

In other words, a defendant may be released on such a\ncondition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original).

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.).

Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

(See Dkt. l8 at l9; Tr. 64-65).\nHaving received and reviewed the discovery, the defense nou contends the Government’s\ncorroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates\ndefense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.'

Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020075.jpg": "Cageab2o-ce6oBaGAdsnt Becument loo2 Filed6R238/2thg Page tl Sts 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already recognized,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\n<span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020088.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BGHANt DEctIMe ri loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPage staf 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span>\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020090.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEciuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBOet 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\nfinancial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\nfinancial resources, but has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020092.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBtlANt BEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageB26af 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020097.jpg": "Casmi2o‘c68oB3oANeht Docume Wo2l, FIGASZ)l Bade3Bagel Hof 2\nBOIES\nSCHILLER\n— FLEXNER\nSigrid S.

I write this not only on behalf of\nmyself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell.

She is quite capable of doing so once more. She\nwill not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially\nfor her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.\nShe would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued\nimprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained.

Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the financial report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the financial condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24).

Here,\ntoo, the Court’s original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the\noriginal hearing, the Defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> an extraordinary capacity to evade detection,\n“le|ven in the face of what the Defense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to\nlocate her.” Tr. at 87:4 87:l9. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the\npress, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in\nevading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring,\nrestrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at\n87:4 88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with electronic monitoring does not\nprevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States v. Zarger, No. oo-\nCR-773-S-l (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo). Furthermore, while the\nDefendant nou represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who\nwould serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(4), and\nthat she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not\noutweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the\nDefendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future\nproceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held “does not\npermit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial\nwhile wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails.” United States v. Boustani,\n932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be\ndetained regardless of her wealth, and “if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be\ndetained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for\nprivate detention.” Jd.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol46", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020221.jpg": "CdSest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdi BA62 Filkeh62/o6/Phg Pee di3l66l6\nhopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.\n\nThis is no way to prepare for a trial.

In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020241.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page/ of 25\nAlthough the defense argued that Maxwell did not leave the United States after\nEpstein’s arrest and was in contact with the Government through counsel, Judge\nNathan emphasized that Maxwell “did not provide the government with her\nwhereabouts,” and, in any event, “the reality that Ms. Maxwell may face such serious\ncharges herself may not have set in until after she was actually indicted.” (/d. at 84-\n85).\n\nl4.

Judge Nathan’s reliance on the Government’s proffers was\nentirely proper, particularly on the facts of this case. This is not a case where the\nGovernment “simply stat[ed] in general and conclusory terms what it hoped to\nprove,” or where the Government proffered the statements of a single witness with\na history of perjury.

So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.””? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2. The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\n2oH In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l385", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA.

The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA.

But \"[w]hen a juror has\nlife experiences that correspond with evidence presented during trial, that\ncongruence raises obvious concerns about the juror's possible [implied or inferred]\nbias.\" U.S. v. Torres, l28 F.3d at 47-48; see Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d ll5o, ll58-\n59 (loth Cir. l99l). That bias went unexplored at the hearing resulting in the failure\nof the Court to take proper steps to screen the juror for bias after the verdict.\n\nA conviction will only be reversed if the District Court abused its discretion\nby incorporating an error of law, or resting its decision on a clearly erroneous factual\nfinding. Here, both the Court’s finding that Juror 5o was credible (a clearly\nerroneous factual finding), and its ruling that Juror 5o’s truthful answers during voir\ndire would not have established a valid basis for cause (an error of law), meet that\nstandard for abuse of discretion.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l766", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021779.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 94, o2/o6/2o24, 36o84l9, Page‘ of 2\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nDEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON CATHERINE O'HAGAN WOLFE\nCHIEF JUDGE CLERK OF COURT\nDate: February o6, 2o24 DC Docket #: l:2o-cr-33o-l\nDocket #: 22-l426cr DC Court: SDNY (NEW YORK\nShort Title: United States of America v.

But because\nthey were able to convince members of our office that it was\nsomehou extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became\nwho was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And\nbecause of that, the legal prouess, if you will, of the atorneys [ ]\n[became] something to consider.\n\nI think that the ability of Alan Dershouitz and Ken Starr and Jay\nLefkouitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t knou what I was\ntalking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a\nnumber of factors and it all came together.\n\nAlthough Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she\nconceded that the defense team’s tactics <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout\nthe case, Epstein’s atorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing\nnuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,\nand the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to\ncarefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.\n\nThere is litle question that Epstein’s extensive team of atorneys was able to obtain\nnegotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core\nrequirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein\ncertain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,\nexperienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with\natorneys who knew hou to obtain Department review of a USAO mater, thereby delaying\nundesired outcomes for as long as possible.*”? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, houever, OPR\ndid not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’\nrelationships with the atorneys he had selected to represent him.\n\n2s The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel\nDid Not Influence Their Actions\n\nAcosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did\nnot affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former\ncolleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were\nuseful because they afforded a defense atorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a\nprosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense atorney to “tailor”\narguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told\nOPR, houever, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he\n“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting\n223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many\nmillion dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”\n\nl5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects interaction.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.jpg": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.jpg": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also <span class=\"highlight\">demonstrated</span> a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023758.jpg": "requesting atorney with the proper inmate consent.
