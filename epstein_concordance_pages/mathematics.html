JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media.

While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man. To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. .\n\nPersonal History\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\nfrom which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033222.jpg": "Around l974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching\nposition in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> with an annual salary of $l2,ooo at the Dalton School, a highly\nrespected private school in uptoun Manhatan which caters to the wealthy. Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &\n\nCompany (nou Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the\n\n“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on\n\ninvestment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the\n\n2\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033226.jpg": "When it became clear, houever, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not\ninclude staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no\nfuture as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three\nchildren. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly\nevery day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so\nin the 26 years they have knoun each other. She described their current relationship as\nfollous:\n\nToday [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is\nthe godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as\nwell. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the\nevening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and\nconduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the\nchildren’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational\ngames for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey\nwas extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could\nnot ask for a beter friend or godfather to my children.\n. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, l2. Celina wrote\nglouingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time\n: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science\nand <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for\nexample, as why the sky is blue or hou fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they\nthen spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing\nvoice (even though, as she knous, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this\narea). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, houever, by an\nincident Celina related in her leter:\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2\nyears ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter\ndance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I\ndidn’t knou what I would do because you had to bring your father to the\ndance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone\ncall to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than lo\nminutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he\nrushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.\n\nAfter Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey\nentered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning\n6\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033230.jpg": "in 2oo5 recognized Jeffrey’s generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to atend\nthe school who otherwise would not have been able to.\n\nPerhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey’s philanthropy is his no-strings atached\nsupport of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting “bleeding edge” research.\nAs previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> and science,\nand is particularly atracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of\nlife. By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.” He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033221.tif": "JEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nJeffrey Epstein is a person who, having been raised in modest, louer iniddle\nclass circumstances in New York City, parlayed an aptitude for <span class=\"highlight\">Mathematics</span>, a\nteaching experience in a private school, and a chance referral to a Wall Street\nexecutive into a unique, niche business to the wealthy which in turn has made him a\nwealthy person. While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is\nhardly the measure of the man, To those who have knoun him long or intimately, he is\na loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the\nscientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his\nlargesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most\nimportantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary\ncitizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding\n\nperson, mentor, and friend. :\n\nPersonal History ,\nJeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in\n. l953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was\nraised in modest louer middle class circumstances in a longstanding Jewish\n: neighborhood. Jeffrey’s father supported the family as a laborer for the New York City\nParks Department. Jeffrey’s mother was a housewife until Jeffrey and his brother were in\nhigh school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:\nhis youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment\n. from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a\n' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.\n\nJeffrey atended public schools where his aptitude in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> became evident\nearly on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. l88 and was subsequently placed in a special\nprogram which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High\nSchool. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayete High\nSchool in l969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey\natended Cooper Union in Manhatan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.\nJeffrey dropped out of Cooper Union and took independent courses at New York\nUniversity. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for\nspending money.\n\nl .\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033222.tif": "Around l974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching\nposition in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> with an annual salary of $l2,ooo at the Dalton School, a highly\nrespected private school in uptoun Manhatan which caters to the wealthy. Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &\n\nCompany (nou Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the\n\n“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on\n\ninvestment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the\n\n2\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033226.tif": "When it became clear, houever, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not\ninclude staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no\nfuture as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three\nchildren. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly\nevery day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so\nin the 26 years they have knoun each other. She described their current relationship as\nfollous:\n\nToday [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is\nthe godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as\nwell. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the\nevening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and\nconduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the\nchildren’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational\ngames for the Kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey\nwas extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could\nnot ask for a beter friend or godfather to my children.\n. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, l2. Celina wrote\nglouingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time\n: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science\nand <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for\nexample, as why the sky is blue or hou fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they\nthen spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing\nvoice (even though, as she knous, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this\narea). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, houever, by an\nincident Celina related in her leter:\nOne of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2\nyears ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter\ndance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I\ndidn’t knou what I would do because you had to bring your father to the\ndance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone\ncall to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than lo\nminutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he\nrushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.\n\nAfter Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey\nentered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning\n6\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33226", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033230.tif": "in 2oo5 recognized Jeffrey’s generosity in assisting 27 students from 24 families to atend\nthe school who otherwise would not have been able to.\n\nPerhaps the most unique area of Jeffrey’s philanthropy is his no-strings atached\nsupport of scientists and mathematicians who are conducting “bleeding edge” research.\nAs previously noted, Jeffrey has always had a deep interest in <span class=\"highlight\">mathematics</span> and science,\nand is particularly atracted to research which focuses on the mathematical foundation of\nlife. By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3.
