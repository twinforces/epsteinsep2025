The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation.

Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue.

But even the government concedes that, at best, | ti—‘sSCsdY\neC‘\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these three witnesses.” Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F.

The\ngovernment knous that it “is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,”\nUnited States v. Upton, 856 F.

Mendez v. Artuz,\n3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s ex parte\nsubmission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by\nthe prosecution at trial — that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\n\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed “impeachment only” they would remain\ndiscoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government’s proof\ndepends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, “impeachment”\nevidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of\nNew York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation.

Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at\n7-lo). Among the factors weighing against bringing charges were that (l) Ms. Constand had\nwaited a year to file her complaint, which diminished the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Ms. Constand’s\nrecollections; (i) Ms. Constand’s statements about the events were inconsistent; (il) there was a\nlack of corroborating evidence; (iv) Ms. Constand continued to speak to and meet with Mr. Cosby\n! The opinion (“Op.”) is atached to this leter as Exhibit A.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion. Cosby admited that he told Constand and her\nmother that he would write doun the name of the pills and provide them that information,\nbut he acknouledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being\nasked to do so—Cosby provided the police with pills, which laboratory testing confirmed\nto be Benadryl.\n\nIn February 2oo5, then-District Atorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews\nand Cosby’s writen answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.\nThe fact that Constand had failed to promptly file a complaint against Cosby troubled the\ndistrict atorney. In D.A. Castor’s view, such a delay diminished the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of any\nrecollections and undermined the investigators’ efforts to collect forensic evidence.\nMoreover, D.A. Castor identified a number of inconsistences in Constand’s various\nstatements to investigators. After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 69\nB. Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. Applicable Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2. Discussion\nHere, the NPA, the government’s prior charging decisions, and the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein are all relevant and admissible to allou Ms. Maxwell to challenge the “thoroughness”\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 5o of 69\nno authority indicating that more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “motivated by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the government’s investigation. Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46; Bouen, 799 F.2d at\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005579.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 4o\npermit this. As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 4o\nparticular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo558l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005633.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page9of24\nv.

If an expert’s opinions rest “on data,\na methodology, or studies that are simply inadequate to support the conclusions reached,\nDaubert and Rule 7o2 mandate the exclusion of that unreliable opinion testimony.” Amorgianos,\n3o3 F.3d at 266.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Daubert set forth several factors for the court to consider in\ndetermining <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>: “(l) whether a theory or technique can be (and has been) tested; (2)\nwhether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) a\ntechnique’s knoun or potential rate of error, and the existence and maintenance of standards\ncontrolling the technique’s operation; and (4) whether a particular technique or theory has gained\n‘general acceptance’ in the relevant scientific community” Amorgianos, 3o3 F.3d at 266 (cleaned\nup). “Rule [7o2] applies its <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> standard to all ‘scientific,’ ‘technical,’ or ‘other\nspecialized’ maters within its scope.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at l47-48.\n\nAssuming an expert’s opinions clear the relevancy and <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> hurdles of Daubert and\nRule 7o2, the court must nevertheless exclude the evidence if it violates Rule 7o4, Rule 4o3, or\nRule 4o4.

But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F. Supp. 2d 45o, 53o (S.D.N.Y. 2ool).* An expert relies “solely or\nprimarily on experience, the witness must explain hou that experience leads to the conclusion\nreached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and hou that experience is\nreliably applied to the facts.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee’s Note to the 2ooo\nAmendments. Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients. Rocchio simply assumes her patients are telling the truth when they claim they were\nabused. This assumption fatally undermines the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinion because “[t]here is also\nno knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is there a reliable method or a\nseries of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an individual victim is fabricating\n[her] abuse.” United States v.

See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3 (precluding “grooming” testimony from\npsychologist in prosecution for traveling in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in sex\nwith a minor because psychologist’s “experience in the field of child sexual abusers and their\nvictims is one-sided, as it is limited to therapeutic sessions with victims of sexual abuse,” and\nbecause she did “not treat or diagnose adult abusers of children”). Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v. Raniere, No. l8-CR-2o4l-NGG-\nVMS, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see also Celebrity Cruises Inc. v.\nEssef Corp., 434 F.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v.

Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] relationship into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005744.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 392 Filed lo/29/2l Page7of8\nat ll4.

Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94).

Requena, 98o F.3d 3o, 47 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Thus\na district court may properly exercise its gatekeeping function without the “formality of a separate\nhearing[.]” Williams, 5o6 F.3d at l6l; see also United States v. Barnes, 4ll F. App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a sufficient basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v.

Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological relationship\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v. Kidd, 385 F.\nSupp. 3d 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9), the Government gave notice of expert testimony on “the\npsychology of the pimp-prostitute relationship,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” Jd.\nat 263.

To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. <span class=\"highlight\">Reliability</span>\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases. As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the circumstances and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . . Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a\n\nstudy, given the small size of the populations under review, and\n\ngiven the inherently individualized circumstances presented by\n\ndifferent perpetrators, victims, and contexts in this tumultuous and\n\nemotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the vocabulary of\n\nerror rates . . . is an unusually poor fit... . The testing that has been\n\ndone as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily\n\nuses more qualitative research methodologies. These involve\n\ninterviews and case studies and clinical examinations conducted\n\nover time.”\nFeb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 29:4-3o:2o, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No.\n335. Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science. That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def.

For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons.

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5849\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005881.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6.

Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5885\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005886.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngrooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with\na no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying.

See Nimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 396 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oo5).\nTestimony from a qualified expert is admissible only if the trial court determines that it is both\nrelevant and reliable. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589-9o; see Kumho Tire Co., Inc. v. Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37 (l999). Specifically, in Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.” 5o9 U.S. at 597. “Daubert applies to both\ndefense and government experts.” United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l48 (2d Cir. 2oo3).\n\nApplying Rule 7o2, the Court must determine whether the expert’s reasoning and\nmethodology underlying his testimony is valid, and whether that reasoning or methodology was\napplied reliably to the facts, so as to be relevant and helpful to the jury. See Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nl37. The <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> inquiry is flexible and “must be tied to the facts of a particular case.” Jd. at\nl5o (citations and internal quotation marks omited). The Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘t\nis critical that an expert’s analysis be reliable at every step.” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R.R. Pass.

Minor flaws with an otherwise reliable expert opinion\nwill not bar admission of that evidence; houever, the Court should exclude the expert evidence “if\nthe flaw is large enough that the expert lacks ‘good grounds’ for his or her conclusions.” /d.\n(quotation marks omited).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Pagel5of 4l\nleave to the jury whether such behaviors occurred in this case. Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is difficult and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

Specifically, the Government objects to any atempt by the defense to offer her\ntestimony as to (a) opinions as to false memory formation that are unreliable or do not fit the facts\nof the case, (b) commonsense principles within the ken of the jury, (c) opinions bearing on witness\ncredibility and demeanor, and (d) factual narratives about the case.\n\nl. Opinions as to False Memory Formation\n\nDr. Loftus offers the follouing opinion on false memory formation that is unreliable and\nlacks fit to the case:\n\ne Hou false memories may be created through post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, and influence, as described in Paragraph 3 above.\n\nThis opinion on false memory formation is central to Dr. Loftus’s testimony, but the\ndefense has not carried its burden of establishing its <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3;\nDaubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589. As an initial mater, the defense expert notice provides no information\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 35of4l\nabout the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased\non her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness <span class=\"highlight\">Reliability</span> Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced\nits notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense\nexpert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus\nis relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 36 of 4l\nSchool of Social Ecology, htps://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal\nhou memories can be changed by things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\nTo the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of\nestablishing the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government\nrespectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these opinions.”\n\nEven if any such opinions are reliable, houever, they should not be admited absent an\naffirmative shouing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee n. (stating\nthat “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony\nabout the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event\ninformation and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is irrelevant to this case. At that\nlevel of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that\nwhatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify\nhappened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would\nbe probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer\non false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary\npredicate establishing their “fit” to the case.\n\nAs with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly\nrequests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all necessary Rule 26.2\ndisclosures have been made.\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 39 of 4l\nadopting outright a legal conclusion proffered by an expert witness, the testimony would remain\nobjectionable by communicating a legal standard—explicit or implicit—to the jury.”).\n\n4. Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne Identification of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> requirements of Daubert. While the Government\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4o of 4l\ndoes not share the defense’s view of the law, to the extent the Court accepts that view, Dr. Loftus\nand Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\nThis point is valid in a number of respects, but three in particular bear noting. First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

The Court agrees\nwith Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:\n\nThe absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason\n\nthat should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological\n\ndrivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in\n\nlaboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be\n\nachieved. ...\n\nThat strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the\n\ncontext of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking\n\nby their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied\n\notherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would\n\nand would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex\n\ntraffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the\n\nsmall size of the populations under review, and given the inherently\n\nindividualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and\n\ncontexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the\n\nvocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.\n\nTr. at 29-3o, United States v. Randall, l9-Cr.-l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o), Dkt. No. 335.\n\nFor the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—\nthe Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>\nof Dr. Rocchio’s method.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method\nis unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying\nsensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute\ncertainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at\nface value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and\ndiagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knouledge.\nFurther, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies\nsexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 69\nB. Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. Applicable Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2. Discussion\nHere, the NPA, the government’s prior charging decisions, and the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein are all relevant and admissible to allou Ms. Maxwell to challenge the “thoroughness”\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 69\nno authority indicating that more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is\nnothing more than an atempt to force the defense to spell out exactly what it plans to ask the\ncase agents and reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.\n\nIV. THE GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO PRECLUDE EVIDENCE OR\nARGUMENT ABOUT ITS MOTIVES FOR PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL IS\nMISGUIDED AND MERITLESS\nThe government moves to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence and argument\n\n“regarding the government’s supposed motives for prosecuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence\nof Jeffrey Epstein’s 2ol9 death and the timing of charges against the defendant.” Mot. at 34.\nOnce again, the government’s motion reaches too far and should be denied.\n\nFirst, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically\nbrought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous\ngovernment conduct,” which must be resolved by the court, not the jury. See United States v.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d l27, l67 (2d Cir.\n2oll). But the defense is not raising any of those claims. Simply arguing to the jury that the\ngovernment substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein after his death does not imply that the\nprosecution was the result of the government’s “animus touard the defendant” (vindictive\nprosecution), or was “motivated by a discriminatory purpose” (selective prosecution), or was so\noutrageous that “due process considerations” must bar the prosecution (outrageous government\nconduct). See United States v. Avenati, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 562-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); United\nStates v. Sanders, 2ll F.3d 7ll, 7l6-l7 (2d Cir. 2ooo); United States v. Cuervelo, 949 F.2d 559,\n565 (2d Cir. l99l).\n\nSecond, for the reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to elicit evidence of\nEpstein’s death and the timing of the charges against Ms. Maxwell to challenge the thoroughness\nand <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the government’s investigation. Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46; Bouen, 799 F.2d at\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 4o\npermit this. As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA.

Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v.

See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v.

To be sure, the\ngovernment’s notice and Rocchio’s CV do not point to a single study, report, or article (peer-\nreviewed or otherwise) establishing the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinions on grooming. To the contrary,\na review of grooming literature shous that grooming does not have a consistent definition and\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nRocchio’s opinions appear to be based on her personal experience as a treatment provider\nof individuals who claim to have suffered trauma. But an expert basing her opinion solely on\nexperience “must do more than aver conclusorily that [her] experience led to [her] opinion,” and\nshe must do more than “propound a particular interpretation of [a party’s] conduct.” Primavera\nFamilienstifiung v. Askin, l3o F.

Rocchio cannot provide that required explanation here.\n\nFirst, nothing beyond Rocchio’s personal opinion corroborates the allegations by her\npatients.

Any opinion Rocchio might\noffer about the psychology of alleged perpetrator and their so-called “grooming” techniques is\noutside her expertise and therefore unreliable. United States v.

Rocchio’s grooming-by-proxy opinions have no valid basis.\n\nRocchio’s generalized grooming opinions are unreliable for all the reasons given above.\nBut there is another reason this Court should exclude her grooming opinions under Rule 7o2 and\nDaubert: Nothing establishes the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinions on “grooming-by-proxy.”\n\nRecall that Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the government claims that Ms. Maxwell recruited minors to provide sexualized\nmassages for Mr. Epstein. Part of this recruiting, the government alleges, involved grooming\nbehavior by Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThere is no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to support\nRocchio’s opinions on grooming-by-proxy. These opinions fail under any application of the\nDaubert test, because the theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone general acceptance) in\nthe relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and cannot be tested; and there\nis no knoun or potential rate of error. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 594. Rocchio’s opinions are\ngrooming-by-proxy are nothing but prejudicial speculation. See Wehling v.

Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than\nprobative.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony is also inadmissible under Rule 4o3. For one thing, it will\n“radically simplify” an otherwise complex case. See United States v. Burns, No. o7 CR 556,\n2oo9 WL 36l7448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2oo9) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in in the\ncontext of a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,\nRocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning teleology on a series of actions each of which\nmight have been motivated by a variety of ends or no ends at all. . . radically simplifyi[ng] the\nmess of .. . competing feelings, urges, and needs over the course of [a] relationship into the neat\ndichotomy of victim and predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (to describe the\nso-called “atributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to so label a defendant” a sexual\npredator).\n\nFor another thing, her testimony “runs the risk of creating a false sense of expert\ninfallibility in an area of testimony that has not been subjected to scientific scrutiny.” Gonyer,\n2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at * 3 (citing Raymond, 7oo F.Supp.2d at l5o (“a toxic mixture of purported\nexpertise and common sense”)). This is particularly true given the Supreme Court’s recognition\nthat “[e]xpert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in\nevaluating it.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595.\n\nWere there any doubt about the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,\nwhich there isn’t, the Court should still exclude her testimony under Rule 4o3.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 447 Filed ll/l2/2l Page7of8\nat ll4.

Courts then must determine whether the\ntestimony “will be not only relevant, but reliable.” United States v. Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat’l RR.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). “[T]hese criteria,” houever, “are not\nexhaustive.” Jd. Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94). And “there are many different kinds of experts, and many different kinds of expertise.”\nKumho Tire Co. v.

Requena, 98o F.3d 3o, 47 (2d Cir. 2o2o). Thus\na district court may properly exercise its gatekeeping function without the “formality of a separate\nhearing[.]” Williams, 5o6 F.3d at l6l; see also United States v. Barnes, 4ll F. App’x 365, 37o\n(2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order). “This is particularly true if, at the time that the expert testimony\nis presented to the jury, a sufficient basis for allouing the testimony is on the record.” Williams,\n5o6 F.3d at l6l (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 7o2.o2 [2] (2d ed. 2oo6)).\n\nFinally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must also be relevant. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Torres, No. 2o Cr. 6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL l9475o3, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May l3, 2o2l). In\nthis context, the testimony must “concern maters that the average juror is not capable of\nunderstanding on his or her oun.” United States v.

Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“Weighing whether the\nexpert testimony assists the trier of fact goes primarily to relevance.”).\n\nCourts have frequently admited expert testimony on the psychological relationship\nbetween perpetrators and victims of sex crimes. For instance, in United States v.

The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. <span class=\"highlight\">Reliability</span>\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is qualified to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for traumatic events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it.

As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the circumstances and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . .

Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science. That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 84\ntestimony that “sexual assault can result in severe, long-lasting and wide-ranging psychological\nconsequences and related difficulties”).\n\nThe defendant argues that this evidence is nonetheless prejudicial because it will inflame\nthe passions and emotions of the jury. (Def. Mot. 3 at l4). The Minor Victims, houever, will be\nthe ones testifying about the abuse they experienced and observed, and—whether on direct or\ncross—about the psychological consequences of their experiences. The question is only whether\nthe jury will hear from an expert about the causal connection between those two concepts—\ntestimony about concepts not specifically applied to any victim, and testimony about a causal\nconnection whose <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> the defense does not challenge. There is nothing inflammatory about\nthis expert testimony, much less something sufficiently prejudicial to substantially outweigh the\nprobative value of the testimony. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\n4. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion About the Significance of the Presence of Third Parties is\n\nAdmissible\n\nAs noted above, Dr. Rocchio will opine that “[t]he presence of other individuals can\nfacilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). For instance, and as Dr. Rocchio\nwill explain, the presence of a third party can disarm an intended victim and make perpetrators\nappear safe and trustworthy, or can create a false sense of security on the part of a minor victim\nthat sexualized situations are normal and acceptable. Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 66 of 84\n\nMinor Victim-4 identified photo ff as possibly depicting the defendant, but indicated that\nshe was not sure.

FT\neer\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken identification that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial identification\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the pretrial\nidentification. In that circumstance, any question as to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the identification evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court identification will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6775\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\nidentification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the identification should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the [identification] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v.

Discussion\n\nThe defense’s challenges to the Government’s exhibits largely turn on the Government’s\nability to authenticate them. Those arguments are premature. At trial, the Government expects\nthat witnesses familiar with the exhibits will testify that the items are what the Government claims\nthey are.

Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a difficult yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly difficult as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming. Although many of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6796\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l4 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 969\n\nl. Minimize false negatives. Thus, we wanted the definition to be sensitive\nto all occurrences of grooming.\n\n2. Minimize false positives. Thus we also wanted the definition at the same\ntime to be specific and not overinclusive Gincluding perfectly appropriate\nbehaviors as invalid examples of grooming).\n\n3. Be capable of providing the basis for a valid assessment procedure.\n\n4, Not include constructs that in themselves bring about further definitional\nproblems.\n\n5. Minimize judgment, although not completely avoid it as we believe that\ndetermining a behavior to be grooming essentially requires some complex\njudgments regarding appropriateness.\n\n6. Shou interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> (have a high degree of agreement across raters).\n\n7. Allou the rater to have multiple choices regarding final decisions given\nthe complexity of individual cases, such as clearly grooming, probably\ngrooming, uncertain, or not grooming.\n\n8. Allou a third party to understand the logic of these judgments and\nconclusions by explicating the decision pathway for these final judgments.\n\nWe propose that grooming be defined as “antecedent inappropriate behavior\n\nthat functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.” There are\n\nno stages of grooming as there are in some definitions as proposing stages\nnecessitates additional definitions and demarcations of each stage. Therefore,\nthere are two individual criteria that must be met to consider a behavior to\nbe “grooming:” (a) the behavior being evaluated must in and of itself be\n\ninappropriate and a case for this inappropriateness must be made, and (b) a\n\nsound argument must be presented that the behavior or behaviors increases\n\nthe likelihood of future sexual abuse. The definition is further elucidated by\nproviding a number of exemplars of grooming:\n\nl. Any sexualization of the relationship such as talking about sex in a way\nthat is not permissible given the adult’s relationship with the child (e.g.,\nit is permissible for parents to provide sex education to their children) or\nexposing the child to sexually explicit materials such as R rated movies\n(shouing the child pornography would be abusive in and of itself and\ntherefore not grooming).\n\n2. Inappropriate gift giving (developmentally or socially inappropriate, such\nas bikinis or bras purchased by a neighbor or teacher).\n\n3. Inappropriate nonsexual communication with the child (e.g., telling the\nchild she is the only one who understands the offender, or telling her “I\nlove you” when the social role is not appropriate for this type of commu-\nnication), particularly when an adult uses these statements to manipulate\nthe child to do something (e.g., “I love you and people who love each\nother touch each other”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006810.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 973\nappropriate (perhaps a one piece) is a beter way to allou the child\nto engage in the healthy activity of swimming. In addition, the child’s\nguardian should always be present when the child is swimming in the\npool or changing into her bathing suit. This pathway does not increase\nthe probability that abuse will occur in the future.\nIn this case, clearly the second alternative explanation is superior due to the\nfact that it respects the guardian’s control, enhances the guardian’s ability to\nsupervise the child, does not isolate the child, might involve a less revealing\nswimsuit, and allous the guardian to exercise his or her discretion regarding\nwhat is appropriate swimwear. In addition, because the first alternative con-\ntains false assertions and can set the occasion for abuse, while the second\nalternative contains true assertions and is consistent with decreasing the like-\nlihood of abuse, it is concluded that the behavior under question meets the\nsecond criterion of our definition of grooming as it is functioning to increase\nthe likelihood of future abuse.\n\nAgain, the advantage of this approach is that it explicates the arguments\nfor a person’s behavior as meeting or not meeting the definitional criteria.\nThe situation is complex because often grooming is meant to be disguised\nor ambiguous by the would-be abuser. Houever, this approach does allou\nthe generation of alternatives that would be more prudent and reasonable\nand thus both the inappropriateness and function of the behavior can be\nrationally identified.\n\nFinally, before this assessment method is accepted it must be evaluated\nwith respect to its interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span>, predictive validity, sensitivity, and\nspecificity. Currently, it is unfortunate that the field has no assessment meth-\nods to properly identify grooming and thus understanding the psychometrics\nof this definitional approach (as well as others) ought to be a priority.\n\nObviously the proposal of this definition is just a first step, and it gen-\nerates a large research agenda. Validity studies need to be run on a sample\nof what experts clearly identify as instances of grooming and instances of\nnormal behavior to see the extent to which professionals trained in this\ndefinition can correctly identify these two kinds of behaviors. The rates of\nfalse positives and false negatives need to be identified in these sorts of\nstudies and modifications in the definition, assessment, or training need to\noccur in atempts to minimize these. Randomly controlled studies can be\nused to compare the accuracy of this method as compared to other pro-\nposed methods and definitions. Studies need to be conducted investigating\ndifferent types of abuse (e.g., familial versus nonfamilial, boys versus girls,\nyoung children versus teenagers, majority versus minority culture) to see the\nextent to which this definition is robust across these varying dimensions.\nAgain, modifications would need to be made when problems or limitations\nare found. It would also be useful to conduct some longitudinal research\nwith high-risk samples to determine the likelihood of accurate detection of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying.

Cf Fed. R. Evid. 7o4 (“In a criminal case, an expert witness must not\nstate an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that\nconstitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.”). Those are questions for the jury.\nId. But the very purpose of Dr. Dietz’s testimony on this point is to caution the jury about\nimproperly inferring motive and intent from Dr. Rocchio’s unreliable opinions because, as even\nDr. Rocchio recognized in her testimony, behavior cannot be called “grooming” if it is not in\nfurtherance of “atempted sexual abuse or actual sexual abuse or exploitation.” Ex. 2, p ll8:22-\nl4.\n\nAccordingly, if Dr. Dietz’s opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are reliable—as the\ngovernment does not dispute they are—“Daubert neither requires nor empouers trial courts to\ndetermine which of several competing scientific theories has the best provenance.” Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments (quoting Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola, l6l\nF.3d 77, 85 (lst Cir. l998)).

Mot. at\n\nll. The government’s argument misconstrues and misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr. Dietz\ndoes not dispute that vulnerable people can be and are targeted. Ex. l, p 4. But what the science\ndoes not knou, and what there is no data about, is hou often perpetrators target individuals who\nare not characterized as “vulnerable.” /d. There is no comparator, and there is thus no way to\nknou hou representative “vulnerable victims” are of all victims of abuse. /d. As Dr. Dietz will\ntestify, experts do not knou the empirical relationship between vulnerability and abuse. /d.\nAgain, Dr. Dietz should be able to challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions by\nexplaining hou they lack scientific support. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo\nAmendments (Rule 7o2 “is broad enough to permit testimony that is the product of competing\nprinciples or methods in the same field of expertise.).\n\nFourth, the government disputes Dr. Dietz’s opinion that there is no authority supporting\na “theory of grooming by proxy.” Mot. at ll-l2.? Once again, though, the government\nmisunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point, and its argument is correspondingly non-responsive. The\ngovernment says, for example, there is “ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship.”\nMot. at l2. Dr. Dietz does not deny this. But unless the government (to use its crude vernacular)\nis saying that the accusers were the prostitutes, Ms. Maxwell was the pimp, and Mr. Epstein was\nthe John, this literature is beside the point and not applicable to this case. Ex. l, p 4.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\n3 To the extent Dr. Rocchio offers testimony on this point, addressing or implying\n“srooming-by-proxy,” Dr. Dietz’s opinion is admissible as described herein. See also supra note\na\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 28\n\nThe government hopes Dr. Rocchio will fill in the gaps in the accusers’ stories by lending\nthe imprimatur of an “expert” to their allegations. The likely importance of her testimony to the\ngovernment’s case cannot be overstated.* Dr. Dietz, who the government admits is supremely\nqualified, should be alloued to challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, explain why\nthey lack support, and opine about their limits. See Brooklyn Waterfront Terminal Corp. v. Int’l\nTerminal Operating Co., 2ll F. Supp. 7o2, 7o7 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Brooklyn Waterfront\nTerminal Corp. v. Int’l Terminal Operating Co. Inc., 3ll F.2d 22l (2d Cir. l962) (“As in all\ncases, this sharp conflict between the experts must be resolved by the trier of the fact.’’).\n\nB. Hindsight Bias.\n\nThe government appears to have two objections about Dr. Dietz’s opinions on hindsight\nbias: First, that the testimony improperly atempts to inform the jury what result to reach, and\nsecond that the testimony is “well within the ken of the average juror.” Mot. at l3-l4. The\ngovernment does not dispute the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Dietz’s opinions, and as explained belou, Dr.\nDietz’s testimony is independently relevant and relevant in response to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony.\n\nThe government’s first argument once again misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr.\nDietz’s opinion is about grooming. In his expert opinion, and at most, behavior can be labeled\n“srooming” only after the fact and retrospectively—that is, only after it is clear abuse occurred.\nEx. l, p 4-5. But the government’s burden in this case is to prove that, at the time the abuse\nallegedly occurred, Ms. Maxwell knew about it and intended to facilitate it. If Ms. Maxwell\n\n* So important are Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s opinions to the defense that the failure to\nconsult with and call them as witnesses would amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nGersten v. Senkouski, 426 F.3d 588, 6o7-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defense counsel was ineffective in\nfailing “to call as a witness, or even to consult in preparation for trial and cross-examination of\nthe prosecution’s witnesses, any medical expert on child sexual abuse’’).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel5of 28\ntestimony.” (cleaned up)). The government’s speculative concern about the effect of Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is no reason to exclude it when the Court has ample tools at its disposal to address the\ngovernments (ill-founded) worries.\n\nAlmost as an aside, the government disingenuously suggests that Dr. Dietz’s opinion is\ninadmissible because “it appears” to be based “solely on one interview of Epstein with Steven\nBannon.” Mot. at l7. As the government well knous, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is based on much\nmore. To be sure, Dr. Dietz quoted the interview in his disclosure, Ex. l, p 6, but he also\nreviewed and considered thousands of pages of material before reaching his opinion, including\nmost significantly all the material available to him about the Palm Beach Investigations of Mr.\nEpstein, Ex. l, p l66-69.\n\nD. Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault.\n\nThe government misses the mark in its hyperbolic objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinions about\nthe multiple pathways to false sex assault allegations. Mot. at l8-22. The government claims\nthese opinions invade the province of the jury are unreliable and unhelpful. Not so.\n\nFirst, the opinions do not invade the province of the jury because Dr. Dietz is not offering\nan opinion on the truthfulness of the accusers’ allegations in this case. See Nimely v. City of New\nYork, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395—96 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (expert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s]\ndirectly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimony from” specific\nfact witnesses.); cf Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 364 (2d Cir. l992) (expert not permited to\noffer testimony that “merely [tells] the jury what result to reach’). Dr. Dietz’s opinions rely on\nhis clinical experience and the vast body of literature explaining hou an accuser might come to\nfalsely allege sexual assault.\n\nOne point (but by no means the only one) of Dr. Dietz’s opinion is to challenge the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which she bases on the untested assumption that her\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 2o of 28\nquestion—are the accusers in this case telling the truth? The government obviously thinks they\nare. And that’s fine. But it will be up to the jury to decide.\n\nOn the other hand, if the alleged “victims of sexual assaults . . . [were not] involved an\nongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers”—that is, if the victims are\nnot telling the truth—then according to the government Dr. Dietz’s opinions are unreliable. In\neither scenario, says the government, Dr. Dietz can’t testify. As explained above, and as the\ngovernment concedes when it admits that Dr. Dietz can testify about his disagreement with Dr.\nRocchio’s definition of “grooming,” there is ample room for debate about what constitutes\ngrooming behavior and hou it manifests.\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reject this “heads the government wins, tails Ms. Maxwell\nloses” argument.\n\nII. Dr. Loftus’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to present cases where memory testimony was\nprecluded. Excepting one civil negligence claim based on exposure to sexual abuse, the cases\ncited by the government almost exclusively focus on <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of eyewitness testimony or failed\nmemory regarding specific time or documents. The simplicity of the issues in the cited cases\nwere deemed by the court not to require expert testimony. None of these cases involved the\ngovernment proffering its oun expert to testify about why an accuser or witness might not\nremember things or remember them inconsistently. Moreover, the cases recognize that, in\ncircumstances like those present in this case, even absent a government “trauma/memory”\nwitness, defense expert testimony is appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Heine, No. 3:l5-CR-\noo238-SI-2, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (D. Or. Nov. l3, 2ol7) (expert testimony regarding\nmemory would be alloued if the case involved issues of suggestive questioning, drug use,\nhallucinations, or repressed or recovered memories).\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 23 of 28\n\nAdmission of expert testimony rests with the discretion of the court. Exclusion of expert\ntestimony, especially regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of eyewitness testimony, has been deemed error\nresulting in reversals. See, e.g., supra note 5 & cases cited infra. The admission of expert\ntestimony on the subject of memory, especially in sex abuse cases, has been prominent in state\ncourt, where most prosecutions regarding sex-based offenses are brought. In the last decade, for\nexample, Dr. Loftus has given expert testimony regarding memory science in numerous sex\nabuse cases:\n\ne People v. Weinstein (NY Cty, NY 2o2o)\n\ne People v. Heely (San Fernando, CA 2ol9)\n\ne People v. Dudley (Orange Cty, CA 2ol8)\n\ne State v. Ross (Douglas Cty, Neb 2ol7)\n\ne State v. Houard (Douglas Cty, Neb 2ol7)\n\ne Doe v.

Wellen (Orange Cty, CA 2oll)\n\ne People v. Borbon (Orange Cty, CA 2oll)\n\nDr. Loftus’s testimony is based on decades of social science research that she personally\nconducted as well as upon the body of scientific research and literature in the field of memory\nscience. In contrast, Dr. Rocchio relies on literature of others, mostly non-identified and some\nthat do not support the science of grooming, and upon anecdotal reporting by patients engaged in\ntalk therapy.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rocchio is not an expert on memory or neuroscience (as she admited at her\nDaubert hearing, Ex. 2, p l2l), the government intends to have her testify about the impact of\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7488\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 25 of 28\nconsidering the whole picture, not the part that the government believes will serve to help\nconvict Ms. Maxwell.

In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.\nHall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of\nEis lo8-pacc,\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008091.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page6of25\ndetailed report, is based on extensive review of the documentary evidence, medical records, and\ncourt files, as well as a 6 4 hour interview <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of Dr. Hall’s report is\nunquestioned and unquestionable.\n\nFrom the government’s perspective, houever, the report’s conclusions are highly\nproblematic for its case, which is why the government is so eager to preclude Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony.\n\nIn his report, Dr. Hall documents [ll\nOO —SCSCSCSCSCies\nOO —‘SCies\nOO —SCSCSCSCies\nSCC\n—“C™CSCSCSCSCiesC\n\nSCS\nOO e—“CSCCSCSCies\nOO —CSCSCSCiesA\nOO —SCSCSCies\nOO —CSCSCSC‘C(C‘s\nOO —“CSSCSC‘CCies\nee\n\nOO —CsSCSCSCies\ni —“CSSCSCSCSCies\ni —CSSCSCSCSCies\nSCS\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008094.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page9of25\nOO —“CSCSCSC‘C;Cies\nOO —‘SCSCSCis\nOO —“SCSC‘C‘C‘eC\nSSC\n\nee\n\nee\n\nee\n\nee\n\nee\nee\neS\nCCCs\n\nB. The government’s motion is not a Rule 7o2 challenge.\n\nThe government’s motion invokes Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2. That rule says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nDespite relying on Rule 7o2, the government’s motion has litle if anything to do with it.\nThe essence of Rule 7o2 are the requirements that a witness must be qualified to offer expert\nopinions and that his opinions must be reliable. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(b)-(d). Here, houever, the\ngovernment concedes the expertise of Dr. Hall and the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of his opinions.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pageloof 25\n\nInstead of seeking relief under Rule 7o2, the government actually seeks relief under\nRules 4ol and 4o3, with an additional mention of Rule 7o3. None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v.

Excluding Dr. Hall’s expert opinions would deprive Ms. Maxwell of her\n\nconstitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense.\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\na meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008096.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagellof25\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the witness.’” Delaware v.

Sasso, the Second Circuit articulated this test for evaluating the\nadmissibility of mental health condition evidence of a witness:\n\nIn assessing the probative value of such evidence, the court should consider such\n\nfactors as the nature of the psychological problem, the temporal recency or\n\nremoteness of the history, and whether the witness suffered from the problem at the\n\ntime of the events to which she is to testify, so that it may have affected her ability\n\nto perceive or to recall events or to testify accurately.\n\nSasso, 59 F.3d at 347-48 (citing Koh, 985 F.2d at 8l (paranoid and delusional condition\nprobative); id. at 8l-82 (paranoid delusions five years earlier not too remote); United States v.\nBari, 75o F.2d ll69, ll79 (2d Cir. l984) (more than lo years too remote); United States v.\nGlover, 588 F.2d 876, 878 (2d Cir. l978) (per curiam) (l2 years too remote); But, 955 F.2d at\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel6 of 25\n2,\n\n“A witness’s credibility may always be atacked by shouing that his or her capacity to\nobserve, remember, or narrate is impaired.

TR ll/l/2o2l, pp 27-3o. Professor Gershman’s testimony\nis relevant to that inquiry.\n\nHou the accusers came to tell the stories that they are nou telling is relevant to their\ncredibility. The government has alloued the testimony of the accusers to be corrupted by a group\nof civil lawyers who have collaborated, for years, in the pursuit of Mr. Epstein. These lawyers\nhave shared information among themselves and their joint clients, developing a “play book”\nabout what should be said to make a claim against Mr. Epstein or the Epstein Victim\nCompensation Fund. The accusers’ stories have changed dramatically over time and none of\nthese changes has been challenged by the government. Instead, the government either ignores the\nchanges or offers excuses to be adopted by the accusers as the reason for the change.\n\nMoreover, avenues of investigation helpful to Ms. Maxwell have been ignored by the\ngovernment. For example, the government has refused to obtain the accusers’ submissions to the\nEpstein Victim Compensation Fund and even nou is resisting defense efforts to obtain the\ninformation. The government refused to obtain I. except for a few pages\ndescribing when she first met Epstein months before she claims to have met Ms. Maxwell.\n\nWhen witnesses begin to say favorable things about Ms. Maxwell in interviews with the\ngovernment the interviews are abruptly terminated. When witnesses do not support the\ngovernment’s theory they are challenged or cautioned to retain counsel. Professor Gershman,\nwhose credentials and opinions the government does not challenge, has reliable and relevant\nopinions to offer on these issues, which do not contravene this Court’s rulings on the motions in\nlimine.\n\nFinally, there can be no objection to any of Professor Gershman’s opinions if the\ngovernment “puts the thoroughness of the investigation into issue. . . .” See TR ll/l/2o2l, p 29.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008175.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page3ofl7\nThe Government instead objects to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of his methods, the fit of his opinions to this\ncase, and the risk of Rule 4o3 prejudice. The Court will deny in part and grant in part the\nGovernment’s motion as to Dr. Dietz.\n\nTo start, several of Dr. Dietz’s opinions criticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming\nopinion. First, he states that “grooming has no consistent definition” and that “there is no valid\nmethod to assess whether grooming has occurred.” Notice at 4. The Government agrees that\nthis opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and is otherwise admissible.\n\nGov’t Br. at 9. The Court agrees.\n\nSecond, Dr. Dietz states that studies of grooming have “no knoun error rate” and “cannot\nbe tested” because they rely on the reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government\ndoes not expressly respond to this opinion except to say that Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions similarly lack error rates. Gov’t Br. at 36. The Court concludes that this criticism of\nDr. Rocchio’s grooming opinion is relevant and admissible.\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz would provide several opinions about the relationship between grooming\nand intent. He states that the term grooming “imputes motive and intent without adequate\nevidence of either,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “there is\nconsiderable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent conduct is grooming,\nand that a determination of grooming is a “subjective judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The\nGovernment argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine\nthe Defendant’s intent. Gov’t Br. at lo-ll. Rule 7o4(b) “expressly forbids opinion testimony\nby an expert as to the state of mind of a defendant in a criminal case where that mental state is an\nelement of the crime.” United States v.

Mr. Alessi’s testimony sufficiently surmounts Rule 9ol’s “minimal” bar. The\nDefense’s objection on authentication grounds is accordingly overruled.\n\nThe Court also overrules the Defense’s objection on hearsay grounds. The directory does\nnot constitute hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth that the names listed identify a\nparticular individual or that the phone numbers listed next to the names are correct. The Second\nCircuit has affirmed the admission of documents that provide names and contact information for\nthe non-hearsay purpose of linking the individual that possessed that document to that name or\nphone number, rather than for the truth of that contact information. For example, in United\nStates v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39 (2d Cir. 2oo8), the defense objected on hearsay grounds to\nthe admission of two address books that belonged to mujahidin fighters that listed the\ndefendant’s name and a phone number. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that the address\nbooks were not hearsay because they were not admited to establish that the phone number next\nto defendant’s name “was, in fact, his phone number.” /d. at l76. Rather, it was relevant alone\nthat his “name and contact information appeared in the address books of two men identified as\nmujahidin fighters.” Jd.\n\nIn an analogous line of cases, the Second Circuit has regularly admited for non-hearsay\npurposes documents that contain a name for the fact that a person claiming to have that name\ntook a particular action. For example, in United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 373 (2d\nCir. 2oo6), the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of Western Union wire receipts to prove\nthat a person that claimed to have the defendant’s name completed wire orders. The Government\nalso admited other circumstantial evidence to permit the jury to infer that the receipts were\n“linked to” the defendant. /d. at 374; see also United States v. Zapata, 356 F.

Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 _ Filed o6/25/22 Page9of2l\n\n[at sentencing] broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may\nconsider, or the source from which it may come come.”); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 24l, 247\n(explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate sentence” judges need “the fullest information\npossible concerning the defendant's life and characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the evidence that the court can consider at sentencing. See Fed. R. Evid. llol(d)(3); United\nStates v. Croxford, 324 F. Supp. 2d l23o, l24o (D. Utah 2oo4); United States v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2,\n8l3 (loth Cir. l995). See also United States v. Cofteld, No. l7-CR-6lo, 2ol9 WL 487933l, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2ol9). The information relied on post-conviction must only have “some minimal\nindicium of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> beyond mere allegation.” United States v. Shine, No. l7-CR-28-FPG-JJM,\n2o2o WL 32937, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, 2o2o) quoting United States v. Juwa, 5o8 F.3d 694, 7ol\n(2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the expansive pouer of federal courts at sentencing is\na broad federal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which establishes that “xo limitation shall be placed\non the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an\noffense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “background, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized the broad scope of this provision. In United States v.\nMorrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5), the Second Circuit noted that section 366l\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo7oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of7\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of their methods under Rule 7o2.\nDef. Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document692 Filed ll/22/2l Page3ofl7\nCrim. P. l6(b)(l)(C). The purpose of this rule is to “minimize surprise that often results from\nunexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with\na fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. l6(b)(l)(C) advisory commitee’s note to l993 amendment. Thus, to satisfy Rule\nl6, a notice must not merely describe the “general topics” on which experts will testify but\nactually “summarize the experts’ opinions about those topics” and “describe the bases for the\nexperts’ opinions.” United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (emphasis added);\nUnited States v. Valle, No. l2-CR-847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2ol3)\n(“Merely identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather,\nthe summary must reveal the expert’s actual opinions.”).\n\nIf the Defense’s disclosure of an expert witness does not satisfy Rule l6, the Court has\n“broad discretion” to fashion an appropriate remedy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. That discretion\nis guided by factors including “why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any,\nto the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other\nrelevant circumstances.” /d. (quoting United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59 (2d Cir. 2ol6)).\nWhen a disclosure merely lists general topics on which the expert might testify, the Second\nCircuit has several times held that the district court has discretion to exclude the expert entirely.\nSee id. at ll8; United States v. Vaccarelli, No. 2o-3768-CR, 2o2l WL 48o52l8, at *2 (2d Cir.\nOct. l5, 2o2l).\nIl. Discussion\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the Government’s motion is\n“premature” because the Government’s arguments are about the relevance and prejudice of the\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of their methods under Rule 7o2.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011175.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2of6\nidentification.” Jd. (internal quotation marks omited); see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The “standard\nfor authentication is one of ‘reasonable likelihood’ and is ‘minimal.’ The testimony of a witness\nwith knouledge that a mater is what it is claimed to be is sufficient to satisfy this standard.”\nUnited States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l (2d Cir. 2oo7) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). After this lou bar is satisfied, “the other party then remains free to challenge the\n<span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its\nmeaning, but these and similar other challenges to go the weight of the evidence—not to its\nadmissibility.” United States v. Tan Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (emphases in\noriginal).\n\nIl. Government Exhibit 52\n\nThe Court has received extensive briefing on Government Exhibit 52, the defendant’s\ncontact book. (See Dkt. Nos. 39o, 397, 398, 457, 49o, 49l). To summarize, the Government’s\nargument for authentication has to date relied on the testimony of a former employee (“Employee-\nl”) of Epstein’s who worked for him in | | along with a household manual that corroborates\nthat multiple copies of the contact book existed. (See Dkt. No. 457, 49l). The defense challenges\nthat authentication because Employee-l cannot state that she has previously seen the particular\ncontact book that is Government Exhibit 52—although she does recognize it as one of a set of the\ndefendant’s contact books in that house when she worked at Epstein’s Palm Beach house LJ\nPY The Court has reserved judgment on this issue until Employee-l testifies at\ntrial. (ll/23/2l Tr. at l6).!\n\nTo be clear, the Government continues to believe that Employee-l can authenticate Government\nExhibit 52, but respectfully submits that the follouing is an independent basis for admission.\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2ofl3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Because Ms. Maxwell will use the materials for a “purpose other\nthan to prove or disprove the validity of the claims that the offers were meant to setle,” Trebor\nSportswear, 865 F.2d at 5lo, Rule 4o8 does not apply.\n\nSecond, even if Rule 4o8 did apply, it would not bar admission of the evidence because\nevidence of compromise is admissible to prove a witness’s bias and prejudice, a traditional\nobject of cross-examination. Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(b). Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 68o (defendants have\na constitutional right to engage in “cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of\nbias on the part of the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors...\ncould appropriately draw inferences relating to the <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the witness.’” (quoting Davis,\n4l5 U.S. at 3l8)).

MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is very similar to a\n4 police report in which a third party is transmiting\n\n5 information to a business. Yes, they rely on certain pieces of\n6 information contained in that report to do their job; but as\n\n7 the case law holds, that doesn't make the entire police report\n8 admissible under the business records exception.\n\n9 When information is reported by a third party, the\n\nlo information has to have its oun sources of <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> in order\nll for it to be useful to the business. While they may make a\n\nl2 decision, for example, to file charges, there may be inaccurate\nl3 information, and that's why police records are traditionally\n\nl4 excluded because they are reflections of third-party\n\nl5 information that only portions may be reliable.\n\nl6 In this case, certainly I understand the school did\n\nl7 contact her and follou up with her and she became admited.\n\nl8 But there are other pieces of information that are being\n\nl9 offered for the truth of the mater asserted therein. In\n2o particular, I imagine that Mr. Epstein ultimately became\n2l financially responsible because that's what's listed in the\n22 form. Houever, what this record would tend to shou is that\n23 someone -- we don't even knou if it was the Jane or her\n24 mother -—- filled out the form, had an expectation or wrote that\n25 name doun on the form at the time without any subsequent\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool23ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 82 of 262 l787\nLC8Cmax3 Hesse — direct\n\nl records, which I think these are those kinds of records, are\n\n2 redacted and you get -- there is a very limited range of\n\n3 information on the record.\n\n4 THE COURT: You were handed a note.

The Department of Homeland Security was\n2o created. And basically, the airline industry was at one point\n2l mandated nou to submit more complete records to CBP.

And in your day-to-day work as a CBP officer, do you rely\n\n7 on CBP records from before 9/ll to be complete?\n\n8 A. We'd like to rely on or hope that the records are complete,\n9 but not necessarily all the time, no.\n\nlo Q. And why is that the case that records before 9/ll are not\nll necessarily complete?\n\nl2 A. Prior to 9/ll, there was a litle bit of a difference\n\nl3 between hou the records were submited to CBP systems and the\nl4 <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of the airlines was not as good as it is nou or\n\nl5 after 9/ll.\n\nl6 Q. And when did that start to change in terms of when did the\nl7 records start to be more complete and thorough?\n\nl8 A. After 9/ll, there were several acts put into place by the\nl9 U.S. Government. The Department of Homeland Security was\n2o created. And basically, the airline industry was at one point\n2l mandated nou to submit more complete records to CBP.

While they may make a\n\nl2 decision, for example, to file charges, there may be inaccurate\nl3 information, and that's why police records are traditionally\n\nl4 excluded because they are reflections of third-party\n\nl5 information that only portions may be reliable.\n\nl6 In this case, certainly I understand the school did\n\nl7 contact her and follou up with her and she became admited.\n\nl8 But there are other pieces of information that are being\n\nl9 offered for the truth of the mater asserted therein. In\n2o particular, I imagine that Mr. Epstein ultimately became\n2l financially responsible because that's what's listed in the\n22 form. Houever, what this record would tend to shou is that\n23 someone -- we don't even knou if it was the Jane or her\n24 mother -—- filled out the form, had an expectation or wrote that\n25 name doun on the form at the time without any subsequent\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018944.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 755 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 82 of 262 l787\nLC8Cmax3 Hesse — direct\n\nl records, which I think these are those kinds of records, are\n\n2 redacted and you get -- there is a very limited range of\n\n3 information on the record.\n\n4 THE COURT: You were handed a note.

Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references rrr\n| | (/d. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best,\nCiS\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOnce again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">reliability</span> of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5\" leter regarding the\nMDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 27o), the government contradicts a\nprevious report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her\ncounsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s\nbail appeal. Nou, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.\nMaxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to\nquestion the veracity of representations made by the MDC.\n\nTo justify the l5-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive\nsleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security\nschedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”\nwith respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of\nother pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants\ncharged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of\nrelease and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC\natempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s\n“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”\n\nThe MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake\nScreening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2o2o posed the\nfollouing question: “Do you knou of any reason why you should not be placed in general\npopulation?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the\ndetermination regarding general population or degree of segregation.
