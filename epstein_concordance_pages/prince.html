Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the <span class=\"highlight\">prince</span> himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement.

Fla. 2ol2), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its\nemployees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a\nthird-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a shouing that the\nparties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the\nclass. /d. at l228.

Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliou him to receive only a slap on the\nwrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 2o-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hiting\nlawyers—Alan Dershouitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among\nthem—toc escape equal justice?\nMichael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to\nthe transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained hou the case against Epstein\nwas minimized by the State Atorney's Office, then bargained doun by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an\natmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several\ncolleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2oo9 and nou runs his oun security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea\nagreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the\ndeposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”\nIn March 2o65, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a l4-year-old girl, launched an\ninvestigation that would eventually uncover a patern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning\nseveral continents, knouingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever\nEpstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the\nbeter,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who\ndeclared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would\nbe giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and\nsometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $2oo or more, depending on hou far things\nwent, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,ooo cash on hand.\nThe Palm Beach Potice Department identified l7 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;\nthe youngest was l4, and many were younger than l6. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the\nworld—he also ouns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by\nihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2ool, indentified roughly 4o victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein\nreferred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age l4.

A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid\n\"Bright Young Things,\" writen by one of their oun, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this croud as a bunch of\ntwits living off their trust funds.\nGhislaine's oun funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the\ncrash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to oun an apartment on the\nUpper East Side and a mews house in London.\nShe is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly\nhas holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright ouner.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see <span class=\"highlight\">Prince</span> Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032094.jpg": "Trilateral Commission Members Page 2 of 9\nDomingo F.
