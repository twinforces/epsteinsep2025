Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a\nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.\npassports for young girls to “work” as models.

The Government has raised various relevancy objections\nto the documents that Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 are atempting to obtain. The current\nvictims have responded by explaining hou these documents are relevant, including explaining\nhou these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his pouerful political and\nsocial connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s\nmotive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to\nmaintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knouledge. See, e.g.,\n\nDE 266 at 6-lo. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of\nthese requests, as well as the need for those requests.\n\nOne clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding\nEpstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea\narrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by <span class=\"highlight\">Prince</span>\nAndrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershouitz.

See,\n\ne.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at l6-l8).

The Indictment also contains two\nconspiracy counts that charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein. /d. 9] 9, l5.\n\nAccording to the government, houever, Ms. Maxwell’s status as an alleged co-\nconspirator of Epstein is somehou insufficient for an NPA that immunizes “potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein” to apply to her. The government claims that there is “no evidence that\nthe parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular.” Opp. 2o. In essence, the\ngovernment implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking\nabout “in particular” qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has\nconcocted, and case law is to the contrary.\nFor example, in United States v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9\n(S.D. Fla. 2ol2), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its\nemployees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a\nthird-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a shouing that the\nparties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the\nclass. /d. at l228. Similarly, in United States v. El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio\n2ool), where a Saudi <span class=\"highlight\">prince</span> had entered into an agreement with the government that none of the\nindividuals involved in purchasing guns for two members of the Saudi royal family would be\nprosecuted, the court did not require the defendant to shou that the government and the <span class=\"highlight\">prince</span>\nintended to immunize him “in particular”; to the contrary, as the court noted, the parties to the\nagreement did not even discuss the defendant. /d. at 6o4.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo388o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003981.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page loofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

By allouing a potential source of such material to\n\nremain in the possession of the very witness whose credibility it might be used to\n\nimpeach, the government created a serious risk that significant material would be\n\ndestroyed or tampered with.[*]Under the circumstances, the diary should have been\n\nimpounded with the court, subject to use and inspection by both sides under\n\nconditions that would protect the defendants from destruction or alteration, and the\n\nwitness from unwarranted invasions of privacy or disclosure of information that\n\nmight jeopardize his safety.

A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid\n\"Bright Young Things,\" writen by one of their oun, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this croud as a bunch of\ntwits living off their trust funds.\nGhislaine's oun funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the\ncrash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to oun an apartment on the\nUpper East Side and a mews house in London.\nShe is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly\nhas holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright ouner.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see <span class=\"highlight\">Prince</span> Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032094.jpg": "Trilateral Commission Members Page 2 of 9\nDomingo F.
