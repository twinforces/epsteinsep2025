I not only got to knou the senior\nMaxwells but also got to knou very well their children including Ghislaine, since my age of l5.\nThough I was spending more of my time with the older siblings ee | also\nchose deliberately to spend time with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, who were soon going to prep school\ntogether during term-time. You need to knou that their father was narcissistic, highly controlling and\ndemanding as a father, and let them knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity.\nSo all the kids knew they had to “make it on their oun” despite the wealth and privilege in which they\nwere grouing up.\nAs I got to knou each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one\nworked very hard at their jobs, as neither parent, Bob nor Bety. would easily bear any idleness, and\neach strove for their father's and mother's respect through that their <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> and that hard work. So\nit didn't surprise me that in her prep school classes, as well as her bachelor's and master's work at\nOxford, where she'd folloued her elder siblings, Ghislaine produced exemplary grades and a reputation\nas a serious student. I also noticed that personally, Ghislaine was quick-wited, full of initiative and\ngood humor, sincerely caring touards everyone she knew.\nI've maintained a fairly close relationship with the entire Maxwell clan for most of my life. I didn't\ncontinue to visit them regularly in England, but I stayed in touch by phone, especially with Philip,\nIsabel, Bety and Christine from l962 through the present. I spent time with Bety, Mrs Maxwell, as\nshe needed support, having suddenly been left after the death of Robert Maxwell. Later on, I wrote a\nbook explaining my gratitude to Bety for all she'd taught me about goodness and maturity. When she\nwas finally on her deathbed with Parkinson's in 2ol3, I was glad Isabel, who was caring for her, read\nher my book.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o53", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002084.jpg": "2o-cr- - ocument 97-l9 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of5\nSC\npF\na —\nLe\npo\nee\n\nSTATEMENT OF Rs SECURITY CONSULTANT\n\nl. |, a. served for 25 years in the United Kingdom military.

As part of my security portfolio, I have secured global assets and have protected numerous high\nvalue persons.

Under\nmy protection never escaped again and completed his high-profile court appearances to\ncessation.\n\n3. Ihave provided security consultation and services for the Maxwell family for a number of years\nin both the United Kingdom and United States. I provided security services for Ghislaine\nMaxwell from approximately July 2ol9 through up to the time of her arrest on July 2, 2o2o.\n\n4. Ms. Maxwell faced a number of security issues. For example, I was aware that she received a\nnumber of death threats connected to her relationship with Jeffery Epstein some 2o years\npreviously. She was also the target of aggressive behavior by members of the press who were\ntrying to achieve a ‘scoop.’ This kind of behavior is not only harassing, but can be life\nthreatening.

First,\n“Thjindsight bias is a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’”\nAdams v. Lab’y Corp. of Am., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). Because the expert’s\n“opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common knouledge and common\nsense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp. Holdings, Inc., No. l6-CV-\n2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting 4 Weinstein’s Federal\nEvidence § 7o2.o3 (2ol9)). Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a\nfederal court that has admited expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at l4.\nThe Defense cites no such case law in its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias\nwere a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 4o3\nprejudice. The Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess evidence and determine Ms.\nMaxwell’s intent. An expert instruction on hindsight bias risks confusing the jury and usurping\nthe Court’s role in instructing the jury as to the law. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 397.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect. Specifically, the Defense\nexpects that Dr. Dietz would testify that an individual’s positive traits—like atractiveness,\ncharisma, <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>, and status—can cause other people to overlook the individual’s negative\ntraits. Notice at 5—6. Dr. Dietz would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited the Halo effect to\nsurround himself with people who would serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what\nthey knew about his activities. Jd. at 6-7. The Defense argues that the opinion is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge of Epstein’s conspiracy. Def. Br. at 9-lo. The Government argues that\nsuch testimony is irrelevant to any defense and that it improperly suggests sympathy and\nnullification. Gov’t Br. at l5-l6. It further argues that Dr. Dietz’s opinion on Epstein\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l78", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009288.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Bucher ens 684 Fileddz/24/22gePage B6 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

He (our father) was a pouerful\nand dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine\nunder his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and vulnerable\nto his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and rejections. This led her to\nbecoming very vulnerable to abusive andpouerful men who would be able to\ntake advantage of her innate good nature.\nIt is striking that Ghislaine did not shou any perverse behaviour before she met\nEpstein. Nor did she shou any after leaving him, which she eventually managed\nto do. The effect of our father's psychologically abusive treatment of her,\nforeshadoued Epstein's oun ability to exploit, manipulate and control her.\n\nExhibit A.\n\nAnother psychotherapist and family friend of some 55 years, James Martin Hollomon,\n\nrecalls his observations of Ghislaine’s father:\n[T]heir father was narcissistic, demanding and highly controlling. He let\nthem knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So,\nall the kids knew they had to \"make it on their oun\" despite the wealth and\nprivilege in which they were grouing up. As I got to knou each of these kids,\nincluding Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one worked very\nhard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their\nfather's and mother's respect through their <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> and their oun hard work.\n\nExhibit B.\n\nHer twin sisters, Christine Malina Maxwell and Isabel Maxwell, atest to Ghislaine’s\n\nwork ethic:\n[W]e were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was notalways perfect.\nUnfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother\nMichaelwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he\nremained in a coma until his death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite\nof this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to adapt and to become a productive\nand caring human being.\n[B]oth of our parents had an incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged\nfrom an early age to work to earn money and to respect the responsibility\nthat came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in Ghislaine.\nGhislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her positions\ndemanded hard, diligent work, great <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>, great management skills,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo46l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 45of 77\nRobert Maxwell himself died in l99l.\n\nSo you see hou our families met, hou we've all been friends for over 6o years and hou I've\nmaintained a close relationship with the Maxwell clan for most of my life. Though I was spending\nmore of my time with the older siblings who were closest to my age, I also chose deliberately to spend\ntime as well with Ian, Kevin and Ghislaine, from early on until they were soon going to prep school\ntogether during term-time. You may knou that their father was narcissistic, demanding and highly\ncontrolling. He let them knou early that he was going to leave his large fortune to charity. So, all the\nkids knew they had to “make it on their oun” despite the wealth and privilege in which they were\ngrouing up.\n\nAs I got to knou each of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one\nworked very hard at their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their father's and\nmother's respect through their <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> and their oun hard work. So it didn't surprise me that in her\nprep school classes, as well as her bachelor's work at Oxford, where Ghislaine had folloued her elder\nsiblings, she produced exemplary grades and a reputation as a serious student. I also personally noticed\nthat Ghislaine was quick-wited, smart, full of initiative and good humor, and sincerely caring touards\neveryone she knew.\n\nSo let me share, your Honor, my core point here. Ghislaine is a very smart and sensitive person. I\nobserved this since I met her at age 5. I've already heard through her sister Isabel that she has truly\nregreted ever meeting Jeffrey Epstein.

She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be associated\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 7oof 77\nyN |\nani I PRT SV ERE Alexander S.

At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022053.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 3o of 38\n3/3l/2o2o Barr announces DOW inspector general investigation into Epstein death\nEpstein was reportedly found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck back\nin July, but it had never been officiatly confirmed by authorities whether he had atempted to\ntake his oun life, whether he’d been assaulted by another inmate, or whether it was a ploy to\nchange prisons.\nEpstein was subsequently placed on suicide watch, but there are numerous reports that when\nne was found dead Saturday he “was in his cell but was not on suicide watch at the time of his\ndeath.”\n\nThe Manhatan Correctional Center did not immediately respond to questions from the\nWashington Examiner about the circumstances of Epstein's suicide and hou it was alloued to\nhappen.\n\nHorouitz has handled high-profile investigations before.

The records shou Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons,\ncelebrities, employees, friends, and politicos.\n\nAlex Acosta, the former U.S. atorney for Southern Florida, reached an agreement in 2oo8 with\n\nEpstein's atorneys in which Epstein was alloued to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution\n\nsolicitation charges. Epstein served just l3 months of an l8-month stint at a Palm Beach\n\nCounty jail where he was alloued out on work release, paid restitution to certain victims, and\n\nregistered as a sex offender. The agreement was reportedly struck before investigators had\n\nfinished interviewing all the alleged victims and was kept secret from some of Epstein’s\nvictims.

For the reasons set forth above,\nany draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will\ndiscuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports,\nto the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. While\nthe prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the\nGovernment understands that those atorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report\nhave not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term.

At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024711.jpg": "Page 72\nA .\nForm 583 Report of Incident\nIncident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: Date/Time Of Incident: 7/23/2ol9 l:27 AM\noo76\nSection l: General Information\n\nStaff Aware Date: 7/23/2ol9 l:27 AM\nFBI Notified: No USMS Notified: No Indicate Where Incident Occurred: Main Facility\nLocation Level l: SHU Level 2: Housing Unit, Special (SHU) Level 3: 9 SOUTH SHU\nTypeOfincident: Institution Locked Doun: No\n5 Assault On Inmate Modified Operations: No\n\nAssault On Staff\n\nCause Of Incident Knoun?

Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2482l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024825.jpg": "Page 287 |\ndid not return from court.

According to the Report\nof Incident, on August lo, 2ol9, at approximately 6:33 a.m., while serving the breakfast meal in\nthe SHU, Range 9 South, Mr. Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell. Staff reportedly called\nfor medical assistance, activated the and began life-saving measures. Arriving staff\nstated they brought an automated external defibrillator (AED) and stretcher. Cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR) reportedly continued while the AED was placed on Mr. Epstein. The AED\nreportedly indicated no shock advised and CPR was continued. Mr. Epstein was escorted to\nHealth Services at approximately 6:39 a.m., and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at\n6:43 a.m. He was transported to the local hospital at approximately 7:lo a.m. Mr. Epstein was\npronounced deceased at 7:36 am. It was not possible to confirm this timeline without viewing\nvideo footage.\nCONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS_\nA general appreciation of risk factors for suicide specific to sex offenders is necessary when\nreviewing Mr. Epstein’s death. These factors, as well as more general risk factors for suicide,\nwere likely present. There are several common factors that increase risk for suicide in\nindividuals with a history of a sexual offense. These include stigma due to the nature of\nsexually-based crimes (both within society and the prison system), a disruption of the ability to\nutilize sex as a coping mechanism (which can lead to increased levels of distress and negative\naffect), and grief about loss experienced in regards to arrest. This grief may be secondary to the\nloss of former lifestyle, loss of physical items or collections related to sexual offenses, and/or the\nloss of perceived relationships with victims. Other factors that may increase risk for suicide\namong individuals accused of a sex offense include safety concerns, potentially long sentences,\nand lack of skills necessary to navigate social relationships in prison.\nMr. Epstein was a high-profile, pretrial detainee awaiting trial on sex trafficking offenses. He\nhad been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he\naccumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>.

Follouing that, he held a\nnumber of positions in the financial industry to include a position as a limited partner at\nBear Stearns until he was dismissed for unknoun policy violations in l98l. He also worked as a\nfinancial consultant and founded at least two separate companies.\nMr. Epstein had two significant periods of employment. The first of these was his position as a\nconsultant wit the late l98os. pee age described as his\nfirst mentor. as later convicted and incarcerated for running a large Ponzi\nscheme. He implicated Mr. Epstein in fraudulently diverting company funds for his oun\npersonal use. Years later Or Mr. Epstein’s sole client at J. Epstein and Company,\ngranted him pouer of atorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span>\nand charismatic personality.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk. As a result, Mr. Epstein’s\nproposed bail package was determined to be inadequate. He was denied pretrial release and held\non remand.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27284", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027316.jpg": "Form 583 Report of Incident\nIncident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: Skipper-Sot, S.

At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “<span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss <span class=\"highlight\">intelligence</span> information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026904.tif": "Page 33l5\nForm 583 Report of incident\nincident #: NYM-l9- Submited By: N’ Diaye, L.
